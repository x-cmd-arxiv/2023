  Reconstruction Framework for Accelerated PET","Accepted at Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI 2023)",,,,"eess.IV cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Patient motion during PET is inevitable. Its long acquisition time not only
increases the motion and the associated artifacts but also the patient's
discomfort, thus PET acceleration is desirable. However, accelerating PET
acquisition will result in reconstructed images with low SNR, and the image
quality will still be degraded by motion-induced artifacts. Most of the
previous PET motion correction methods are motion type specific that require
motion modeling, thus may fail when multiple types of motion present together.
Also, those methods are customized for standard long acquisition and could not
be directly applied to accelerated PET. To this end, modeling-free universal
motion correction reconstruction for accelerated PET is still highly
under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-aided motion
correction and reconstruction framework for accelerated PET, called
Fast-MC-PET. Our framework consists of a universal motion correction (UMC) and
a short-to-long acquisition reconstruction (SL-Reon) module. The UMC enables
modeling-free motion correction by estimating quasi-continuous motion from
ultra-short frame reconstructions and using this information for
motion-compensated reconstruction. Then, the SL-Recon converts the accelerated
UMC image with low counts to a high-quality image with high counts for our
final reconstruction output. Our experimental results on human studies show
that our Fast-MC-PET can enable 7-fold acceleration and use only 2 minutes
acquisition to generate high-quality reconstruction images that
outperform/match previous motion correction reconstruction methods using
standard 15 minutes long acquisition data.

  https://github.com/MingruiLiu-ML-Lab/episode",,,,"cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gradient clipping is an important technique for deep neural networks with
exploding gradients, such as recurrent neural networks. Recent studies have
shown that the loss functions of these networks do not satisfy the conventional
smoothness condition, but instead satisfy a relaxed smoothness condition, i.e.,
the Lipschitz constant of the gradient scales linearly in terms of the gradient
norm. Due to this observation, several gradient clipping algorithms have been
developed for nonconvex and relaxed-smooth functions. However, the existing
algorithms only apply to the single-machine or multiple-machine setting with
homogeneous data across machines. It remains unclear how to design provably
efficient gradient clipping algorithms in the general Federated Learning (FL)
setting with heterogeneous data and limited communication rounds. In this
paper, we design EPISODE, the very first algorithm to solve FL problems with
heterogeneous data in the nonconvex and relaxed smoothness setting. The key
ingredients of the algorithm are two new techniques called \textit{episodic
gradient clipping} and \textit{periodic resampled corrections}. At the
beginning of each round, EPISODE resamples stochastic gradients from each
client and obtains the global averaged gradient, which is used to (1) determine
whether to apply gradient clipping for the entire round and (2) construct local
gradient corrections for each client. Notably, our algorithm and analysis
provide a unified framework for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data under
any noise level of the stochastic gradient, and it achieves state-of-the-art
complexity results. In particular, we prove that EPISODE can achieve linear
speedup in the number of machines, and it requires significantly fewer
communication rounds. Experiments on several heterogeneous datasets show the
superior performance of EPISODE over several strong baselines in FL.

failure. Recently, Lung Ultrasound (LUS), due to its radiation free nature,
portability, and being cheaper is gaining wide acceptability as a diagnostic
tool for lung conditions. However, lack of highly trained medical professionals
has limited its use especially in remote areas. To address this, an automated
screening system that captures characteristics of the LUS patterns can be of
significant assistance to clinicians who are not experts in lung ultrasound
(LUS) images. In this paper, we propose a feature extraction method designed to
quantify the spatially-localized line patterns and texture patterns found in
LUS images. Using the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) and four
types of common image features we propose a method to classify the LUS images
into 6 common neonatal lung conditions. These conditions are normal lung,
pneumothorax (PTX), transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN), respiratory
distress syndrome (RDS), chronic lung disease (CLD) and consolidation (CON)
that could be pneumonia or atelectasis. The proposed method using DTCWT
decomposition extracted global statistical, grey-level co-occurrence matrix
(GLCM), grey-level run length matrix (GLRLM) and linear binary pattern (LBP)
features to be fed to a linear discriminative analysis (LDA) based classifier.
Using 15 best DTCWT features along with 3 clinical features the proposed
approach achieved a per-image classification accuracy of 92.78% with a balanced

deepening the understanding of light-matter coupling. However, they often rely
on very different experimental set-ups and theoretical descriptions. Here, we
experimentally investigate the transition from cavity to waveguide QED with an
ensemble of cold atoms that is coupled to a fiber-ring resonator, which
contains a nanofiber section. By varying the length of the resonator from a few
meters to several tens of meters, we tailor the spectral density of modes of
the resonator while remaining in the strong coupling regime. We demonstrate
that for progressively longer resonators, the paradigmatic Rabi oscillations of

simultaneously coupled to both a two-level system and yttrium-iron-garnet

the degrees of freedom of the magnons. We show that the Kerr magnons induced

the intrinsic AT, the critical coupling strength can be dramatically reduced by
introducing the Kerr magnons, which greatly relaxes the experimental conditions

  Big Data",,"10.1109/TBDATA.2023.3237397",,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Byzantine-robust federated learning aims at mitigating Byzantine failures
during the federated training process, where malicious participants may upload
arbitrary local updates to the central server to degrade the performance of the
global model. In recent years, several robust aggregation schemes have been
proposed to defend against malicious updates from Byzantine clients and improve
the robustness of federated learning. These solutions were claimed to be
Byzantine-robust, under certain assumptions. Other than that, new attack
strategies are emerging, striving to circumvent the defense schemes. However,
there is a lack of systematic comparison and empirical study thereof. In this
paper, we conduct an experimental study of Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes
under different attacks using two popular algorithms in federated learning,
FedSGD and FedAvg . We first survey existing Byzantine attack strategies and
Byzantine-robust aggregation schemes that aim to defend against Byzantine
attacks. We also propose a new scheme, ClippedClustering , to enhance the
robustness of a clustering-based scheme by automatically clipping the updates.
Then we provide an experimental evaluation of eight aggregation schemes in the
scenario of five different Byzantine attacks. Our results show that these
aggregation schemes sustain relatively high accuracy in some cases but are
ineffective in others. In particular, our proposed ClippedClustering
successfully defends against most attacks under independent and IID local
datasets. However, when the local datasets are Non-IID, the performance of all
the aggregation schemes significantly decreases. With Non-IID data, some of
these aggregation schemes fail even in the complete absence of Byzantine
clients. We conclude that the robustness of all the aggregation schemes is
limited, highlighting the need for new defense strategies, in particular for
Non-IID datasets.

localization $G\overset{\lambda^*}{\curvearrowright}X^*$, where $G$ is the
group of left fractions of $S$; analogously, for a right action
$K\overset{\rho}\curvearrowleft S$ on a compact space $K$, we construct its Ore
colocalization $K^*\overset{\rho^*}{\curvearrowleft} G$. Both constructions
preserve entropy, i.e., for the algebraic entropy $h_{\mathrm{alg}}$ and for
the topological entropy $h_{\mathrm{top}}$ one has
$h_{\mathrm{alg}}(\lambda)=h_{\mathrm{alg}}(\lambda^*)$ and
$h_{\mathrm{top}}(\rho)=h_{\mathrm{top}}(\rho^*)$, respectively.
  Exploiting these constructions and the theory of quasi-tilings, we extend the
Addition Theorem for $h_{\mathrm{top}}$, known for right actions of countable
amenable groups on compact metrizable groups, to right actions
$K\overset{\rho}{\curvearrowleft} S$ of cancellative right amenable monoids $S$
(with no restrictions on the cardinality) on arbitrary compact groups $K$.
  When the compact group $K$ is Abelian, we prove that $h_{\mathrm{top}}(\rho)$
coincides with $h_{\mathrm{alg}}(\hat{\rho})$, where
$S\overset{\hat{\rho}}\curvearrowright X$ is the dual left action on the
discrete Pontryagin dual $X=\hat{K}$, that is, a so-called Bridge Theorem. From
the Addition Theorem for $h_{\mathrm{top}}$ and the Bridge Theorem, we obtain
an Addition Theorem for $h_{\mathrm{alg}}$ for left actions
$S\overset{\lambda}\curvearrowright X$ on discrete Abelian groups, so far known
only under the hypotheses that either $X$ is torsion or $S$ is locally
monotileable.
  The proofs substantially use the unified approach towards entropy based on
the entropy of actions of cancellative right amenable monoids on appropriately
defined normed monoids.

global tracking of industrial activities. Use cases span many applications,
from weather forecasting to digital maps, carbon footprint tracking, and

difficult to manufacture, expensive to maintain, and tricky to launch into
orbit. Therefore, it is critical that satellites are employed efficiently. This
poses a challenge known as the satellite mission planning problem, which could
be computationally prohibitive to solve on large scales. However,
close-to-optimal algorithms can often provide satisfactory resolutions, such as
greedy reinforcement learning, and optimization algorithms. This paper
introduces a set of quantum algorithms to solve the mission planning problem
and demonstrate an advantage over the classical algorithms implemented thus
far. The problem is formulated as maximizing the number of high-priority tasks
completed on real datasets containing thousands of tasks and multiple
satellites. This work demonstrates that through solution-chaining and
clustering, optimization and machine learning algorithms offer the greatest
potential for optimal solutions. Most notably, this paper illustrates that a
hybridized quantum-enhanced reinforcement learning agent can achieve a
completion percentage of 98.5% over high-priority tasks, which is a significant
improvement over the baseline greedy methods with a completion rate of 63.6%.
The results presented in this work pave the way to quantum-enabled solutions in

the reggeon-pomeron and odderon-pomeron fusion reactions. We present
predictions for the measurements of photons at midrapidity, $|{\rm y}| < 2.5$,
and at relatively low transverse momentum, $0.1~{\rm GeV} < k_{\perp} < 1~{\rm
GeV}$. To check the main results of our study the measurement of the outgoing
protons is not necessary. This is of relevance, e.g., for the present version
of the ALICE detector at the LHC. Several differential distributions, for
instance, in ${\rm y}$, $k_{\perp}$ and $\omega$, the rapidity, the absolute
value of the transverse momentum, and the energy of the photon, respectively,
are presented. We show that the photoproduction is an important process in the
kinematic region specified above. There it gives a much larger cross section
than diffractive bremsstrahlung. This is remarkable as the CEP cross section is
of order $\alpha_{\rm em}^{3}$ whereas the bremsstrahlung one is only of order
$\alpha_{\rm em}$. On the other hand, the soft-photon bremsstrahlung where the
basic $pp \to pp$ reaction is due to strong interaction diffraction is more
important than CEP in the forward rapidity range, $|{\rm y}| > 4$, and/or at
very low $k_{\perp}$. We leave it as a challenge for the planned ALICE 3

investigate the effect of the size, content and distribution of carbon
nanotubes on the thermal conductivity of geopolymer nanocomposites, and the
microscopic mechanism is analyzed by the phonon density of states, phonon
participation ratio and spectral thermal conductivity, etc. The results show
that there is a significant size effect in geopolymer nanocomposites system due
to the carbon nanotubes. In addition, when the content of carbon nanotubes is
16.5%, the thermal conductivity in carbon nanotubes vertical axial direction
(4.85 W/(mk)) increases 125.6% compared with the system without carbon
nanotubes (2.15 W/(mk)). However, the thermal conductivity in carbon nanotubes
vertical axial direction (1.25 W/(mk)) decreases 41.9%, which is mainly due to
the interfacial thermal resistance and phonon scattering at the interfaces. The
above results provide theoretical guidance for the tunable thermal conductivity

the orientation of the polarization at the interface. This leads to several

concerning the global dynamics of two-phase complex fluids with interfacial

existence of global weak solutions in two and three dimensions. Secondly, we
show that weak solutions are unique and globally regular in the two dimensional

Furthermore, we incorporate a generative adversarial training approach into our

Standard Model imposing the existence of a scalar basis where all couplings are
real is a sufficient condition for CP to be explicitly conserved. We discuss a
three-Higgs-doublet model with an underlying $S_3$ symmetry, allowing in
principle for complex couplings. In this framework it is possible to have
either spontaneous or explicit CP violation in the scalar sector, depending on
the regions of parameter space corresponding to the different possible vacua of
the $S_3$ symmetric potential. We list all possible vacuum structures allowing
for CP violation in the scalar sector specifying whether it can be explicit or

what had been expected for the tectonic setting in Southeastern Turkey. By
using near-field records we provide evidence for early supershear transition on
the splay fault that hosted the nucleation and early propagation of the first
rupture that eventually transitioned into the East Anatolian fault. The two
stations located furthest from the epicenter show a larger fault parallel
particle velocity component relative to the fault normal particle velocity
component; a unique signature of supershear ruptures that has been identified
in theoretical and experimental models of intersonic rupture growth. The third
station located closest to the epicenter, while mostly preserving the classical
sub-Rayleigh characteristics, it also features a small supershear pulse clearly
propagating ahead of the original sub-Rayleigh rupture. This record provides,
for the first time ever, field observational evidence for the mechanism of
intersonic transition. By using the two furthest stations we estimate the
instantaneous supershear rupture propagation speed to be ~ 1.55 Cs and the
sub-Rayleigh to supershear transition length to be around 19.45 km, very close
to the location of the station nearest to the epicenter. This early supershear
transition might have facilitated the continued propagation and triggering of
slip on the nearby East Anatolian Fault leading to amplification of the hazard.

  learning. Application of knowledge distillation as aggregation of ensemble
  models. Along with several uses. 140 pages, 67 figures, 13 tables",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning has contributed greatly to many successes in artificial
intelligence in recent years. Today, it is possible to train models that have
thousands of layers and hundreds of billions of parameters. Large-scale deep
models have achieved great success, but the enormous computational complexity
and gigantic storage requirements make it extremely difficult to implement them
in real-time applications. On the other hand, the size of the dataset is still
a real problem in many domains. Data are often missing, too expensive, or
impossible to obtain for other reasons. Ensemble learning is partially a
solution to the problem of small datasets and overfitting. However, ensemble
learning in its basic version is associated with a linear increase in
computational complexity. We analyzed the impact of the ensemble
decision-fusion mechanism and checked various methods of sharing the decisions
including voting algorithms. We used the modified knowledge distillation
framework as a decision-fusion mechanism which allows in addition compressing
of the entire ensemble model into a weight space of a single model. We showed
that knowledge distillation can aggregate knowledge from multiple teachers in
only one student model and, with the same computational complexity, obtain a
better-performing model compared to a model trained in the standard manner. We
have developed our own method for mimicking the responses of all teachers at
the same time, simultaneously. We tested these solutions on several benchmark
datasets. In the end, we presented a wide application use of the efficient
multi-teacher knowledge distillation framework. In the first example, we used
knowledge distillation to develop models that could automate corrosion
detection on aircraft fuselage. The second example describes detection of smoke
on observation cameras in order to counteract wildfires in forests.

approaches to extending principal component analysis (PCA) from usual data

This work aims to specifically address these questions. In particular, we
clarify the subtle difference between PCA and singular value decomposition
(SVD) for multiway data, and show that multiway principal components (PCs) can
be estimated reliably in absence of the eigengaps required by the usual PCA,
and in general much more efficiently than the usual PCs. Furthermore, the
sample multiway PCs are asymptotically independent and hence allow for separate

multiway PCA are further demonstrated through numerical, both simulated and

protect against training data reconstruction, then utility of private models
can be improved because less noise is required to protect against these more

pervading software organizations. This can lead software engineers to act like
chess players playing a gambit -- making sacrifices of their technically sound
estimates, thus submitting their teams to time pressure. In turn, time pressure
can have varied detrimental effects, such as poor product quality and emotional
distress, decreasing productivity, which leads to more time pressure and
delays: a hard-to-stop vicious cycle. This reveals a need for moving on from
the more passive strategy of yielding to pressure to a more active one of
defending software estimates. Therefore, we propose an approach to support
software estimators in acquiring knowledge on how to carry out such defense, by
introducing negotiation principles encapsulated in a set of defense lenses,
presented through a digital simulation. We evaluated the proposed approach
through a controlled experiment with software practitioners from different
companies. We collected data on participants' attitudes, subjective norms,
perceived behavioral control, and intentions to perform the defense of their
estimates in light of the Theory of Planned Behavior. We employed a frequentist
and a bayesian approach to data analysis. Results show improved scores among
experimental group participants after engaging with the digital simulation and
learning about the lenses. They were also more inclined to choose a defense
action when facing pressure scenarios than a control group exposed to questions
to reflect on the reasons and outcomes of pressure over estimates. Qualitative
evidence reveals that practitioners perceived the set of lenses as useful in
their current work environments. Collectively, these results show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach and its perceived relevance for the
industry, despite the low amount of time required to engage with it.

current sheet crossing (PCS), and they share some common features but also have
different properties. In this work, using the PSP observations from encounters
4 to 10, we identify streamer belt solar wind from enhancements in plasma beta,
and we further use electron pitch angle distributions to separate it into HPS
solar wind that around the full HCS crossings and PCS solar wind that in the
vicinity of PCS crossings. Based on our analysis, we find that the PCS solar
wind has different characteristics as compared with HPS solar wind: a) PCS
solar wind could be non-pressure-balanced structures rather than magnetic
holes, and the total pressure enhancement mainly results from the less reduced
magnetic pressure; b) some of the PCS solar wind are mirror unstable; c) PCS
solar wind is dominated by very low helium abundance but varied alpha-proton
differential speed. We suggest the PCS solar wind could originate from coronal
loops deep inside the streamer belt, and it is pristine solar wind that still

whether BERT aligns with human semantic intuitions when dealing with
expressions (e.g., sunlight) whose overall meaning depends -- to a various
extent -- on the semantics of the constituent words (sun, light). We leverage a
dataset that includes human judgments on two psycholinguistic measures of
compound semantic analysis: lexeme meaning dominance (LMD; quantifying the
weight of each constituent toward the compound meaning) and semantic
transparency (ST; evaluating the extent to which the compound meaning is
recoverable from the constituents' semantics). We show that BERT-based measures
moderately align with human intuitions, especially when using contextualized
representations, and that LMD is overall more predictable than ST. Contrary to
the results reported for 'standard' words, higher, more contextualized layers
are the best at representing compound meaning. These findings shed new light on
the abilities of BERT in dealing with fine-grained semantic phenomena.
Moreover, they can provide insights into how speakers represent compounds.

with the expected form of a high-redshift galaxy: a clear blue continuum from
1.5 to 4 microns with a complete dropout in F115W. The core of GN-z11 is
extremely compact in JWST imaging. We analyze the image with a two-component
model, using a point source and a S\'{e}rsic profile that fits to a half-light
radius of 200 pc and an index $n=0.9$. We find a low-surface brightness haze
about $0.4''$ to the northeast of the galaxy, which is most likely a foreground
object but might be a more extended component of GN-z11. At a spectroscopic
redshift of 10.60 (Bunker et al. 2023), the comparison of the NIRCam F410M and
F444W images spans the Balmer jump. From population synthesis modeling, here

problems on strings. This work demonstrates that new, faster quantum algorithms
can be designed when the string is highly compressible. We focus on two popular
and theoretically significant compression algorithms -- the Lempel-Ziv77
algorithm (LZ77) and the Run-length-encoded Burrows-Wheeler Transform (RL-BWT),
and obtain the results below.
  We first provide a quantum algorithm running in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{zn})$ time
for finding the LZ77 factorization of an input string $T[1..n]$ with $z$
factors. Combined with multiple existing results, this yields an
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{rn})$ time quantum algorithm for finding the RL-BWT encoding
with $r$ BWT runs. Note that $r = \tilde{\Theta}(z)$. We complement these
results with lower bounds proving that our algorithms are optimal (up to
polylog factors).
  Next, we study the problem of compressed indexing, where we provide a
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{rn})$ time quantum algorithm for constructing a recently
designed $\tilde{O}(r)$ space structure with equivalent capabilities as the
suffix tree. This data structure is then applied to numerous problems to obtain
sublinear time quantum algorithms when the input is highly compressible. For
example, we show that the longest common substring of two strings of total
length $n$ can be computed in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{zn})$ time, where $z$ is the
number of factors in the LZ77 factorization of their concatenation. This beats
the best known $\tilde{O}(n^\frac{2}{3})$ time quantum algorithm when $z$ is
sufficiently small.

integrate semantic concepts with 3D maps largely remain confined to the
closed-set setting: they can only reason about a finite set of concepts,

class labels, or in recent work, using text prompts.
  We address both these issues with ConceptFusion, a scene representation that
is (1) fundamentally open-set, enabling reasoning beyond a closed set of

queries to the 3D map, from language, to images, to audio, to 3D geometry, all
working in concert. ConceptFusion leverages the open-set capabilities of
today's foundation models pre-trained on internet-scale data to reason about
concepts across modalities such as natural language, images, and audio. We
demonstrate that pixel-aligned open-set features can be fused into 3D maps via
traditional SLAM and multi-view fusion approaches. This enables effective
zero-shot spatial reasoning, not needing any additional training or finetuning,
and retains long-tailed concepts better than supervised approaches,
outperforming them by more than 40% margin on 3D IoU. We extensively evaluate

within the framework provided by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of
superconductivity shows that this is a multigap system. The energy gap data can
be better explained within the framework of topologically protected flat bands
applied to systems in which superconductivity occurs on the surface or at the
internal interfaces of the samples. The temperature dependence of the SC gap is
linear above 50 K. We use nonlocal differential conductance Gdiff(V) = dI(V)/dV
experimental data to show clear evidence of topological phenomena such as
interference of chiral asymmetric Andreev edge states and crossed Andreev
conversion. Gdiff(V) has a negative part that results from the nonlocal

been proposed and implemented to help programmers identify potential errors is
to highlight uncertain tokens. However, there have been no empirical studies
exploring the effectiveness of this technique-- nor investigating the different
and not-yet-agreed-upon notions of uncertainty in the context of generative
models. We explore the question of whether conveying information about
uncertainty enables programmers to more quickly and accurately produce code
when collaborating with an AI-powered code completion tool, and if so, what
measure of uncertainty best fits programmers' needs. Through a mixed-methods
study with 30 programmers, we compare three conditions: providing the AI
system's code completion alone, highlighting tokens with the lowest likelihood
of being generated by the underlying generative model, and highlighting tokens
with the highest predicted likelihood of being edited by a programmer. We find
that highlighting tokens with the highest predicted likelihood of being edited
leads to faster task completion and more targeted edits, and is subjectively
preferred by study participants. In contrast, highlighting tokens according to
their probability of being generated does not provide any benefit over the
baseline with no highlighting. We further explore the design space of how to
convey uncertainty in AI-powered code completion tools, and find that
programmers prefer highlights that are granular, informative, interpretable,

effective potential allows for hilltop inflation in the early Universe. In the
late Universe, the Hubble friction overdamps the final quadratic approach to
the effective minimum at the condensate, where the value of the potential
becomes the cosmological constant. We do not consider particle production

heavier than helium are created inside stars and are ejected when they die.
From the spatial distribution of elements in galaxies, it is therefore possible

Galaxy with a vast amount of data from Gaia satellite and multi-object
spectrographs to understand the origins of sub-structures of the Milky Way.
Thanks to integral field units, this approach can also be applied to external
galaxies from nearby to distant universe with the James Webb Space Telescope.
In order to interpret these observational data, it is necessary to compare with
theoretical predictions, namely chemodynamical simulations of galaxies, which
include detailed chemical enrichment into hydrodynamical simulations from
cosmological initial conditions. These simulations can predict the evolution of
internal structures (e.g., metallicity radial gradients) as well as that of
scaling relations (e.g., the mass-metallicity relations). After explaining the

candidate $z>10$ Lyman break galaxy in the GOODS-North field with
$M_{UV}=-21.5$. We derive a redshift of $z=10.603$ (lower than previous
determinations) based on multiple emission lines in our low and medium
resolution spectra over $0.8-5.3 \mu$m. We significantly detect the continuum
and measure a blue rest-UV spectral slope of $\beta=-2.4$. Remarkably, we see
spatially-extended Lyman-$\alpha$ in emission (despite the highly-neutral IGM
expected at this early epoch), offset 555 km s$^{-1}$ redward of the systemic
redshift. From our measurements of collisionally-excited lines of both low- and
high-ionization (including [O II]$\lambda3727$, [Ne III]$\lambda 3869$ and C
III]$\lambda1909$) we infer a high ionization parameter ($\log U\sim -2$). We
detect the rarely-seen N IV]$\lambda1486$ and N III]$\lambda1748$ lines in both
our low and medium resolution spectra, with other high ionization lines seen in
the low resolution spectrum such as He II (blended with O III]) and C IV (with
a possible P-Cygni profile). Based on the observed rest-UV line ratios, we
cannot conclusively rule out photoionization from AGN, although the high C
III]/He II and N III]/He II ratios are compatible with a star-formation
explanation. If the observed emission lines are powered by star formation, then
the strong N III]$\lambda1748$ observed may imply an unusually high $N/O$
abundance. Balmer emission lines (H$\gamma$, H$\delta$) are also detected, and
if powered by star formation rather than an AGN we infer a star formation rate
of $\sim 20-30 M_{\odot} yr^{-1}$ (depending on the IMF) and low dust
attenuation. Our NIRSpec spectroscopy confirms that GN-z11 is a remarkable
galaxy with extreme properties seen 430 Myr after the Big Bang.

achieved by designing a source finder to track the positions of ~ 2000 stars in
NACO/VLT adaptive-optics-assisted images of the Galactic Center from 2002 to
2019. Of the studied stars, 54 exhibit significant accelerations toward Sgr A*,
most of which have separations of between 2 and 3 arcseconds from the black

SINFONI/VLT stellar spectra, which allows for the calculation of the orbital
elements for these stars, thus increasing the number of known orbits in the
Galactic Center by ~ 40 %. With orbits, we can consider which structural
features within the Galactic Center nuclear star cluster these stars belong to.
Most of the stars have orbital solutions that are consistent with the known
clockwise rotating disk feature. Further, by employing Monte Carlo sampling for

We hunt for oscillations, which will be an essential ingredient for accurately

are occasionally associated with the launch of relativistic jets that power $
\gamma $-ray bursts (GRBs). Thus, collapsars offer an opportunity to infer the
natal (before spin-up/down by accretion) BH spin directly from observations. We
show that once the BH saturates with large-scale magnetic flux, the jet power
is dictated by the BH spin and mass accretion rate. Core-collapse simulations
by Halevi et al. 2023 and GRB observations favor stellar density profiles that
yield an accretion rate $ \dot{m} \approx 10^{-2} M_\odot~{\rm s^{-1}} $,
weakly dependent on time. This leaves the spin as the main factor that governs
the jet power. By comparing the jet power to characteristic GRB luminosities,
we find that the majority of BHs associated with jets are likely born slowly
spinning with a dimensionless spin $ a \simeq 0.2 $, or $ a \lesssim 0.5 $ for
wobbling jets, with the main uncertainty originating in the unknown $ \gamma
$-ray radiative efficiency. This result could be applied to the entire
core-collapse BH population, unless an anti-correlation between the stellar
magnetic field and angular momentum is present. In a companion paper,
Jacquemin-Ide et al. 2023, we show that regardless of the natal spin, the
extraction of BH rotational energy leads to spin-down to $ a \lesssim 0.2 $,
consistent with gravitational-wave observations. We verify our results by
performing the first 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of
collapsar jets with characteristic GRB energies, powered by slowly spinning
BHs. We find that jets of typical GRB power struggle to escape from the star,
providing the first numerical indication that many jets fail to generate a GRB.

is flat. We further show that AGN-host galaxy decomposition is critical for
estimating SFR distribution, as point source subtraction reduces the estimated
central SFR surface density $\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ by over a factor of three.
With this correction, spatially resolved measurements of
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{SFR}}$ and the surface gas mass density
$\Sigma_{\mathrm{gas}}$ form a roughly linear sequence in the Kennicutt-Schmidt
diagram with a constant gas depletion time of 50-200 Myr.

magnetized neutron stars) are still unknown. We identify instabilities in
relativistic magnetospheres that can explain a range of X-ray flare
luminosities. Crustal surface motions can twist the magnetar magnetosphere by
shifting the frozen-in footpoints of magnetic field lines in current-carrying
flux bundles. Axisymmetric (2D) magnetospheres exhibit strong eruptive
dynamics, as to say, catastrophic lateral instabilities triggered by a critical
footpoint displacement of $\psi_{\rm crit}\gtrsim\pi$. In contrast, our new
three-dimensional (3D) twist models with finite surface extension capture
important non-axisymmetric dynamics of twisted force-free flux bundles in
dipolar magnetospheres. Besides the well-established global eruption resulting
(as in 2D) from lateral instabilities, such 3D structures can develop helical,
kink-like dynamics, and dissipate energy locally (confined eruptions). Up to
$25\%$ of the induced twist energy is dissipated and available to power X-ray
flares in powerful global eruptions, with most of our models showing an energy
release in the range of the most common X-ray outbursts, $\lesssim 10^{43}$erg.
Such events occur when significant energy builds up deeply buried in the dipole
magnetosphere. Less energetic outbursts likely precede powerful flares, due to
intermittent instabilities and confined eruptions of a continuously twisting
flux tube. Upon reaching a critical state, global eruptions produce the
necessary Poynting-flux-dominated outflows required by models prescribing the
fast radio burst production in the magnetar wind -- for example, via
relativistic magnetic reconnection or shocks.

scheme of galaxy morphologies, calibrated on mock images from the TNG50

properties of the simulated galaxies, including their 3D structure. We apply
the method simultaneously to F200W and F356W galaxy images of a mass-complete

same manifold in the representation space from contrastive learning, partly
because the observed galaxies tend to be more compact and more elongated than
the simulated galaxies. We also find that about half the galaxies that were
visually classified as disks based on their elongated images actually populate
a similar region of the representation space than spheroids, which according to
the TNG50 simulation is occupied by objects with low stellar specific angular
momentum and non-oblate structure. This suggests that the disk fraction at $z >

misclassifying compact, elongated galaxies as disks. Deeper imaging and/or
spectroscopic follow-ups as well as comparisons with other simulations will
help to unambiguously determine the true nature of these galaxies.

galaxies with both far-infrared (FIR: 154 $\mu$m) dust polarimetric
observations taken from the Survey of ExtragALactic magnetiSm with SOFIA
(SALSA) and radio (6 cm) synchrotron polarization observations. We find that
the main contribution to the B-field structure of these spiral galaxies comes
from the $m=2$ and $m=0$ modes at FIR wavelengths and the $m=2$ mode at radio
wavelengths. The $m=2$ mode has a spiral structure and is directly related to
the magnetic pitch angle, while $m=0$ has a constant B-field orientation. The
FIR data tend to have a higher relative contribution from other modes than the
radio data. The extreme case is NGC 6946: all modes contribute similarly in the
FIR, while $m=2$ still dominates in the radio. The average magnetic pitch angle
in the FIR data is smaller and has greater angular dispersion than in the
radio, indicating that the B-fields in the disk midplane traced by FIR dust
polarization are more tightly wound and more chaotic than the B-field structure
in the radio, which probes a larger volume. We argue that our approach is more
flexible and model-independent than standard techniques, while still producing
consistent results where directly comparable.

evolves from its natal value due to two competing processes: accretion of gas
angular momentum that increases the spin, and extraction of BH angular momentum
by outflows that decreases the spin. Ultimately, the final, equilibrium spin is
set by the balance between both processes. In order for the BH to launch
relativistic jets and power a $ \gamma $-ray burst (GRB), the BH magnetic field
needs to be dynamically important. Thus, we consider the case of a magnetically
arrested disk (MAD) driving the spin evolution of the BH. By applying the
semi-analytic MAD BH spin evolution model of Lowell et al. (2023) to
collapsars, we show that if the BH accretes $ \sim 20\% $ of its initial mass,
its dimensionless spin inevitably reaches small values, $ a \lesssim 0.2 $. For
such spins, and for mass accretion rates inferred from collapsar simulations,
we show that our semi-analytic model reproduces the energetics of typical GRB
jets, $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{50}\,\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$. We show that our
semi-analytic model reproduces the nearly constant power of typical GRB jets.
If the MAD onset is delayed, this allows powerful jets at the high end of the
GRB luminosity distribution, $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{52}\,\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$, but
the final spin remains low, $ a \lesssim 0.3 $. These results are consistent
with the low spins inferred from gravitational wave detections of binary BH
mergers. In a companion paper, Gottlieb et al. (2023), we use GRB observations
to constrain the natal BH spin to be $ a \simeq 0.2 $.

generalized noncontextuality. Many criticisms and concerns have been raised,
however, regarding the definition of this notion and of the possibility of
testing it experimentally. In this work, we respond to some of the most common
of these objections. One such objection is that the existence of a classical
record of which laboratory procedure was actually performed in each run of an
experiment implies that the operational equivalence relations that are a
necessary ingredient of any proof of the failure of noncontextuality do not
hold, and consequently that conclusions of nonclassicality based on these

a very particular interplay between the three quark generations, as described
by the Cabibbo--Kobayashi--Maskawa (CKM) mechanism and the single Jarlskog
invariant $J_4$. Once generalized to the Standard Model Effective Field Theory
(SMEFT), this peculiar pattern gets modified by higher-dimensional operators,
whose associated Wilson coefficients are usually split into CP-even and odd
parts. However, CP violation at dimension four, i.e., at the lowest order in
the EFT expansion, blurs this distinction: any Wilson coefficient can interfere
with $J_4$ and mediate CP violation. In this paper, we study such interferences
at first order in the SMEFT expansion, $\order{1/\Lambda^2}$, and we capture
their associated parameter space via a set of 1551 linear CP-odd flavor
invariants. This construction describes both new, genuinely CP-violating
quantities as well as the interference between $J_4$ and CP-conserving ones. We
call this latter possibility \textit{opportunistic CP violation}. Relying on an
appropriate extension of the matrix rank to Taylor expansions, which we dub
\emph{Taylor rank}, we define a procedure to organize the invariants in terms
of their magnitude, so as to retain only the relevant ones at a given
precision. We explore how this characterization changes when different
assumptions are made on the flavor structure of the SMEFT coefficients.
Interestingly, some of the CP-odd invariants turn out to be less suppressed
than $J_4$, even when they capture opportunistic CPV, demonstrating that
CP-violation in the SM, at dimension 4, is \textit{accidentally small.}

mass, spin, and redshift distributions of the merging binary black hole
population. Our present knowledge of these distributions, however, is based
largely on strongly parameteric models; such models typically assume the
distributions of binary parameters to be superpositions of power laws, peaks,
dips, and breaks, and then measure the parameters governing these ""building
block"" features. Although this approach has yielded great progress in initial
characterization of the compact binary population, the strong assumptions
entailed leave it often unclear which physical conclusions are driven by
observation and which by the specific choice of model. In this paper, we
instead model the merger rate of binary black holes as an unknown
autoregressive process over the space of binary parameters, allowing us to
measure the distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, component
spins, and effective spins with near-complete agnosticism. We find the primary
mass spectrum of binary black holes to be doubly-peaked, with a fairly flat
continuum that steepens at high masses. We identify signs of unexpected
structure in the redshift distribution of binary black holes: a
uniform-in-comoving volume merger rate at low redshift followed by a rise in
the merger rate beyond redshift $z\approx 0.5$. Finally, we find that the
distribution of black hole spin magnitudes is unimodal and concentrated at
small but non-zero values, and that spin orientations span a wide range of
spin-orbit misalignment angles but are also unlikely to be truly isotropic.

  II Multi-Arm Multi-Stage Studies","16 pages, 6 main text figures, 3 supplemental figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a multi-metric flexible Bayesian framework to support efficient
interim decision-making in multi-arm multi-stage phase II clinical trials.
Multi-arm multi-stage phase II studies increase the efficiency of drug
development, but early decisions regarding the futility or desirability of a
given arm carry considerable risk since sample sizes are often low and
follow-up periods may be short. Further, since intermediate outcomes based on
biomarkers of treatment response are rarely perfect surrogates for the primary
outcome and different trial stakeholders may have different levels of risk
tolerance, a single hypothesis test is insufficient for comprehensively
summarizing the state of the collected evidence. We present a Bayesian
framework comprised of multiple metrics based on point estimates, uncertainty,
and evidence towards desired thresholds (a Target Product Profile, TPP) for 1)
ranking of arms and 2) comparison of each arm against an internal control.
Using a large public-private partnership targeting novel TB arms as a
motivating example, we find via simulation study that our multi-metric
framework provides sufficient confidence for decision-making with sample sizes
as low as 30 patients per arm, even when intermediate outcomes have only
moderate correlation with the primary outcome. Our reframing of trial design
and the decision-making procedure has been well-received by research partners
and is a practical approach to more efficient assessment of novel therapeutics.

method for nonlinear scalar hyperbolic equations in one space dimension. It is
well known that the exact solutions to such problems may contain shocks though
the initial conditions are smooth, and direct numerical methods may suffer from
restricted time step sizes. To relieve the restriction, we propose an ELFV
method, where the space-time domain was separated by the partition lines
originated from the cell interfaces whose slopes are obtained following the
Rakine-Hugoniot junmp condition. Unfortunately, to avoid the intersection of
the partition lines, the time step sizes are still limited. To fix this gap, we
detect effective troubled cells (ETCs) and carefully design the influence
region of each ETC, within which the partitioned space-time regions are merged
together to form a new one. Then with the new partition of the space-time
domain, we theoretically prove that the proposed first-order scheme with Euler
forward time discretization is total-variation-diminishing and
maximum-principle-preserving with {at least twice} larger time step constraints
than the classical first order Eulerian method for Burgers' equation. Numerical
experiments verify the optimality of the designed time step sizes.

might occur during the PN phase. The discovery of a handful of nova eruptions
and supersoft X-ray sources inside PNe supports this hypothesis. In this paper,
we investigate the impact that hosting a steadily-accreting WD would have on
the properties and evolution of a PN. By pairing the published accreting
nuclear-burning WD models with radiation transfer simulations, we extract the
time evolution of the emission line spectra and ionization properties of a PN
that surrounds a 0.6$\rm M_{\odot}$ steadily nuclear-burning WD as a function
of the mass accretion rate. We find that accreting WDs are able to form very
extended, high excitation, [O III]-bright PNe, which are characterised by high
nebular electron temperatures. Their properties remain almost invariant with
time and their visibility time can be much longer compared to PNe powered by
single WDs. We discuss the implications of our findings in explaining specific
characteristics observed in PNe. Finally, we examine how accreting WDs affect
the planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) by covering WD masses in the
range of 0.5-0.8$\rm M_{\odot}$ and for various accretion rates within the
steady accretion regime. We find that for all but the lowest accretion rates,
the [O III]-luminosities are almost constant and clustered very close to the
PNLF cut-off value. Our results suggest that mass-accreting WDs in interacting
binaries might play a role in understanding the invariant cut-off of the PNLF.

state configuration in $^{208}$Pb. The interaction of added neutron(s) and the
protons forming the $Z=82$ proton core is responsible for a major contribution
to the buildup of differential charge radii. It depends on the overlaps of
proton and neutron wave functions and leads to a redistribution of
single-particle density of occupied proton states which in turn modifies the
charge radii. Self-consistency effects affecting the shape of proton potential,
total proton densities and the energies of the single-particle proton states
provide only secondary contribution to differential charge radii. The buildup
of differential charge radii is a combination of single-particle and collective
phenomena. The former is due to proton-neutron interaction, the impact of which
is state dependent, and the latter reflects the fact that all occupied proton
single-particle states contribute to this process. The neglect of either one of
these aspects of the process by ignoring proton-neutron interaction and
self-consistency effects as it is done in macroscopic+microscopic approach or

better understand the complex progression of neurological disorders.
Inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) imaging is an emergent technique
that has a high degree of specificity for myelin content but suffers from low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This study used simulations to determine optimal
sequence parameters for ihMT imaging for use in high-resolution cortical
mapping. Methods: MT-weighted cortical image intensity and ihMT SNR were
simulated using modified Bloch equations for a range of sequence parameters.
The acquisition time was limited to 4.5 min/volume. A custom MT-weighted RAGE
sequence with center-out k-space encoding was used to enhance SNR at 3 Tesla.
Pulsed MT imaging was studied over a range of saturation parameters and the
impact of the turbo-factor on effective ihMT was investigated. 1 mm isotropic
ihMTsat maps were generated in 25 healthy adults using an optimized protocol.
Results: Greater SNR was observed for larger number of bursts consisting of 6-8
saturation pulses each, combined with a high readout turbo-factor. However,
that protocol suffered from a point spread function that was more than twice
the nominal resolution. For high-resolution cortical imaging, we selected a
protocol with a higher effective resolution at the cost of a lower SNR. We
present the first group-average ihMTsat whole-brain map at 1 mm isotropic
resolution. Conclusion: This study presents the impact of saturation and
excitation parameters on ihMTsat SNR and resolution. We demonstrate the
feasibility of high-resolution cortical myelin imaging using ihMTsat in less
than 20 minutes.

due to the intensive energy consumption of battery-powered clients for local

their early dropouts from edge networks, loss of training data jeopardizing the
performance of FL, and their availability to perform other designated tasks. In
this paper, we propose FedLE, an energy-efficient client selection framework

first run for a minimum epoch to generate their local model update. The models
are partially uploaded to the server for calculating similarities between each

theory for the kernel-based interpolation in that space is well understood and
optimal rates for the whole RKHS are often known. Schaback added the doubling
trick, which shows that functions having double the smoothness required by the
RKHS (along with complicated, but well understood boundary behavior) can be
approximated with higher convergence rates than the optimal rates for the whole
space. Other advances allowed interpolation of target functions which are less
smooth, and different norms which measure interpolation error. The current
state of the art of error analysis for RBF interpolation treats target
functions having smoothness up to twice that of the native space, but error
measured in norms which are weaker than that required for membership in the
RKHS.
  Motivated by the fact that the kernels and the approximants they generate are
smoother than required by the native space, this article extends the doubling
trick to error which measures higher smoothness. This extension holds for a
family of kernels satisfying easily checked hypotheses which we describe in
this article, and includes many prominent RBFs. In the course of the proof, new
convergence rates are obtained for the abstract operator considered by Devore

light. The visible-light channel includes a polarimeter with electro-optically
modulating Liquid Crystal Variable Retarders (LCVRs) to measure the linearly
polarized brightness of the K-corona to derive the electron density.
  Aims. In this paper, we present the first in-flight validation results of the
Metis polarimetric channel together with a comparison to the on-ground
calibrations. It is the validation of the first use in deep space (with hard
radiation environment) of an electro-optical device: a liquid crystal-based
polarimeter.
  Methods. We used the orientation of the K-corona's linear polarization vector
during the spacecraft roll maneuvers for the in-flight calibration.
  Results. The first in-flight validation of the Metis coronagraph on-board
Solar Orbiter shows a good agreement with the on-ground measurements. It
confirms the expected visible-light channel polarimetric performance. A final
comparison between the first pB obtained by Metis with the polarized brightness
(pB) obtained by the space-based coronagraph LASCO and the ground-based
coronagraph KCor shows the consistency of the Metis calibrated results.

(XRT) and Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations performed
near the predicted maximum and minimum phase of a single superorbital cycle for
each of these sources. The BAT dynamic power spectra show changes in the
strength of the superorbital modulation on timescales of years, with either the
peak at the fundamental frequency and/or the second harmonic present at
different times for all three sources. The pointed Swift XRT and NuSTAR
observations show no significant differences between the pulse profiles and
spectral parameters at the superorbital maximum and minimum phase. This is
likely due to the fact the superorbital modulation had weakened significantly

possible presence of multiple co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the
stellar winds of the supergiant stars, although a structured stellar wind from

methods, nearly all existing works implicitly assumed the existence of a
communication infrastructure that facilitates the direct communication between

however, does not hold in many real-world applications that can benefit from
distributed learning but lack a proper communication infrastructure (e.g.,

transporters adopt a synchronized or an asynchronized schedule. Even though the
indirect communications introduce heterogeneous delays to clients for both the
global model dissemination and the local model collection, we prove the
convergence of both versions of FedEx. The convergence analysis subsequently
sheds lights on how to assign clients to different transporters and design the
routes among the clients. The performance of FedEx is evaluated through

favour a perpendicular MCA at surfaces. A detailed analysis of various

the underlying physical mechanism is related to the metal-molecule interfacial

estimated from the orbital magnetic moment of the surface Co atoms, a
microscopic observable accessible to both theory and experiments. As such, we
suggest a way to directly assess the MCA modifications at molecule-decorated
surfaces, overcoming the limitations of experimental studies that rely on fits
of magnetization hysteresis loops. Finally, we also study the interface between
Co and both C$_{60}$ and Alq$_3$, two molecules that find widespread use in

in random trees. This new probabilistic result together with the previously

of fragments of defect soliton clusters with rooted tree configuration at

evolution of the unstable soliton clusters generated. Finally, based on

to reduce the tension between the measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$
from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and from the local cosmic distance
ladder. However, this model increases the $S_8$ tension between CMB and large
scale structure measurements. Analyses of galaxy clustering and lensing
correlation functions report a decreased preference for EDE and its effect on
the Hubble tension. Smooth dark energy models affect growth of structure
through the background expansion. In this work, we study the inclusion of a
general, smooth late-time dark energy modification in combination with EDE and
obtain constraints on EDE marginalized over the late-time expansion. We assess
the impact on the $S_8$ and Hubble tensions. In order to generalize the late
expansion, we use a late dark energy fluid model with a piecewise constant
equation of state $w(z)$ over 3, 5 and 10 redshift bins in the window $z \in
[0,3]$. We show that, when analyzing ACT and Planck CMB data combined with
Pantheon supernovae, BAO from 6dF, SDSS and BOSS, Planck 2018 CMB lensing and
Dark Energy Survey cosmic shear and clustering data, the inclusion of a general
smooth dark energy modification at late times has no significant effect on
$S_8$ and EDE parameter constraints. Using the aforementioned datasets, the EDE
fraction constraint with late-time expansion marginalization is $f_\mathrm{EDE}
= 0.067^{+0.019}_{-0.027}$ using 3 redshift bins, with similar results for 5

models for wind farm layout optimization, control, and annual energy
predictions. Although analytical wake models are widely used for these
applications, several model components must be better understood to improve
their accuracy. To this end, we propose a Bayesian uncertainty quantification
framework for physics-guided data-driven model enhancement. The framework
incorporates turbulence-related aleatoric uncertainty in historical wind farm
data, epistemic uncertainty in the empirical parameters, and systematic
uncertainty due to unmodelled physics. We apply the framework to the wake
expansion parameterization in the Gaussian wake model and employ historical
power data of the Westermost Rough offshore wind farm. We find that the
framework successfully distinguishes the three sources of uncertainty in the
joint posterior distribution of the parameters. On the one hand, the framework
allows for wake model calibration by selecting the maximum a posteriori
estimators for the empirical parameters. On the other hand, it facilitates
model validation by separating the measurement error and the model error
distribution. In addition, the model adequacy and the effect of unmodelled
physics are assessable via the posterior parameter uncertainty and
correlations. Consequently, we believe that the Bayesian uncertainty
quantification framework can be used to calibrate and validate existing and
upcoming physics-guided models.

suppression of the X-ray variability, we still observe UV/optical lags as
expected from disk reverberation. Moreover, the UV/optical lags are consistent
with archival observations when the X-ray luminosity was >10 times higher.
Interestingly, both low- and high-flux states reveal UV/optical lags that are
6-11 times longer than expected from a thin disk. These long lags are often
interpreted as due to contamination from the broad line region, however the u
band excess lag (containing the Balmer jump from the diffuse continuum) is less
prevalent than in other AGN. The Swift campaign showed a low X-ray-to-optical
correlation (similar to previous campaigns), but NICER and ground-based
monitoring continued for another two weeks, during which the optical rose to
the highest level of the campaign, followed ~10 days later by a sharp rise in
X-rays. While the low X-ray countrate and relatively large systematic
uncertainties in the NICER background make this measurement challenging, if the
optical does lead X-rays in this flare, this indicates a departure from the
zeroth-order reprocessing picture. If the optical flare is due to an increase
in mass accretion rate, this occurs on much shorter than the viscous timescale.
Alternatively, the optical could be responding to an intrinsic rise in X-rays
that is initially hidden from our line-of-sight.

between the sensory stream to multiple latent schemas and select the best
fitting one to guide behavior. To evaluate these graph schemas, we use two
previously published challenging tasks: the memory & planning game and one-shot
StreetLearn, that are designed to test rapid task solving in novel
environments. Graph schemas can be learned in far fewer episodes than previous
baselines, and can model and plan in a few steps in novel variations of these

navigation tasks in more challenging environments with aliased observations and
size variations, and show how different schemas can be composed to model larger

Reachability-based Signed Distance Functions (RDFs) as a neural implicit

these features enable its use within a novel real-time trajectory planning

almost exclusively on simple liquids composed of passive particles. Here we
consider a mixture of both passive and active (i.e.\ self-propelled) Brownian

Both methods accurately identify the active particles based on their structural

Voronoi method is, however, substantially faster to train and deploy because it
requires fewer, and easy to compute, input features. Notably, both become
ineffective when the activity is low, suggesting a fundamentally different
structural signature for dynamic propensity and non-equilibrium activity.
Ultimately, these efforts might also find relevance in the context of
biological active glasses such as confluent cell layers, where subtle changes
in the microstructure can hint at pathological changes in cell dynamics.

scales between the particle and the solvent, hence it is expected to break down
for diffusive transport on the molecular scale. However, a number of
experimental studies showed a remarkable small, if any, violation of this
equation down to the size of a nm, where there is no scale separation. To
resolve this puzzle we combine analytical ultracentrifugation experiments and
molecular dynamics simulations to study the transport of buckminsterfullerene
C$_{60}$ suspended in toluene at infinite dilution. We show that this system
clearly violates the conditions of slow momentum relaxation. Yet, through a
linear response to a constant force, we show both in experiments and in
simulations that the SES equation can be recovered in the long time limit with
no more than 4% uncertainty. This nonetheless requires partial slip on the
particle interface, extracted consistently from all the data. Our results,
thus, resolve a long-standing discussion on the validity and limits of the SES

importance of the magnetic field for understanding observed dynamics means that
interactions between charged and neutral particles play a very important role

between fluids, essential for the neutral fluid to effectively feel the Lorentz

interactions to the dynamic timescale determines whether a single-fluid model
or, when the dynamic frequency is higher, the more detailed two-fluid model is
the more appropriate. However, as many MHD phenomena fundamentally contain

an important physical contribution from two-fluid processes. In this review we
will focus on two-fluid models, looking in detail at two areas where the

can easily develop: shock-waves and instabilities. We then connect these ideas

gas/plasma through Kelvin-Helmholtz-instability-driven turbulence leads to the
formation of an intermediate temperature phase with increased radiative losses
that drive efficient cooling. The solar atmosphere is a potential site for this
process to occur with interaction between either prominence or spicule material
and the solar corona allowing the development of transition region material
with enhanced radiative losses. In this paper, we derive a set of equations to
model the evolution of such a mixing layer and make predictions for the
mixing-driven cooling rate and the rate at which mixing can lead to the
condensation of the coronal material. These theoretical predictions are
benchmarked against 2.5D MHD simulations. Applying the theoretical scalings to
prominence threads or fading spicules, we found that as a mixing layer grows on
their boundaries this would lead to the creation of transition region material
with a cooling time of ~100 s, explaining the warm emission observed as
prominence threads or spicules fade in cool spectral lines without the
requirement for any heating. For quiescent prominences, dynamic condensation
driven by the mixing process could restore ~18 per cent of the mass lost from a
prominence through downflows. Overall, this mechanism of thermal energy loss
through radiative losses induced by mixing highlights the importance for
considering dynamical interaction between material at different temperatures

ancillary data available in each observed field (including X-ray coverage,
multi-narrow-band photometry and spectroscopic redshift information) will
provide an environmental characterisation for each observed galaxy. This paper
presents the science case of WEAVE-StePS, the fields to be observed, the parent
catalogues used to define the target sample, and the observing strategy chosen
after a forecast of the expected performance of the instrument for our typical
targets. WEAVE-StePS will go back further in cosmic time than SDSS, extending
its reach to encompass more than ~6 Gyr, nearly half of the age of the
Universe. The spectral and redshift range covered by WEAVE-StePS will open a
new observational window by continuously tracing the evolutionary path of
galaxies in the largely unexplored intermediate-redshift range.

each demographic group while also leveraging shared properties across groups.
With toxicity detection, each task corresponds to identifying toxicity against
a particular demographic group. However, traditional MTL requires labels for
all tasks to be present for every data point. To address this, we propose
Conditional MTL (CondMTL), wherein only training examples relevant to the given
demographic group are considered by the loss function. This lets us learn group
specific representations in each branch which are not cross contaminated by

probe the dust-to-gas ratio across 2.5 orders of magnitude in ISM surface
density. We find significant evolution in the dust-to-gas ratio, with
dust-to-gas varying with density within each galaxy by up to a factor 22.4. We
explore several possible reasons for this, and our favored explanation is dust
grain growth in denser regions of ISM. We find that the evolution of the
dust-to-gas ratio with ISM surface density is very similar between M31 and M33,
despite their large differences in mass, metallicity, and star formation rate;
conversely, we find M33 and the LMC to have very different dust-to-gas
evolution profiles, despite their close similarity in those properties. Our
dust-to-gas ratios address previous disagreement between UV- and FIR-based
dust-to-gas estimates for the Magellanic Clouds, removing the disagreement for
the LMC, and considerably reducing it for the SMC - with our new dust-to-gas
measurements being factors of 2.4 and 2.0 greater than the previous
far-infrared estimates, respectively. We also observe that the dust-to-gas
ratio appears to fall at the highest densities for the LMC, M31, and M33; this

connections to many mathematical and applied pursuits including operator
theory, quantum information, noncommutative optimization, and linear control
systems. In the setting of classical convex sets, extreme points are central
objects which exhibit many important properties. For example, the Minkowski
theorem shows that any element of a closed bounded convex set can be expressed
as a convex combination of extreme points. Extreme points are also of great
interest in the dimension free setting of matrix convex sets; however, here the
situation requires more nuance.
  In the dimension free setting, there are many different types of extreme
points. Of particular importance are free extreme points, a highly restricted
type of extreme point that is closely connected to the dilation theoretic
Arveson boundary. If free extreme points span a matrix convex set through
matrix convex combinations, then they satisfy a strong notion of minimality in
doing so. However, not all closed bounded matrix convex sets even have free
extreme points. Thus, a major goal is to determine which matrix convex sets are
spanned by their free extreme points.
  Building on a recent work of J. W. Helton and the author which shows that
free spectrahedra, i.e., dimension free solution sets to linear matrix
inequalities, are spanned by their free extreme points, we establish two
additional classes of matrix convex sets which are the matrix convex hull of
their free extreme points. Namely, we show that closed bounded free
spectrahedrops, i.e, closed bounded projections of free spectrahedra, are the
span of their free extreme points. Furthermore, we show that if one considers
linear operator inequalities that have compact operator defining tuples, then
the resulting ``generalized"" free spectrahedra are spanned by their free
extreme points.

reparametrization from the perspective of Riemannian geometry. From this point
of view, invariance is an inherent property of any neural net if one explicitly
represents the metric and uses the correct associated transformation rules.
This is important since although the metric is always present, it is often

gradients via bending and rippling. Moreover, strain gradients break inversion
symmetry to activate polar distortions, ferroelectricity, chiral spin textures,
novel superconductivity, and topological states. Recent advances in membrane
synthesis by remote epitaxy and sacrificial etch layers enable extreme strains
in new materials, including transition metal oxides and Heusler compounds,
compared to natively van der Waals (vdW) materials like graphene. We highlight
new opportunities and challenges for strain and strain gradient engineering in
membranes of non-vdW materials.

Semiconducting properties of a nanoparticle are modeled by a surface charge

pressure on the appearance of polarization switching in CuInP2S6 nanoparticles,
hysteresis loops shape, magnitude of the remanent polarization, and coercive
fields, and explain the effects by the anomalous temperature dependence and
""inverted"" signs of CuInP2S6 linear and nonlinear electrostriction coupling
coefficients. In particular, by varying the sign of the applied pressure (from
tension to compression) and its magnitude (from zero to several hundreds of
MPa), quasi-static hysteresis-less paraelectric curves can transform into
double, triple, pinched, or single hysteresis loops. Due to the sufficiently
wide temperature and pressure ranges of double, triple, and pinched hysteresis
loop stability (at least in comparison with many other ferroelectrics),
CuInP2S6 nanodisks can be of particular interest for applications in energy
storage (in the region of double loops), CuInP2S6 nanospheres maybe suitable
for dynamic random access multibit memory, and CuInP2S6 nanoneedles are
promising for non-volatile multibit memory cells (in the regions of triple and

allows the creation of advanced piezo-sensors based on CuInP2S6 nanocomposites.

the hard tasks. Therefore, we first extend the model to allow worker accuracy

algorithm (i.e., any algorithm designed for the Dawid-Skene model) can be
applied independently to each type to infer the truth values. We theoretically
prove that when crowdsourced data contain tasks with varying levels of

from the source with Swift-BAT on 2022 April 7, observations by NICER detected
an increased flux peaking at $(6.0 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$
cm$^{-2}$ in the soft X-ray band, falling to the baseline level of
$1.7\times10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ over a 17-day period. Joint
spectroscopic measurements by NICER and NuSTAR indicated no change in the hard
non-thermal tail despite the prominent increase in soft X-rays. Observations at
radio wavelengths with Murriyang, the 64-m Parkes radio telescope, revealed
that the persistent radio emission from the magnetar disappeared at least 22
days prior to the initial Swift-BAT detection and was re-detected two weeks
later. Such behavior is unprecedented in a radio-loud magnetar, and may point
to an unnoticed slow rise in the high-energy activity prior to the detected
short-bursts. Finally, our combined radio and X-ray timing revealed the
outburst coincided with a spin-up glitch, where the spin-frequency and
spin-down rate increased by $0.2 \pm 0.1$ $\mu$Hz and $(-2.4 \pm 0.1) \times

associated with a reconfiguration of the quasi-polar field lines, likely
signalling a changing twist, accompanied by spatially broader heating of the
surface and a brief quenching of the radio signal, yet without any measurable

modeling. They consist of a forward process that perturbs input data with

mostly formulated on finite-dimensional spaces, e.g. Euclidean, limiting their
applications to many domains where the data has a functional form such as in
scientific computing and 3D geometric data analysis. In this work, we introduce
a mathematically rigorous framework called Denoising Diffusion Operators (DDOs)

perturbs input functions gradually using a Gaussian process. The generative
process is formulated by integrating a function-valued Langevin dynamic. Our
approach requires an appropriate notion of the score for the perturbed data
distribution, which we obtain by generalizing denoising score matching to
function spaces that can be infinite-dimensional. We show that the
corresponding discretized algorithm generates accurate samples at a fixed cost
that is independent of the data resolution. We theoretically and numerically
verify the applicability of our approach on a set of problems, including
generating solutions to the Navier-Stokes equation viewed as the push-forward

to their out-of-the-box performance and interpretability. Often, Decision Trees
models are constructed greedily in a top-down fashion via heuristic search
criteria, such as Gini impurity or entropy. However, trees constructed in this
manner are sensitive to minor fluctuations in training data and are prone to
overfitting. In contrast, Bayesian approaches to tree construction formulate
the selection process as a posterior inference problem; such approaches are
more stable and provide greater theoretical guarantees. However, generating
Bayesian Decision Trees usually requires sampling from complex, multimodal
posterior distributions. Current Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based approaches for
sampling Bayesian Decision Trees are prone to mode collapse and long mixing
times, which makes them impractical. In this paper, we propose a new criterion
for training Bayesian Decision Trees. Our criterion gives rise to BCART-PCFG,
which can efficiently sample decision trees from a posterior distribution
across trees given the data and find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) tree.
Learning the posterior and training the sampler can be done in time that is
polynomial in the dataset size. Once the posterior has been learned, trees can
be sampled efficiently (linearly in the number of nodes). At the core of our
method is a reduction of sampling the posterior to sampling a derivation from a
probabilistic context-free grammar. We find that trees sampled via BCART-PCFG
perform comparable to or better than greedily-constructed Decision Trees in
classification accuracy on several datasets. Additionally, the trees sampled
via BCART-PCFG are significantly smaller -- sometimes by as much as 20x.

pose-oriented self-attention mechanism and distance-related position embedding
for POT to explicitly exploit the human skeleton topology. The pose-oriented
self-attention mechanism explicitly models the topological interactions between

distance of joints to the root joint to distinguish groups of joints with
different difficulties in regression. Furthermore, we present an
Uncertainty-Guided Refinement Network (UGRN) to refine pose predictions from
POT, especially for the difficult joints, by considering the estimated
uncertainty of each joint with uncertainty-guided sampling strategy and

interaction between customers in a service facility. Most of the previous
analysis relies on the single jump assumption for arrivals, which implies the
queue increases by one for each arrival epoch. In this paper, we relax the
single arrival assumption and explore the impact of having batch arrivals.
Unfortunately, with batch arrivals it is not clear how one measures an overlap

schemes perform multiple rounds of confusion and diffusion to protect the image
against attacks. Such operations, however, are time-consuming, cannot meet the
real-time requirements of video encryption. Existing works, therefore, realize
video encryption by simplifying the encryption process or encrypting specific
parts of video frames, which results in lower security compared to image
encryption. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a real-time chaotic video
encryption strategy based on multithreaded parallel confusion and diffusion. It
takes a video as the input, splits the frame into subframes, creates a set of
threads to simultaneously perform five rounds of confusion and diffusion
operations on corresponding subframes, and efficiently outputs the encrypted
frames. The encryption speed evaluation shows that our method significantly
improves the confusion and diffusion speed, realizes real-time 480x480,
576x576, and 768x768 24FPS video encryption using Intel Core i5-1135G7, Intel
Core i7-8700, and Intel Xeon Gold 6226R, respectively. The statistical and
security analysis prove that the deployed cryptosystems have outstanding
statistical properties, can resist attacks, channel noise, and data loss.
Compared with existing works, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed
strategy achieves the fastest encryption speed, and realizes the first
real-time chaotic video encryption that reaches the security level of image
encryption. In addition, it is suitable for many confusion, diffusion
algorithms and can be easily deployed with both hardware and software.

between the strong $E0$ transition strength and the occurrence of shape

mechanics approach called the teacher-student setting. We consider an ensemble
of student machines that exactly reproduce $M$ sets of $N$ dimensional
input/output relations provided by a teacher machine. We analyze the ensemble
theoretically using a replica method (H. Yoshino (2020)) and numerically
performing greedy Monte Carlo simulations. The replica theory which works on
high dimensional data $N \gg 1$ becomes exact in 'dense limit' $N \gg c \gg 1$
and $M \gg 1$ with fixed $\alpha=M/c$. Both the theory and the simulation
suggest learning by the DNN is quite heterogeneous in the network space:
configurations of the machines are more correlated within the layers closer to
the input/output boundaries while the central region remains much less
correlated due to over-parametrization. Deep enough systems relax faster thanks
to the less correlated central region. Remarkably both the theory and
simulation suggest generalization-ability of the student machines does not
vanish even in the deep limit $L \gg 1$ where the system becomes strongly
over-parametrized. We also consider the impact of effective dimension $D(\leq

dense limit, which reflect correlations between different nodes in the network,
become enhanced by either decreasing the width $\ N$ or decreasing the

supply chain that predicts delivery time based on merchant information, sending
address, receiving address, and payment time. Accurate DTE can boost platform
revenue and reduce customer complaints and refunds. However, the imbalanced
nature of industrial data impedes previous models from reaching satisfactory
prediction performance. Although imbalanced regression methods can be applied
to the DTE task, we experimentally find that they improve the prediction
performance of low-shot data samples at the sacrifice of overall performance.
To address the issue, we propose a novel Dual Graph Multitask framework for
imbalanced Delivery Time Estimation (DGM-DTE). Our framework first classifies
package delivery time as head and tail data. Then, a dual graph-based model is
utilized to learn representations of the two categories of data. In particular,
DGM-DTE re-weights the embedding of tail data by estimating its kernel density.
We fuse two graph-based representations to capture both high- and low-shot data
representations. Experiments on real-world Taobao logistics datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of DGM-DTE compared to baselines.

the phase space is a principal fiber bundle, i.e., a base, or shape manifold
$\mathcal{B}$, and fibers $\mathcal{F}$ along the symmetry direction attached
to it. The symplectic structure of the Hamiltonian dynamics determines the
connection and curvature forms of the shape manifold. Using Cartan's structural
equations with zero torsion we find an intrinsic (pseudo) Riemannian metric for
the shape manifold. For a double pendulum the metric is pseudo-Riemannian if
the total angular momentum $\mathsf{A}<0$, and the shape manifold is an
expanding spacetime with the Robertson-Walker metric and positive curvature.
For $\mathsf{A}>0$, the shape manifold is the hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{H}^2$
with negative curvature. We then generalize our results to free $N$-pendula. We
show that the associated shape manifold~$\mathcal{B}$ is reducible to the
product manifold of $(N-1)$ hyperbolic planes $\mathbb{H}^2$~($\mathsf{A}>0$),
or Robertson-Walker $2$D spacetimes~($\mathsf{A}<0$). We then consider
$N$-pendula subject to time-dependent self-equilibrated moments. The extended

product space of $N$ hyperbolic planes $\mathbb{H}^2$~($\mathsf{A}>0$), or
Robertson-Walker $2$D spacetimes~($\mathsf{A}<0$). In either case, the
geometric phase follows by integrating a $2$-form given by the sum of the
sectional curvature forms of $\mathcal{B}$. The Riemannian structure of the

another in terms of curvature, or induced geometric phase.

federated learning (PFL) has achieved great success in handling Non-IID data by
enforcing regularization in local optimization or improving the model
aggregation scheme on the server. However, most of the PFL approaches do not
take into account the unfair competition issue caused by the imbalanced data
distribution and lack of positive samples for some classes in each client. To
address this issue, we propose a novel and generic PFL framework termed
Federated Averaging via Binary Classification, dubbed FedABC. In particular, we
adopt the ``one-vs-all'' training strategy in each client to alleviate the
unfair competition between classes by constructing a personalized binary
classification problem for each class. This may aggravate the class imbalance
challenge and thus a novel personalized binary classification loss that
incorporates both the under-sampling and hard sample mining strategies is
designed. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular datasets under
different settings, and the results demonstrate that our FedABC can
significantly outperform the existing counterparts.

present a general scheme to classify possible gapless vortex-line phases in
superconducting Dirac semimetals with rotation (or screw) symmetry and
inversion symmetry, assuming that the rotation (screw) axis is parallel to the
vortex line. The rotation (screw)-symmetry-protected gapless modes are stable
as long as they have different rotation (screw) eigenvalues. The underlying
mechanism for the formation of gapless vortex bound states depends on
irreducible representations of rotation (screw) symmetry subject to a vortex
field and is classified into three types: (i) accidental band crossing of two
vortex bound-state modes under rotation symmetry; (ii) accidental and (iii)
enforced band crossing of four vortex bound-state modes under screw symmetry.
We present a tight-binding model of screw-symmetry-protected Dirac semimetal

points (Majorana zero modes) pinned at a time-reversal invariant momentum
(TRIM) when the Fermi energy is close to the Dirac points. As the Fermi energy
is moved away from the Dirac points, the four gapless modes are split into a
pair of two gapless modes with vanishing excitation energy at non-TRIMs. In
closing, we discuss Nb$_3$Pt as a candidate material with the four-fold
screw-symmetry-protected Dirac cones that can host a gapless vortex-line phase.

poses at any time instants corresponding to the sensor measurements. To bound
the computation complexity of the continuous-time fixed-lag smoother, we
maintain temporal and keyframe sliding windows with constant size, and
probabilistically marginalize out control points of the trajectory and other

tightly-coupled multi-modal SLAM algorithms with a variety of sensor
combinations, like the LiDAR-inertial and LiDAR-inertial-camera SLAM systems,

address this issue, here we present CUTS, a neural Granger causal discovery
algorithm to jointly impute unobserved data points and build causal graphs, via

builds a causal adjacency matrix with imputed data under sparse penalty.
Experiments show that CUTS effectively infers causal graphs from unstructured
time-series data, with significantly superior performance to existing methods.
Our approach constitutes a promising step towards applying causal discovery to
real applications with non-ideal observations.

direct calculation of gradients of the energy via the Hellmann-Feynman theorem.
A planewave basis with norm-conserving pseudopotentials is used for the study
of periodic bulk materials. Completeness of the planewave basis minimizes the
effect of so-called Pulay terms. The ionic pseudopotentials, which can be
incorporated in AFQMC in exactly the same manner as in standard
independent-electron methods, regulate the force and stress estimators and
eliminate any potential divergence of the Monte Carlo variances. The resulting
approach allows applications of full geometry optimizations in bulk materials.
It also paves the way for many-body computations of the phonon spectrum in
solids.

are not simply devices for making phone calls and receiving SMS messages, but
powerful communication and entertainment platforms for web surfing, social
networking, etc. Even though the Android OS offers powerful communication and
application execution capabilities, it is riddled with defects (e.g., security
risks, and compatibility issues), new vulnerabilities come to light daily, and
bugs cost the economy tens of billions of dollars annually. For example,
malicious apps (e.g., back-doors, fraud apps, ransomware, spyware, etc.) are
reported [Google, 2022] to exhibit malicious behaviours, including privacy
stealing, unwanted programs installed, etc. To counteract these threats, many
works have been proposed that rely on static analysis techniques to detect such
issues. However, static techniques are not sufficient on their own to detect
such defects precisely. This will likely yield false positive results as static
analysis has to make some trade-offs when handling complicated cases (e.g.,
object-sensitive vs. object-insensitive). In addition, static analysis
techniques will also likely suffer from soundness issues because some
complicated features (e.g., reflection, obfuscation, and hardening) are
difficult to be handled [Sun et al., 2021b, Samhi et al., 2022].

study the limitations of the calibration in the presence of diurnal gain

we present a new communication-efficient algorithm that offers the synergistic
benefits of both sparsification and sign quantization, called ${\sf S}^3$GD-MV.
The workers in ${\sf S}^3$GD-MV select the top-$K$ magnitude components of
their local gradient vector and only send the signs of these components to the

majority vote rule. Our analysis shows that, under certain mild conditions,
${\sf S}^3$GD-MV can converge at the same rate as signSGD while significantly
reducing communication costs, if the sparsification parameter $K$ is properly
chosen based on the number of workers and the size of the deep learning model.
Experimental results using both independent and identically distributed (IID)

accuracy than signSGD, significantly reducing communication costs. These
findings highlight the potential of ${\sf S}^3$GD-MV as a promising solution

Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to determine the turnover scale
in a model-independent fashion statistically. We avoid modelling the BAO by
down-weighting affected scales in the covariance matrix using the mode
deprojection technique. We measure the wavenumber of the peak to be
$k_\mathrm{TO} = \left( 17.7^{+1.9}_{-1.7} \right) \times

current BAO distance measures in terms of determining the expansion history but
does provide a useful cross-check. We combine this measurement with
low-redshift distance measurements from type-Ia supernova data from Pantheon

graph-based tasks along with dynamic information, which has recently drawn
increasing attention. Unlike the static graph, a temporal graph is usually
organized in the form of node interaction sequences over continuous time
instead of an adjacency matrix. Most temporal graph learning methods model
current interactions by combining historical information over time. However,
such methods merely consider the first-order temporal information while
ignoring the important high-order structural information, leading to
sub-optimal performance. To solve this issue, by extracting both temporal and
structural information to learn more informative node representations, we
propose a self-supervised method termed S2T for temporal graph learning. Note
that the first-order temporal information and the high-order structural
information are combined in different ways by the initial node representations
to calculate two conditional intensities, respectively. Then the alignment loss
is introduced to optimize the node representations to be more informative by
narrowing the gap between the two intensities. Concretely, besides modeling
temporal information using historical neighbor sequences, we further consider
the structural information from both local and global levels. At the local
level, we generate structural intensity by aggregating features from the
high-order neighbor sequences. At the global level, a global representation is
generated based on all nodes to adjust the structural intensity according to
the active statuses on different nodes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method S2T achieves at most 10.13% performance improvement
compared with the state-of-the-art competitors on several datasets.

organizations(e.g., financial or medical entities) to train global models on
isolated data. Reasonable incentive is key to encouraging organizations to
contribute data. However, existing works on incentivizing cross-silo FL lack
consideration of the environmental dynamics (e.g., precision of the trained
global model and data owned by uncertain clients during the training
processes). Moreover, most of them assume that organizations share private
information, which is unrealistic. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
novel adaptive mechanism for cross-silo FL, towards incentivizing organizations
to contribute data to maximize their long-term payoffs in a real dynamic
training environment. The mechanism is based on multi-agent reinforcement
learning, which learns near-optimal data contribution strategy from the history
of potential games without organizations' private information. Experiments
demonstrate that our mechanism achieves adaptive incentive and effectively
improves the long-term payoffs for organizations.

radio galaxies in the 0.5--2 keV band in the eFEDS field covering 140~deg$^2$.
Thanks to the wide and medium depth eFEDS X-ray survey, the sample contains the
rare and most X-ray luminous radio galaxies above the knee of the X-ray
luminosity function, spanning 44<log L(0.5-2keV,abs)<46.5 at $1<z<4$. Based on
the X-ray properties obtained by the spectral fitting, 37 sources show obscured
AGN signature with $\log (N_\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2})>22$. Those obscured
and radio AGN reside in $0.4<z<3.2$, indicating that they are obscured
counterparts of the radio-loud quasar, which are missed in the previous optical
quasar surveys. By combining radio and X-ray luminosities, the jet production
efficiency $\eta_\mathrm{jet}$ is investigated, and we find 14 sources with
extremely high jet production efficiency at $\eta_\mathrm{jet}\approx1$. This
high $\eta_\mathrm{jet}$ value might be a result of 1) the decreased radiation
efficiency of $\eta_\mathrm{rad}<0.1$ due to the low accretion rate for those
sources and/or 2) the boosting due to the decline of $L_\mathrm{bol}$ by a
factor of 10--100 by keeping $P_\mathrm{jet}$ constant in the previous Myr,
indicating the experience of the AGN feedback. Finally, inferring the BH masses
from the stellar-mass, we find that X-ray luminous sources show the excess of
the radio emission with respect to the value estimated from the fundamental
plane. Such radio emission excess cannot be explained by the Doppler booming
alone, and therefore disk-jet connection of X-ray luminous eFEDS-WERGS is
fundamentally different from the conventional fundamental plane which mainly
covers low accretion regime.

Network, and Spitzer telescopes. The event is caused by a giant source star in
the Galactic Bulge passing over a large resonant binary lens caustic. The
availability of space-based data allows the full set of physical parameters to
be calculated. However, there exists an eightfold degeneracy in the parallax
measurement. The four best solutions correspond to very-low-mass binaries near
($M_1 = 170^{+40}_{-50} M_J$ and $M_2 = 110^{+20}_{-30} M_J$), or well below
($M_1 = 22.5^{+0.7}_{-0.4} M_J$ and $M_2 = 13.3^{+0.4}_{-0.3} M_J$) the
boundary between stars and brown dwarfs. A conventional analysis, with scaled
uncertainties for Spitzer data, implies a very-low-mass brown dwarf binary lens
at a distance of 2 kpc. Compensating for systematic Spitzer errors using a
Gaussian process model suggests that a higher mass M-dwarf binary at 6 kpc is
equally likely. A Bayesian comparison based on a galactic model favors the
larger-mass solutions. We demonstrate how this degeneracy can be resolved
within the next ten years through infrared adaptive-optics imaging with a 40 m

reflectivity target, where the error probability decays exponentially in the
number of copies used. When the target reflectivity is small so that it is hard
to distinguish target presence or absence, the exponential decay constant falls
into a class of objects called monotone metrics. We evaluate monotone metrics
restricted to Gaussian states in terms of first-order moments and covariance
matrix. Under the assumption of a low reflectivity target, we explicitly derive
analytic formulae for decay constant of an arbitrary Gaussian input state.
Especially, in the limit of large background noise and low reflectivity, there
is no need of symplectic diagonalization which usually complicates the
computation of decay constants. First, we show that two-mode squeezed vacuum
(TMSV) states are the optimal probe among pure Gaussian states with fixed
signal mean photon number. Second, as an alternative to preparing TMSV states
with high mean photon number, we show that preparing a TMSV state with low mean
photon number and displacing the signal mode is a more experimentally feasible
setup without degrading the performance that much. Third, we show that it is of
utmost importance to prepare an efficient idler memory to beat coherent states
and provide analytic bounds on the idler memory transmittivity in terms of
signal power, background noise, and idler memory noise. Finally, we identify
the region of physically possible correlations between the signal and idler
modes that can beat coherent states.

dependence of its phase modulation on the incoming wave angle. The differences

star-forming site IC 5146 dark Streamer (d $\sim$600 pc), which has been
treated as a single and long filament, fl. Two hub-filament systems (HFSs) are
known toward the eastern and the western ends of fl. Earlier published results
favor the simultaneous evidence of HFSs and the end-dominated collapse (EDC) in
fl. Herschel column density map (resolution $\sim$13$''$.5) reveals two
intertwined sub-filaments (i.e., fl-A and fl-B) toward fl, displaying a nearly
double helix-like structure. This picture is also supported by the
C$^{18}$O(3-2) emission. The scenario ""fray and fragment"" may explain the
origin of intertwined sub-filaments. In the direction of fl, two cloud
components around 2 and 4 km s$^{-1}$ are depicted using the $^{13}$CO(1-0) and
C$^{18}$O(1-0) emission, and are connected in velocity space. The HFSs are
spatially found at the overlapping areas of these cloud components and can be
explained by the cloud-cloud collision scenario. Non-thermal gas motion in fl
with larger Mach number is found. The magnetic field position angle measured
from the filament's long axis shows a linear trend along the filament. This
signature is confirmed in the other nearby EDC filaments, presenting a more
quantitative confirmation of the EDC scenario. Based on our observational
outcomes, we witness multiple processes operational in IC 5146 Streamer.
Overall, the Streamer can be recognized as the first reliable candidate of edge

remarkable ability of this approach to handle complex scatterer geometries

convergence of the DNN predictions to a physically consistent inverse design.

based on a stochastic gradient decent concept. Moreover, an appropriate step
size normalization for the update of the tensors and the LMS supports the

exacerbated by data selection, is addressed by modelling the SD parameter
uncertainty using Bayesian learning. Experiments on the benchmark 300-hour

nucleus of each dopant strongly couples to the electron spin, leading to many
controllable quantum levels and the emergence of atomic clock-like transitions
that are well protected from environmental noise. Specifically, the Hanh-echo
coherence time increases beyond seconds at the clock-like transition in the
defect with $^{209}$Bi. Our results pave the way to designing quantum states
with long coherence times in simple oxides, making them attractive platforms
for quantum technologies.

  Imputation Network",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  With the development of various applications, such as social networks and
knowledge graphs, graph data has been ubiquitous in the real world.
Unfortunately, graphs usually suffer from being absent due to
privacy-protecting policies or copyright restrictions during data collection.
The absence of graph data can be roughly categorized into attribute-incomplete
and attribute-missing circumstances. Specifically, attribute-incomplete
indicates that a part of the attribute vectors of all nodes are incomplete,
while attribute-missing indicates that the whole attribute vectors of partial
nodes are missing. Although many efforts have been devoted, none of them is
custom-designed for a common situation where both types of graph data absence
exist simultaneously. To fill this gap, we develop a novel network termed
Revisiting Initializing Then Refining (RITR), where we complete both
attribute-incomplete and attribute-missing samples under the guidance of a
novel initializing-then-refining imputation criterion. Specifically, to
complete attribute-incomplete samples, we first initialize the incomplete
attributes using Gaussian noise before network learning, and then introduce a
structure-attribute consistency constraint to refine incomplete values by
approximating a structure-attribute correlation matrix to a high-order
structural matrix. To complete attribute-missing samples, we first adopt
structure embeddings of attribute-missing samples as the embedding
initialization, and then refine these initial values by adaptively aggregating
the reliable information of attribute-incomplete samples according to a dynamic
affinity structure. To the best of our knowledge, this newly designed method is
the first unsupervised framework dedicated to handling hybrid-absent graphs.
Extensive experiments on four datasets have verified that our methods
consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art competitors.

range when positioned in room edges, therefore they are a common method for
reducing low-frequency reverberation. However, standard room acoustic
simulation methods such as ray tracing and mirror sources are invalid for low
frequencies in general which is a consequence of using geometrical methods,
yielding a lack of simulation tools for these so-called edge absorbers. In this
article, a validated finite element simulation model is presented, which is
able to predict the effect of an edge absorber on the acoustic field. With this
model, the interaction mechanisms between room and absorber can be studied by
high-resolved acoustic field visualizations in both room and absorber. The
finite element model is validated against transfer function data computed from
impulse response measurements in a reverberation chamber in style of ISO 354.
The absorber made of Basotect is modeled using the
Johnson-Champoux-Allard-Lafarge model, which is fitted to impedance tube
measurements using the four-microphone transfer matrix method. It is shown that
the finite element simulation model is able to predict the influence of
different edge absorber configurations on the measured transfer functions to a
high degree of accuracy. The evaluated third-octave band error exhibits
deviations of 3.25dB to 4.11dB computed from third-octave band averaged

its simplicity and attractive statistical properties. However, the vanilla
version of bootstrap is no longer feasible computationally for many modern

Therefore, several improvements to the bootstrap method have been made in
recent years, which assess the quality of estimators by subsampling the full
dataset before resampling the subsamples. Naturally, the performance of these
modern subsampling methods is influenced by tuning parameters such as the size
of subsamples, the number of subsamples, and the number of resamples per
subsample. In this paper, we develop a novel hyperparameter selection
methodology for selecting these tuning parameters. Formulated as an
optimization problem to find the optimal value of some measure of accuracy of
an estimator subject to computational cost, our framework provides closed-form
solutions for the optimal hyperparameter values for subsampled bootstrap,
subsampled double bootstrap and bag of little bootstraps, at no or little extra

apply our methodology to study, compare and improve the performance of these

class of thermal relaxation laws in the modeling of sound wave propagation. In
this work, we analyze initial boundary value problems for a family of such
equations and determine the behavior of solutions as the relaxation time
vanishes. In particular, we allow the leading term to be of fractional type.
The studied model can be viewed as a generalization of the well-established
(fractional) Moore--Gibson--Thompson equation with three, in general nonlocal,
convolution terms involving two different kernels. The interplay of these
convolutions will influence the uniform analysis and the limiting procedure. To
unify the theoretical treatment of this class of local and nonlocal
higher-order equations, we relax the classical assumption on the leading-term
kernel and consider it to be a Radon measure. After establishing uniform
well-posedness with respect to the relaxation time of the considered general
model, we connect it, through a delicate singular limit procedure, to
fractional second-order models of linear acoustics.

curates over 400K Matched Molecular Pairs (MMPs) against 190 targets, including
over 20K MMP-cliffs and 380K non-AC MMPs, and provides five subsets for model

the predictive performance of molecular representations encoded by deep neural

experimental results show that deep learning models can achieve good
performance when the models are trained on tasks with adequate amount of data,

addition, the traditional ECFP method shows a natural advantage on MMP-cliff

breakdown mechanism observed in traditional band insulators. Our new mechanism
results from the instability of the many-body ground state for exciton
condensation, caused by the strong competition between the polarization and
condensation energies in the presence of an electric field. We refer to this
mechanism as ``many-body breakdown''. To investigate this new mechanism, we
propose a BCS-type trial wave function under finite electric fields and use it
to study the many-body breakdown numerically. Our results reveal two different
types of electric breakdown behavior. If the system size is larger than a
critical value, the Zener tunneling process is first turned on when an
electrical field is applied, but the excitonic gap remains until the field
strength reaches the critical value of the many-body breakdown, after which the
excitonic gap disappears and the system becomes a highly conductive metallic
state. However, if the system size is much smaller than the critical value, the
intermediate tunneling phase disappears since the many-body breakdown happens
before the onset of Zener tunneling. The sudden disappearance of the local gap
leads to an ``off-on'' feature in the current-voltage ($I-V$) curve, providing
a straightforward way to distinguish excitonic insulators from normal
insulators.

i$^2$Piano, exploits large steps by adjusting a local Lipschitz constant. The
second algorithm, iPila, overcomes the main drawback of line-search based
methods by enforcing a descent only on a merit function instead of the

limit. In the microwave region this corresponds to energies in the yJ range.
This extreme sensitivity has to be combined with an extremely low dark count
rate, since the probability of axions conversion into microwave photons is
supposed to be very low. To face this complicated task, we followed two
promising approaches that both rely on the use of superconducting devices based
on the Josephson effect. The first one is to use a single Josephson junction
(JJ) as a switching detector (i.e. exploiting the superconducting to normal
state transition in presence of microwave photons). We designed a device
composed of a coplanar waveguide terminated on a current biased Josephson
junction. We tested its efficiency to pulsed (pulse duration 10 ns) microwave
signals, since this configuration is closer to an actual axions search
experiment. We show how our device is able to reach detection capability of the

intrinsically quantum device formed by two resonators coupled only via a
superconducting qubit network (SQN). This approach relies on quantum
nondemolition measurements of the resonator photons. We show that injecting RF
power into the resonator, the frequency position of the resonant drop in the

that, once optimized, both the devices have the potential to reach single
photon sensitivity.

trained to emulate solutions of differential equations without the necessity of
solution data. They are currently ubiquitous in the scientific literature due
to their flexible and promising settings. However, very little of the available
research provides practical studies that aim for a better quantitative
understanding of such architecture and its functioning. In this paper, we
analyze the performance of PINNs for various architectural hyperparameters and
algorithmic settings based on a novel error metric and other factors such as
training time. The proposed metric and approach are tailored to evaluate how
well a PINN generalizes to points outside its training domain. Besides, we
investigate the effect of the algorithmic setup on the outcome prediction of a
PINN, inside and outside its training domain, to explore the effect of each
hyperparameter. Through our study, we assess how the algorithmic setup of PINNs
influences their potential for generalization and deduce the settings which
maximize the potential of a PINN for accurate generalization. The study that we
present returns insightful and at times counterintuitive results on PINNs.
These results can be useful in PINN applications when defining the model and
evaluating it.

extended state-space and multi-step methods. The paper focuses on lattice
Boltzmann schemes, which can be interpreted as examples of both previous
categories of numerical schemes. We propose a modified equation analysis of the
initialisation schemes for lattice Boltzmann methods, determined by the choice
of initial data. These modified equations provide guidelines to devise and
analyze the initialisation in terms of order of consistency with respect to the
target Cauchy problem and time smoothness of the numericalsolution. In detail,
the larger the number of matched terms between modified equations for
initialisation and bulk methods, the smoother the obtained numerical solution.
This is particularly manifest for numerical dissipation. Starting from the
constraints to achieve time smoothness, which can quickly become prohibitive,
we explain how the distinct lack of observability for certain lattice Boltzmann
schemes -- seen as dynamical systems on a commutative ring -- can yield rather
simple conditions and be easily studied as far as their initialisation is
concerned. This comes from the reduced numberof initialisation schemes at the
fully discrete level. These theoretical results are successfully assessed on
several lattice Boltzmann methods.

the fact that bird sounds are weakly labelled: a species name is attributed to
each audio recording without timestamps that provide the temporal localization
of the bird song of interest. Manual annotations can solve this issue, but they
are time consuming, expert-dependent, and cannot run on large datasets. Another
solution consists in using a labelling function that automatically segments
audio recordings before assigning a label to each segmented audio sample.
Although labelling functions were introduced to expedite strong label
assignment, their classification performance remains mostly unknown. To address
this issue and reduce label noise (wrong label assignment) in large bird song
datasets, we introduce a data-centric novel labelling function composed of
three successive steps: 1) time-frequency sound unit segmentation, 2) feature
computation for each sound unit, and 3) classification of each sound unit as
bird song or noise with either an unsupervised DBSCAN algorithm or the
supervised BirdNET neural network. The labelling function was optimized,
validated, and tested on the songs of 44 West-Palearctic common bird species.
We first showed that the segmentation of bird songs alone aggregated from 10%
to 83% of label noise depending on the species. We also demonstrated that our
labelling function was able to significantly reduce the initial label noise

different opportunities to design suitable labelling functions to build
high-quality animal vocalizations with minimum expert annotation effort.

(QoS) requirements expressed through timing metrics such as latency or Age of
Information (AoI). A possible way to achieve this is coded multipath
communication: redundancy is added to a block of information through a robust
packet-level code, transmitting across multiple independent channels to reduce
the impact of blockages or rate fluctuation. The number of these links can grow
significantly over traditional two-path schemes: in these scenarios, the
optimization of the timing metrics is non-trivial, and latency and AoI might
require different settings. In particular, packet preemption is often the
optimal solution to optimize AoI in uncoded communication, but can
significantly reduce the reliability of individual blocks. In this work, we
model the multipath communication as a fork-join D/M/(K,N)/L queue, where K
blocks of information are encoded into N>K redundant blocks. We derive the
latency and Peak AoI (PAoI) distributions for different values of the queue
size L. Our results show that preemption is not always the optimal choice, as
dropping a late packet on one path might affect the reliability of the whole
block, and that minimizing the PAoI leads to poor latency performance.

performance of both R-CNN series and anchor-free detectors. However, one-stage
anchor-based detectors lack the structure to generate high-quality or flexible
pseudo labels, leading to serious inconsistency problems in SSOD. In this
paper, we propose the Efficient Teacher framework for scalable and effective
one-stage anchor-based SSOD training, consisting of Dense Detector, Pseudo
Label Assigner, and Epoch Adaptor. Dense Detector is a baseline model that
extends RetinaNet with dense sampling techniques inspired by YOLOv5. The
Efficient Teacher framework introduces a novel pseudo label assignment
mechanism, named Pseudo Label Assigner, which makes more refined use of pseudo
labels from Dense Detector. Epoch Adaptor is a method that enables a stable and
efficient end-to-end semi-supervised training schedule for Dense Detector. The
Pseudo Label Assigner prevents the occurrence of bias caused by a large number
of low-quality pseudo labels that may interfere with the Dense Detector during
the student-teacher mutual learning mechanism, and the Epoch Adaptor utilizes
domain and distribution adaptation to allow Dense Detector to learn globally
distributed consistent features, making the training independent of the
proportion of labeled data. Our experiments show that the Efficient Teacher
framework achieves state-of-the-art results on VOC, COCO-standard, and
COCO-additional using fewer FLOPs than previous methods. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply Semi-Supervised Object Detection

  Variational Model Ensembling via Bayesian Neural Networks","Accepted by AAAI23",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep regression is an important problem with numerous applications. These
range from computer vision tasks such as age estimation from photographs, to
medical tasks such as ejection fraction estimation from echocardiograms for
disease tracking. Semi-supervised approaches for deep regression are notably
under-explored compared to classification and segmentation tasks, however.
Unlike classification tasks, which rely on thresholding functions for
generating class pseudo-labels, regression tasks use real number target
predictions directly as pseudo-labels, making them more sensitive to prediction
quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach to semi-supervised
regression, namely Uncertainty-Consistent Variational Model Ensembling (UCVME),
which improves training by generating high-quality pseudo-labels and
uncertainty estimates for heteroscedastic regression. Given that aleatoric
uncertainty is only dependent on input data by definition and should be equal
for the same inputs, we present a novel uncertainty consistency loss for
co-trained models. Our consistency loss significantly improves uncertainty
estimates and allows higher quality pseudo-labels to be assigned greater
importance under heteroscedastic regression. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
variational model ensembling approach to reduce prediction noise and generate
more robust pseudo-labels. We analytically show our method generates higher
quality targets for unlabeled data and further improves training. Experiments
show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on different
tasks and can be competitive with supervised methods that use full labels. Our

because of algorithmic decisions' growing impact on real-world applications.
Tree ensemble methods, such as Random Forests or XgBoost, are powerful learning
tools for classification tasks. However, while combining multiple trees may
provide higher prediction quality than a single one, it sacrifices the
interpretability property resulting in ""black-box"" models. In light of this, we
aim to develop an interpretable representation of a tree-ensemble model that
can provide valuable insights into its behavior. First, given a target
tree-ensemble model, we develop a hierarchical visualization tool based on a
heatmap representation of the forest's feature use, considering the frequency
of a feature and the level at which it is selected as an indicator of
importance. Next, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)
formulation for constructing a single optimal multivariate tree that accurately
mimics the target model predictions. The goal is to provide an interpretable
surrogate model based on oblique hyperplane splits, which uses only the most
relevant features according to the defined forest's importance indicators. The
MILP model includes a penalty on feature selection based on their frequency in
the forest to further induce sparsity of the splits. The natural formulation
has been strengthened to improve the computational performance of mixed-integer
software. Computational experience is carried out on benchmark datasets from
the UCI repository using a state-of-the-art off-the-shelf solver. Results show
that the proposed model is effective in yielding a shallow interpretable tree
approximating the tree-ensemble decision function.

limited utilization of goal information to effectively associate with past

into a Transformer-based stochastic generative model backbone and propose a new
goal-based trajectory predictor called ForceFormer. Differentiating from most
prior works that simply use the destination position as an input feature, we
leverage the driving force from the destination to efficiently simulate the

as another input feature to describe the avoidance action among neighboring

These fundamental questions are still hotly debated. In contemporary
linguistics, there are two major schools of thought that give completely
opposite answers. According to Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, language
cannot be learned because children are not exposed to sufficient data in their
linguistic environment. In contrast, usage-based models of language assume a
profound relationship between language structure and language use. In
particular, contextual mental processing and mental representations are assumed
to have the cognitive capacity to capture the complexity of actual language use
at all levels. The prime example is syntax, i.e., the rules by which words are
assembled into larger units such as sentences. Typically, syntactic rules are
expressed as sequences of word classes. However, it remains unclear whether
word classes are innate, as implied by universal grammar, or whether they
emerge during language acquisition, as suggested by usage-based approaches.
Here, we address this issue from a machine learning and natural language
processing perspective. In particular, we trained an artificial deep neural
network on predicting the next word, provided sequences of consecutive words as
input. Subsequently, we analyzed the emerging activation patterns in the hidden
layers of the neural network. Strikingly, we find that the internal
representations of nine-word input sequences cluster according to the word
class of the tenth word to be predicted as output, even though the neural
network did not receive any explicit information about syntactic rules or word
classes during training. This surprising result suggests, that also in the
human brain, abstract representational categories such as word classes may
naturally emerge as a consequence of predictive coding and processing during
language acquisition.

for attackers. On the other hand, the large variability of different
application scenarios and inherent heterogeneity of devices make it very
challenging to reliably detect abnormal IoT device behaviors and distinguish
these from benign behaviors. Existing approaches for detecting attacks are
mostly limited to attacks directly compromising individual IoT devices, or,
require predefined detection policies. They cannot detect attacks that utilize
the control plane of the IoT system to trigger actions in an
unintended/malicious context, e.g., opening a smart lock while the smart home
residents are absent.
  In this paper, we tackle this problem and propose ARGUS, the first
self-learning intrusion detection system for detecting contextual attacks on
IoT environments, in which the attacker maliciously invokes IoT device actions
to reach its goals. ARGUS monitors the contextual setting based on the state
and actions of IoT devices in the environment. An unsupervised Deep Neural
Network (DNN) is used for modeling the typical contextual device behavior and
detecting actions taking place in abnormal contextual settings. This
unsupervised approach ensures that ARGUS is not restricted to detecting
previously known attacks but is also able to detect new attacks. We evaluated
ARGUS on heterogeneous real-world smart-home settings and achieve at least an

Perturbations are often local, i.e. they are initially perceived only by few
individuals in the group, but can elicit a global response. This is the case of
starling flocks, that can turn very quickly to evade predators. In this paper,
we investigate the conditions under which a global change of direction can
occur upon local perturbations. Using minimal models of self-propelled
particles, we show that a collective directional response occurs on timescales
that grow with the system size and it is, therefore, a finite-size effect. The
larger the group is, the longer it will take to turn. We also show that global
coherent turns can only take place if i) the mechanism for information
propagation is efficient enough to transmit the local reaction undamped through
the whole group; and if ii) motility is not too strong, to avoid that the
perturbed individual leaves the group before the turn is complete. No
compliance with such conditions results in the group's fragmentation or in a

primarily motivated by functional brain network construction from fMRI data,

that both noise and intra-regional correlation lead to inconsistent

  Minimization and Cybersecurity Margin Maximization",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent years have witnessed increasing cyber-attack reports, e.g., the false
data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks, which result in massive damage to power
systems. This paper proposes a cost-effective two-stage cyber-defense strategy,
which minimizes the FDI attack-induced region in the system planning stage,
followed by the cybersecurity margin maximization in the system operation
stage. First, this paper proposes a shaping cyber-defense strategy that
achieves a balance between shaping the FDI attack-induced region and minimizing
the cyber-defense meters. The proposed shaping cyber-defense strategy is
formulated as a one-leader-multi-follower bi-level problem, which is converted
into a single-level mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem with
closed-form lower bounds of the big-M. Then, via optimal dispatch of operation
points, this paper proposes a dispatching cyber-defense strategy, which
achieves a trade-off between maximizing the cybersecurity margin and minimizing
the additional operation cost. This leads to a balance between the
safest-but-expensive operation point (i.e., Euclidean Chebyshev center) and the
cheapest-but-dangerous operation point. Simulation results on a modified IEEE
14 bus system verify the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the proposed
shape-and-dispatch cyber-defense strategy.

pairs of attributes foster interactions and which ones inhibit them.
  Individuals prefer to engage with the opposite ideological side, which
contradicts the echo chamber narrative. Instead, demographic groups are
homophilic, as individuals tend to interact within their own group - even in an
online setting where such attributes are not directly observable. In
particular, we observe age and income segregation consistently across years:
users tend to avoid interactions when belonging to different groups. These
results persist after controlling for the degree of interest by each

that affective polarization - the difficulty in socializing across political

models from making incorrect predictions to ensure the safety of artificial
intelligence systems. Especially in safety-critical applications such as
medical diagnosis and autonomous driving, the cost of incorrect decisions is
usually unbearable. However, neural networks often suffer from the
overconfidence issue, making high confidence for OOD data which are never seen
during training process and may be irrelevant to training data, namely
in-distribution (ID) data. Determining the reliability of the prediction is
still a difficult and challenging task. In this work, we propose
Uncertainty-Estimation with Normalized Logits (UE-NL), a robust learning method
for OOD detection, which has three main benefits. (1) Neural networks with
UE-NL treat every ID sample equally by predicting the uncertainty score of
input data and the uncertainty is added into softmax function to adjust the
learning strength of easy and hard samples during training phase, making the
model learn robustly and accurately. (2) UE-NL enforces a constant vector norm
on the logits to decouple the effect of the increasing output norm from
optimization process, which causes the overconfidence issue to some extent. (3)
UE-NL provides a new metric, the magnitude of uncertainty score, to detect OOD
data. Experiments demonstrate that UE-NL achieves top performance on common OOD
benchmarks and is more robust to noisy ID data that may be misjudged as OOD
data by other methods.

at discrete combinations of pulse parameters including pulse width (PW), pulse
repetition frequency (PRF) and number of pulses (N), which dictate unique
combinations of dose and dose rates. Currently, obtaining pulse parameters for
the desired dose and dose rate is a cumbersome manual process involving
creating, updating, and looking up values in large spreadsheets for every
treatment configuration. The purpose of this work is to present a pulse
parameter optimizer application to match intended dose and dose rate precisely
and efficiently.
  Methods: Dose and dose rate calculation have been described for a commercial
electron FLASH platform. A constrained optimization for the dose and dose rate
cost function was modelled as a mixed integer problem in MATLAB (The MathWorks
Inc., Version9.13.0 R2022b, Natick, Massachusetts). The beam and machine data
required for the application were acquired using GafChromic film and
Alternating Current Current Transformers (ACCTs). Variables for optimization
included dose per pulse (DPP) for every collimator at a specific treatment
configuration, PW and PRF measured using ACCT, and airgap factors.
  Results: Using PW, PRF, N and airgap factors as the parameters, the
application was created to optimize for dose and dose rate. Largely automating
dose and dose rate calculation reduces safety concerns associated with manual
look up and calculation of these parameters, especially when many subjects at
different doses and dose rates are to be safely managed.
  Conclusion: A pulse parameter optimization application was built in MATLAB
for a commercial electron UHDR platform to increase efficiency in the dose,
dose rate, and pulse parameter prescription process.

Therefore, variational inequalities are used in a variety of applications

the increasing size of data and models demand parallel and distributed
computing for real-world machine learning problems, most of which can be
represented as variational inequalities. Meanwhile, most distributed approaches
has a significant bottleneck - the cost of communications. The three main
techniques to reduce both the total number of communication rounds and the cost

nature. Coupling exciton-polaritons with magnetic orders grants access to rich
many-body phenomena, but has been limited by the availability of material
systems that exhibit simultaneous exciton resonances and magnetic ordering.
Here we report magnetically-dressed microcavity exciton-polaritons in the van
der Waals antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor CrSBr coupled to a Tamm plasmon
microcavity. Angle-resolved spectroscopy reveals an exceptionally high
exciton-polariton coupling strength attaining 169 meV, demonstrating
ultrastrong coupling that persists up to room temperature.
Temperature-dependent exciton-polariton spectroscopy senses the magnetic order
change from AFM to paramagnetism in CrSBr, confirming its magnetic nature. By
applying an out-of-plane magnetic field, an effective tuning of the polariton
energy is further achieved while maintaining the ultrastrong exciton-photon
coupling strength, which is attributed to the spin canting process that
modulates the interlayer exciton interaction. Our work proposes a hybrid
quantum platform enabled by robust opto-electronic-magnetic coupling, promising
for quantum interconnects and transducers.

real-life scenarios where agents engage in contractual relations that leave
some degree of uncertainty. Our starting point is the celebrated hidden-action
model and the classic notion of a contract, where the principal commits to an
outcome-contingent payment scheme for incentivizing an agent to take a costly
action. An ambiguous contract generalizes this notion by allowing the principal
to commit to a set of two or more contracts, without specifying which of these
will be employed. A natural behavioral assumption in such cases is that the
agent engages in a max-min strategy, maximizing her expected utility in the
worst case over the set of possible contracts. We show that the principal can
in general gain utility by employing an ambiguous contract, at the expense of
the agent's utility. We provide structural properties of the optimal ambiguous
contract, showing that an optimal ambiguous contract is composed of simple
contracts. We then use these properties to devise poly-time algorithms for
computing the optimal ambiguous contract. We also provide a characterization of
non-manipulable classes of contracts - those where a principal cannot gain by
employing an ambiguous contract. We show that linear contracts - unlike other
common contracts - are non-manipulable, which might help explain their
popularity. Finally, we provide bounds on the ambiguity gap - the gap between
the utility the principal can achieve by employing ambiguous contracts and the
utility the principal can achieve with a single contract.

collocation points. However, constraint violations between adjacent collocation
points may still occur. This study proposes a safety-guaranteed
collision-avoidance modeling method to eliminate the collision risks between
adjacent collocation points in using numerical optimization-based trajectory
planners. A new concept called embodied box is proposed, which is formed by
enlarging the rectangular footprint of the ego vehicle. If one can ensure that
the embodied boxes at finite collocation points are collide-free, then the ego
vehicle's footprint is collide-free at any a moment between adjacent
collocation points. We find that the geometric size of an embodied box is a
simple function of vehicle velocity and curvature. The proposed theory lays a
foundation for numerical optimization-based trajectory planners in autonomous

  in the Poisson-Boltzmann Theory of Electrical Double Layers",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.chem-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Electrical double layers (EDLs) arise when an electrolyte is in contact with
a charged surface, and are encountered in several application areas including
batteries, supercapacitors, electrocatalytic reactors, and colloids. In the
modeling of EDLs, a prominent knowledge gap has been the exclusion of van der
Waals (vdW) and soft repulsive interactions in modified Poisson-Boltzmann (PB)
theories. Although more short-ranged as compared to electrostatic interactions,
we show here that vdW interactions can play an important role in determining
the structure of the EDL via the formation of a Stern layer and in modulating
the differential capacitance of an electrode in solution. To this end, we
incorporate ion-ion and wall-ion vdW attraction and soft repulsion via a 12-6
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, resulting in a modified PB-LJ approach. The
wall-ion LJ interactions were found to have a significant effect on the
electrical potential and concentration profiles, especially close to the wall.
However, ion-ion LJ interactions do not affect the EDL structure at low bulk
ion concentrations (< 1 M). We also derive dimensionless numbers to quantify
the impact of ion-ion and wall-ion LJ interactions on the EDL. Furthermore, in
the pursuit of capturing ion-specific effects, we apply our model by
considering various combinations of ions. We observe how varying parameters
such as the electrolyte concentration and electrode potential affect the
structure of the EDL due to the competition between ion-specific LJ and
electrostatic interactions. Lastly, we show that the inclusion of vdW and soft
repulsion interactions as well as hydration effects lead to a better
qualitative agreement of the PB models with experimental double-layer
differential capacitance data. Overall, the modified PB-LJ approach presented
herein will lead to more accurate theoretical descriptions of EDLs in various
application areas.

can be used to provide a type system for physical quantities, and automated
proof support. Quantities are parameterised by dimension types, which
correspond to base vectors, and thus only quantities of the same dimension can
be equated. Since the underlying ""algebra of quantities"" induces congruences on

Alternatively, we propose a novel framework of AE-based anomaly detection,

  Cluster, Cloud and Internet Computing (CCGrid)",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scientific workflow management systems (SWMSs) and resource managers together
ensure that tasks are scheduled on provisioned resources so that all
dependencies are obeyed, and some optimization goal, such as makespan
minimization, is achieved. In practice, however, there is no clear separation
of scheduling responsibilities between an SWMS and a resource manager because
there exists no agreed-upon separation of concerns between their different
components. This has two consequences. First, the lack of a standardized API to
exchange scheduling information between SWMSs and resource managers hinders
portability. It incurs costly adaptations when a component should be replaced
by a different one (e.g., an SWMS with another SWMS on the same resource
manager). Second, due to overlapping functionalities, current installations
often actually have two schedulers, both making partial scheduling decisions
under incomplete information, leading to suboptimal workflow scheduling.
  In this paper, we propose a simple REST interface between SWMSs and resource
managers, which allows any SWMS to pass dynamic workflow information to a
resource manager, enabling maximally informed scheduling decisions. We provide
an implementation of this API as an example, using Nextflow as an SWMS and
Kubernetes as a resource manager. Our experiments with nine real-world
workflows show that this strategy reduces makespan by up to 25.1% and 10.8% on
average compared to the standard Nextflow/Kubernetes configuration.
Furthermore, a more widespread implementation of this API would enable leaner
code bases, a simpler exchange of components of workflow systems, and a unified
place to implement new scheduling algorithms.

the symmetric group can be represented by a discrete Hilbert sphere (DHS) over
an n-bit computational basis. Unlike the continuous Hilbert space defined over
a complex field in quantum computing, a DHS is defined over the finite field
GF(2). Within this DHS, the entire symmetric group can be completely described
by the complete set of n-bit binary permutation matrices. Encoding of a
plaintext can be done by randomly selecting a permutation matrix from the
symmetric group to multiply with the computational basis vector associated with
the state corresponding to the data to be encoded. Then, the resulting vector
is converted to an output state as the ciphertext. The decoding is the same
procedure but with the transpose of the pre-shared permutation matrix. We
demonstrate that under this extension, the 1-to-1 mapping in the classical OTP
is equally likely decoupled in Discrete Hilbert Space. The uncertainty
relationship between permutation matrices protects the selected pad, consisting
of M permutation matrices (also called Quantum permutation pad, or QPP). QPP
not only maintains the perfect secrecy feature of the classical formulation but

strategy is not always feasible for small data sets. Therefore, in this paper
we refine and implement an alternative Bayesian Federated Inference (BFI)
framework for multi center data with the same aim as FL. The BFI framework is
designed to cope with small data sets by inferring locally not only the optimal

to slow degrees of freedom. We test our method on the HiPen dataset of
drug-like molecules and fragments, and we show that it can accelerate the
calculation of the free energy difference of switching from a force field to a

notoriously difficult due to regulatory constraints and commercial interests.
This work proposes the application of federated learning, which we argue to be
reconcilable with the industry's constraints, as it does not require sharing of
any information that would reveal the entities' data or any other high-level
summary of it. When used on a representative GraphDTA model and the KIBA
dataset it achieves up to 15% improved performance relative to the best
available non-privacy preserving alternative. Our extensive battery of

to solve this challenge, yet they suffer from severe computation- and
memory-inefficiency that limit the scalability. To handle this issue, we
propose a novel generative model for videos, coined projected latent video
diffusion models (PVDM), a probabilistic diffusion model which learns a video
distribution in a low-dimensional latent space and thus can be efficiently
trained with high-resolution videos under limited resources. Specifically, PVDM
is composed of two components: (a) an autoencoder that projects a given video
as 2D-shaped latent vectors that factorize the complex cubic structure of video
pixels and (b) a diffusion model architecture specialized for our new
factorized latent space and the training/sampling procedure to synthesize
videos of arbitrary length with a single model. Experiments on popular video
generation datasets demonstrate the superiority of PVDM compared with previous
video synthesis methods; e.g., PVDM obtains the FVD score of 639.7 on the
UCF-101 long video (128 frames) generation benchmark, which improves 1773.4 of
the prior state-of-the-art.

  Every cyclotomic spectrum gives rise to a polygonic spectrum and we prove

Frobenius and Verschiebung maps on $\mathrm{TR}(X)$ by exhibiting
$\mathrm{TR}(X)$ as the $\mathbb{Z}$-fixedpoints of a quasifinitely genuine

ability of genetic algorithms to handle high-dimensional solution spaces

multi-armed bandit framework serves as a foundation, where each observed
simulation is incorporated into the memory of GMAB. Based on this memory,
genetic operators guide the search, as they provide powerful tools for
exploration as well as exploitation. The empirical results demonstrate that
GMAB achieves superior performance compared to benchmark algorithms from the
literature in a large variety of test problems. In all experiments, GMAB
required considerably fewer simulations to achieve similar or (far) better

axial and transverse strain can be encoded to an individual radio-frequency
identity for a cluster of nanodiamonds. When using single nanodiamonds, this
unique fingerprint can then be potentially tracked in real-time in, e.g.,
cells, as their size is compatible with metabolism intake. From a completely
different aspect, in clusters of nanodiamonds, this can already now serve as a
platform for anti-counterfeiting measures.

  classical pendulum",,,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work we study the splitting distance of a rapidly perturbed pendulum
$H(x,y,t)=\frac{1}{2}y^2+(\cos(x)-1)+\mu(\cos(x)-1)g\left(\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\right)$
with $g(\tau)=\sum_{|k|>1}g^{[k]}e^{ik\tau}$ a $2\pi$-periodic function and
$\mu,\varepsilon \ll 1$. Systems of this kind undergo exponentially small
splitting and, when $\mu\ll 1$, it is known that the Melnikov function actually
gives an asymptotic expression for the splitting function provided $g^{[\pm
1]}\neq 0$. Our study focuses on the case $g^{[\pm 1]}=0$ and it is motivated
by two main reasons. On the one hand the general understanding of the
splitting, as current results fail for a perturbation as simple as
$g(\tau)=\cos(5\tau)+\cos(4\tau)+\cos(3\tau)$. On the other hand, a study of
the splitting of invariant manifolds of tori of rational frequency $p/q$ in
Arnold's original model for diffusion leads to the consideration of
pendulum-like Hamiltonians with $
g(\tau)=\sin\left(p\cdot\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\right)+\cos\left(q\cdot\frac{t}{\varepsilon}\right),
$ where, for most $p, q\in\mathbb{Z}$ the perturbation satisfies $g^{[\pm
1]}\neq 0$. As expected, the Melnikov function is not a correct approximation
for the splitting in this case. To tackle the problem we use a splitting
formula based on the solutions of the so-called inner equation and make use of
the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. The leading exponentially small term appears at
order $\mu^n$, where $n$ is an integer determined exclusively by the harmonics
of the perturbation. We also provide an algorithm to compute it.

is its ability to serve both the navigation and tracking assignments on-demand
within a single localization scheme. Conventionally, the perspective of
navigation and tracking in wireless localization systems is viewed distinctly
as an individual system because different methodologies were required for the
implementation process. The ability to flexibly or elastically combine two
unique positioning perspectives (i.e., navigation and tracking) within a single

Thus, this article addresses and pinpoints the potential of a bidirectional UWB
localization scheme. Regarding this, the complete system model of the
bidirectional UWB localization scheme was comprehensively described based on
modular processes in this article. The demonstrative evaluation results based
on two system integration processes as well as a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, and threats) analysis of the scheme were also discussed.
Moreover, we argued that the presented bidirectional scheme can also be used as
a prospective topology for the realization of precise location estimation

alternating minimization method with extrapolation (PAMe) for $L_1$-norm PCA
are revisited and their finite-step convergence are studied. It is first shown
that NGA can be interpreted as a conditional subgradient or an alternating
maximization method. By recognizing it as a conditional subgradient, we prove
that the iterative points generated by the algorithm will be constant in
finitely many steps under a certain full-rank assumption; such an assumption
can be removed when the projection dimension is one. By treating the algorithm
as an alternating maximization, we then prove that the objective value will be
fixed after at most $\left\lceil\frac{F^{\max}}{\tau_0} \right\rceil$ steps,
where the stopping point satisfies certain optimality conditions. Then, a
slight modification of NGA with improved convergence properties is analyzed. It
is shown that the iterative points generated by the modified algorithm will not
change after at most $\left\lceil\frac{2F^{\max}}{\tau} \right\rceil$ steps;
furthermore, the stopping point satisfies certain optimality conditions if the
proximal parameter $\tau$ is small enough.
  For PAMe, it is proved that the sign variable will remain constant after
finitely many steps and the algorithm can output a point satisfying certain
optimality condition, if the parameters are small enough and a full rank
assumption is satisfied. Moreover, if there is no proximal term on the
projection matrix related subproblem, then the iterative points generated by
this modified algorithm will not change after at most $\left\lceil
\frac{4F^{\max}}{\tau(1-\gamma)} \right\rceil$ steps and the stopping point
also satisfies certain optimality conditions, provided similar assumptions as
those for PAMe. The full rank assumption can be removed when the projection

waves from almost one hundred coalescences of compact objects (black holes and
neutron stars). This article presents the results of a search performed with
data from the ANTARES telescope to identify neutrino counterparts to the
gravitational wave sources detected during the third LIGO/Virgo observing run
and reported in the catalogues GWTC-2, GWTC-2.1, and GWTC-3. This search is
sensitive to all-sky neutrinos of all flavours and of energies $>100$ GeV,
thanks to the inclusion of both track-like events (mainly induced by $\nu_\mu$
charged-current interactions) and shower-like events (induced by other
interaction types). Neutrinos are selected if they are detected within $\pm
500$ s from the GW merger and with a reconstructed direction compatible with
its sky localisation. No significant excess is found for any of the 80 analysed
GW events, and upper limits on the neutrino emission are derived. Using the
information from the GW catalogues and assuming isotropic emission, upper
limits on the total energy $E_{\rm tot, \nu}$ emitted as neutrinos of all
flavours and on the ratio $f_\nu = E_{\rm tot, \nu}/E_{\rm GW}$ between
neutrino and GW emissions are also computed. Finally, a stacked analysis of all
the 72 binary black hole mergers (respectively the 7 neutron star - black hole
merger candidates) has been performed to constrain the typical neutrino
emission within this population, leading to the limits: $E_{\rm tot, \nu} < 4.0
\times 10^{53}$ erg and $f_\nu < 0.15$ (respectively, $E_{\rm tot, \nu} < 3.2
\times 10^{53}$ erg and $f_\nu < 0.88$) for $E^{-2}$ spectrum and isotropic
emission. Other assumptions including softer spectra and non-isotropic
scenarios have also been tested.

Internet of Things (IoT) devices to provide high-quality vision services will
revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world. Due to the
contradiction between the limited resources of IoT devices and
resource-intensive ViT models, the use of cloud servers to assist ViT model
training has become mainstream. However, due to the larger number of parameters
and floating-point operations (FLOPs) of the existing ViT models, the model
parameters transmitted by cloud servers are large and difficult to run on
resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, this paper proposes a
transmission-friendly ViT model, TFormer, for deployment on
resource-constrained IoT devices with the assistance of a cloud server. The
high performance and small number of model parameters and FLOPs of TFormer are
attributed to the proposed hybrid layer and the proposed partially connected
feed-forward network (PCS-FFN). The hybrid layer consists of nonlearnable
modules and a pointwise convolution, which can obtain multitype and multiscale
features with only a few parameters and FLOPs to improve the TFormer
performance. The PCS-FFN adopts group convolution to reduce the number of
parameters. The key idea of this paper is to propose TFormer with few model
parameters and FLOPs to facilitate applications running on resource-constrained
IoT devices to benefit from the high performance of the ViT models.
Experimental results on the ImageNet-1K, MS COCO, and ADE20K datasets for image
classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate
that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, TFormer-S achieves 5% higher accuracy on ImageNet-1K than
ResNet18 with 1.4$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs.

approximation approach, the scheme constructs tubes that contain predicted

guaranteeing constraint satisfaction. An optimal control problem is solved as a
sequence of convex programs, without the need of pre-computed error bounds. We
develop the scheme initially in the absence of external disturbances and show
that the proposed nominal approach is non-conservative, with the solutions of
successive convex programs converging to a locally optimal solution for the
original optimal control problem. We extend the approach to the case of
additive disturbances using a novel strategy for selecting linearization points
and seed trajectories. As a result we formulate a robust receding horizon
strategy with guarantees of recursive feasibility and stability of the
closed-loop system.

being planned for the next decade, and it is expected to detect most of the
coalescences of compact objects in the universe with masses up to a thousand
times the solar mass. Among the several possible applications of current and
future detections, we focus on the impact on the measure of the luminosity
distance of the sources, which is an invaluable tool for constraining the
cosmic expansion history of the universe. Focusing on two specific detector
topologies, triangular and L-shape, we investigate how topology and relative
orientation of up to three detectors can minimise the uncertainty measure of
the luminosity distance. While the precision in distance measurement is
correlated with several geometric angles determining the source position and
orientation, focusing on the bright standard siren case, we obtain analytic and
numerical results for its uncertainty depending on type and number of detectors
composing a network, and the inclination angle of the binary plane with respect
to the wave propagation direction. We also analyse the best relative location
and orientation of two third generation detectors to minimise luminosity
distance uncertainty, showing that the inclination angle distribution plays an
important role in precision recovery of luminosity distance, and that a
suitably arranged network of detectors can reduce drastically the uncertainty
measure, approaching the limit imposed by lensing effects intervening between
source and detector.

we derive a spin-layer model on a triangular lattice in the large-U limit where
the inter-layer tunneling contributes as a sublattice-dependent transverse
Ising field for the layer pseudospin. We then show that the $n=2$ Mott

communication channel using only a small number of channel accesses -- both for
listening and sending -- and the resulting algorithm is resistant to
adversarial noise.
  The shared channel operates over a sequence of synchronized time slots, and
in any slot agents may attempt to broadcast a packet. An agent's broadcast
succeeds if no other agent broadcasts during that slot. If two or more agents
broadcast in the same slot, then the broadcasts collide and both broadcasts
fail. An agent listening on the channel during a slot receives ternary
feedback, learning whether that slot had silence, a successful broadcast, or a
collision. Agents are (adversarially) injected into the system over time. The
goal is to coordinate the agents so that each is able to successfully broadcast
its packet.
  A contention-resolution protocol is measured both in terms of its throughput
and the number of slots during which an agent broadcasts or listens. Most prior
work assumes that listening is free and only tries to minimize the number of
broadcasts.
  This paper answers two foundational questions. First, is constant throughput
achievable when using polylogarithmic channel accesses per agent, both for
listening and broadcasting? Second, is constant throughput still achievable
when an adversary jams some slots by broadcasting noise in them? Specifically,
for $N$ packets arriving over time and $J$ jammed slots, we give an algorithm
that with high probability in $N+J$ guarantees $\Theta(1)$ throughput and
achieves on average $O(\texttt{polylog}(N+J))$ channel accesses against an
adaptive adversary. We also have per-agent high-probability guarantees on the
number of channel accesses -- either $O(\texttt{polylog}(N+J))$ or $O((J+1)
\texttt{polylog}(N))$, depending on how quickly the adversary can react to what
is being broadcast.

a modified superstructure formulation to implement streams with variable

terms, such as those of LMTD, HEX areas and energy balances, are
piecewise-linear approximated with simplex or hyperplane models. The
translation to MILP is achieved with highly efficient logarithmic coding. One
promising application is implementing utilities as streams with variable
temperatures and flow capacities. On the one hand, this enables multi-stage
heat transfer with stream splits and intermediate utility placement. On the
other hand, the temperatures of the utilities can be included as a design
parameter in optimizing the heat exchanger network. This makes sense if only
the sensible heat of, e.g., thermal oil, water or flue gas, is used as a
utility where the inlet and outlet temperatures do not necessarily have to be
specified a priori. To examine whether the implementation of utilities as
streams leads to more cost-effective solutions, three representative case
studies were considered. The results show that reducing the outlet temperature

  We derived new experimental upper limits on such exotic spin-dependent
interactions at astronomical interaction ranges by analyzing existing data from
laboratory measurements on the Lorentz and CPT violation.
  We set the most stringent experimental limits on $g_S^Ng_P^n$ ranging from
$\sim 2\times 10^{10}$m to $\sim 10^{14}$m.

time series. A periodogram can be used to measure the intensities of
oscillations at different frequencies over an entire time series but sometimes
we are interested in measuring how periodicity intensity at a specific
frequency varies throughout the time series. This can be done by calculating
periodicity intensity within a window then sliding and recalculating the
intensity for the window, giving an indication of how periodicity intensity at
a specific frequency changes throughout the series. We illustrate three
applications of this the first of which is movements of a herd of new-born
calves where we show how intensity of the 24h periodicity increases and
decreases synchronously across the herd. We also show how changes in 24h
periodicity intensity of activities detected from in-home sensors can be
indicative of overall wellness. We illustrate this on several weeks of sensor
data gathered from each of the homes of 23 older adults. Our third application

is formulated. It is proved that, if the dielectric making the waveguide is
nonabsorptive and nondispersive, this velocity can be superluminal. This result
is validated in the framework of quantum electrodynamics, demonstrating that
the average velocity of the photon inside the waveguide is given by the

distribution shifts and noise in our ever-changing environment. Deep neural
networks (DNNs), however, exhibit catastrophic forgetting and the learned
representations drift drastically as they encounter a new task. This alludes to
a different error-based learning mechanism in the brain. Unlike DNNs, where
learning scales linearly with the magnitude of the error, the sensitivity to
errors in the brain decreases as a function of their magnitude. To this end, we
propose \textit{ESMER} which employs a principled mechanism to modulate error
sensitivity in a dual-memory rehearsal-based system. Concretely, it maintains a
memory of past errors and uses it to modify the learning dynamics so that the
model learns more from small consistent errors compared to large sudden errors.
We also propose \textit{Error-Sensitive Reservoir Sampling} to maintain
episodic memory, which leverages the error history to pre-select low-loss
samples as candidates for the buffer, which are better suited for retaining
information. Empirical results show that ESMER effectively reduces forgetting
and abrupt drift in representations at the task boundary by gradually adapting
to the new task while consolidating knowledge. Remarkably, it also enables the
model to learn under high levels of label noise, which is ubiquitous in
real-world data streams.

DKT-STDRL extracts spatial features from students' learning history sequence,

spatial feature information of students' exercise sequences. Then, the spatial
features are connected with the original students' exercise features as joint
learning features. Then, the joint features are input into the BiLSTM part.
Finally, the BiLSTM part extracts the temporal features from the joint learning

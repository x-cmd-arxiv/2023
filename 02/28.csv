understanding direct reciprocity and cooperation in pairwise encounters.
However, measuring the morality of various IPD strategies is still largely
lacking. Here, we partially address this issue by proposing a suit of plausible
morality metrics to quantify four aspects of justice. We focus our closed-form
calculation on the class of reactive strategies because of their mathematical
tractability and expressive power. We define reactive means as a tool for
studying how actors in the IPD and Iterated Snowdrift Game (ISG) behave under
typical circumstances. We compute reactive means for four functions intended to
capture human intuitions about ``goodness'' and ``fair play''. Two of these
functions are strongly anticorrelated with success in the IPD and ISG, and the
other two are weakly anticorrelated with success. Our results will aid in
evaluating and comparing powerful IPD strategies based on machine learning
algorithms, using simple and intuitive morality metrics.

turbulence quantities, e.g., the kinetic energy dissipation rate and enstrophy,
schemes higher than second-order for spatial derivatives can greatly improve
the prediction of these quantities in the Taylor-Green vortex problem. In
contrast, a second-order reconstruction of the time series data indicates very
good accuracy for the kinetic energy dissipation rate. The present findings can
be considered as further numerical evidence of the capability of the lattice
Boltzmann method to simulate turbulent flows, which is consistent with its
proven feature of low numerical diffusion.

expected to perform in uncertain environments. Therefore the identification of
scenarios that prevent a CPS from performing according to its requirements is
of fundamental importance. However, the multidisciplinary nature of CPS can
make it difficult to identify such scenarios. In this article, we investigate
the testing of CPS developed using control theory. In such systems, the
software is developed collaboratively by control engineers and software
engineers. When testing, it is important to account for this multidisciplinary
development context. In particular, control engineers make design assumptions
when contributing to system development in order to leverage control-theory and
obtain guarantees on the CPS behaviour. However, such assumptions are not
always satisfied in the implemented system and their falsification can lead to
the loss of the control-theoretical guarantees. We define the problem of
generating and identifying test cases that falsify such design assumptions as
the stress testing of control-based CPS. Among the types of assumptions listed
in the article, we focus on the use of linearised models of the physics. To
generate test cases that falsify such assumptions, we leverage control theory
to develop a qualitative characterisation of the input space of the control
layer in CPS. We then propose a novel test case parametrisation for
control-based CPS and use it together with the proposed characterisation to
develop a testing approach aiming at falsifying the targeted assumptions. We
evaluate our testing approach on six case studies including drone position
control and continuous current motor control. Our results show that the
proposed testing approach is effective at falsifying the linearity design
assumption and the stress test cases can be used to highlight the causes of
assumption violations.

for the robot behavior, otherwise collaboration cannot happen. In this paper,
we rely on Markov decision models, representing the uncertainty over the human
objective as a probability distribution over a finite set of objective
functions (inducing a distribution over human behaviors). Based on this, we
propose two contributions: 1) an approach to automatically generate an
uncertain human behavior (a policy) for each given objective function while
accounting for possible robot behaviors; and 2) a robot planning algorithm that
is robust to the above-mentioned uncertainties and relies on solving a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) obtained by reasoning on a
distribution over human behaviors. A co-working scenario allows conducting

leads to the creation of the directed flow $v_1$. In turn, the spectator
shadowing of the in-plane expansion leads to a preferred decoupling of hadrons

observable final state hadrons. We propose a measurement of $v_1-v_2$ flow
correlations and of the elliptic flow of dileptons as methods to pin down this

the unique opportunity for the HADES and CBM collaborations to measure the

investigate several joint sampling and transmission policies, including a

metrics. Specifically, we investigate the real-time reconstruction error and
its variance, the cost of actuation error, the consecutive error, and the cost
of memory error. These metrics capture different characteristics of the system
performance, such as the impact of erroneous actions and the timing of errors.
In addition, we propose a randomized stationary sampling and transmission
policy and we derive closed-form expressions for the aforementioned metrics. We
then formulate two optimization problems. The first optimization problem aims
to minimize the time-averaged reconstruction error subject to time-averaged
sampling cost constraint. Then, we compare the optimal randomized stationary

results show that in the scenario of constrained sampling generation, the

performs the best. The objective of the second optimization problem is to
obtain an optimal sampling policy that minimizes the average consecutive error

developed to account for the large gradients, fast phenomena, wave propagation,

orient among the models, mainly due to their various thermodynamic backgrounds
and possible compatibility issues. Additionally, in light of the recent
findings on the field of non-Fourier heat conduction, it is not even
straightforward how to interpret and utilize a non-Fourier heat equation,
primarily when one aims to thermally design the material structure to construct
the new generation of thermal metamaterials. Adding that numerous modeling
strategies can be found in the literature accompanying different
interpretations even for the same heat equation makes it even more difficult to
orient ourselves and find a comprehensive picture of this field of research.
Therefore, this review aims to ease the orientation among advanced heat
equations beyond Fourier by discussing properties concerning their possible
practical applications in light of experiments. We start from the simplest
model with basic principles and notions, then proceed toward the more complex
models related to coupled phenomena such as ballistic heat conduction. We do
not enter the often complicated technical details of each thermodynamic
framework but do not aim to compare each approach. However, we still briefly
present their background to highlight their origin and the limitations acting
on the models. Additionally, the field of non-Fourier heat conduction has
become quite segmented, and that paper also aims to provide a common ground, a
comprehensive mutual understanding of the basics of each model, together with
what phenomenon they can be applied to.

machine learning approaches that have been proposed throughout the years.
However, in some cases, higher dimensional quantum systems may prove to be
advantageous. Here, we explore the capabilities of multi-level quantum systems,
so-called qudits, for their use in a quantum machine learning context. We
formulate classification and regression problems with the data re-uploading
approach and demonstrate that a quantum circuit operating on a single qudit is
able to successfully learn highly non-linear decision boundaries of
classification problems such as the MNIST digit recognition problem. We
demonstrate that the performance strongly depends on the relation between the
qudit states representing the labels and the structure of labels in the
training data set. Such a bias can lead to substantial performance improvement
over qubit-based circuits in cases where the labels and qudit states are
well-aligned. Furthermore, we elucidate the influence of the choice of the
elementary operators and show that the non-linear squeezing operator is
necessary to achieve good performances. We also show that there exists a
trade-off for qudit systems between the number of circuit-generating operators
in each processing layer and the total number of layers needed to achieve a
given accuracy. Finally, we compare classification results from numerically
exact simulations and their equivalent implementation on actual IBM quantum

attention-based decoder by filtering out irrelevant lane segments.
Additionally, unlike one-stage prediction models, LAformer utilizes predictions

feature a transformation at a critical temperature, referred to as the volume
phase transition temperature. The question of whether this transformation
occurs as a smooth or as a discontinuous one is still a matter of debate. This
question can be addressed by studying individual microgels trapped in optical
tweezers. For this aim, composite particles were obtained by decorating pNIPAM
microgels with iron oxide nanocubes. These composites become self-heating when
illuminated by the infrared trapping laser, featuring Hot Brownian Motion
within the trap. Above a certain laser power, a single decorated microgel
features a volume phase transition that is discontinuous, while the usual
continuous sigmoidal-like dependence is recovered after averaging over
different microgels. The collective sigmoidal behavior enables the application
of a power-to-temperature calibration and provides the effective drag
coefficient of the self-heating microgels, thus establishing these composite
particles as potential micro-thermometers and micro-heaters. Moreover, the
self-heating microgels also exhibit an unexpected and intriguing bistability
behavior above the critical temperature, probably due to partial collapses of
the microgel. These results set the stage for further studies and the
development of applications based on the Hot Brownian Motion of soft particles.

this is 4x larger than any functional backprop-trained SNN to date. We achieve
this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to
reduce quadratic computational complexity to linear with increasing sequence

modest signal-to-noise ratio, making difficult a pile-up pulse-shape

dynamics, particularly in complex systems. Simulation is a promising tool to
resolve this issue, but previous methods are limited by the curse of
dimensionality, namely, that the number of bases increases exponentially in the
number of photons. Here we mitigate this dimensionality scaling by focusing on
optical system composed of linear-optical objects. We decompose the time
evolutionary operator on multiple photons into a group of time evolution
operators acting on a single photon. Since the dimension of a single-photon
time evolution operator is exponentially smaller than that of a multi-photon
one in the number of photons, the decomposition enables the multi-photon

calculated properties are quantitatively comparable to the experimental

training performance significantly decreases as the down-sampling factor
increases. In this paper, we bring together the down-sampling strategies for

stellar parameters. In view of this, we perform a systematic study by
simulating a sequence of WR-star spectra for different temperatures and
mass-loss rates using $\beta$-type laws with $0.5\leq\beta\leq 20$. We quantify
the impact of varying $v(r)$ by analysing diagnostic lines and spectral
classifications of emergent model spectra computed with the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet

consistent -- hydro -- model atmospheres. Our analysis confirms that the choice
of the $\beta$-exponent has a strong impact on WR-star spectra, affecting line
widths, line strengths and line profiles. In some parameter regimes, the entire
range of WR subtypes could be covered. Comparison with observed WR stars and
hydro models revealed that values of $\beta \gtrsim 8$ are unlikely to be
realized in nature, but a range of $\beta$-values needs to be considered in
spectral analysis. UV spectroscopy is crucial here to avoid an underestimation
of the terminal velocity $v_\infty$. Neither single- nor double-$\beta$
descriptions yield an acceptable approximation of the inner wind when compared

characterised by strong interactions due to the long-range nature of the
hydrodynamic fields generated by individual organisms. As a result, suspensions
of rear-actuated `pusher' swimmers such as bacteria exhibit a collective motion
state often referred to as `bacterial turbulence', characterised by large-scale
chaotic flows. The onset of collective motion in pusher suspensions is
classically understood within the framework of mean-field kinetic theories for
dipolar swimmers. In bulk 2-D and 3-D, the theory predicts that the instability
leading to bacterial turbulence is due to mutual swimmer reorientation and sets
in at the largest length scale available to the suspension. Here, we construct
a similar kinetic theory for the case of a dipolar microswimmer suspension
confined to a two-dimensional plane embedded in a three-dimensional
incompressible fluid. This setting qualitatively mimics the effect of swimming
close to a two-dimensional interface. We show that the in-plane flow fields are
effectively compressible in spite of the incompressibility of the 3-D bulk
fluid. We analyse stability of the homogeneous and isotropic state, and find
two types of instability that are qualitatively different from the bulk,
three-dimensional case: First, we show that the analogue of the orientational
pusher instability leading to bacterial turbulence in bulk systems instead
occurs at the smallest length-scale available to the system. Second, an
instability associated with density variations arises in puller suspensions as
a generic consequence of the effective in-plane compressibility. Given these
qualitative differences with respect to the standard bulk setting we conclude
that confinement can have a crucial role in determining the collective
behaviour of microswimmer suspensions.

links (pairwise interactions) and triangles (three-way interactions). We
approximate this contagion process with a mean-field model and find that for
strong enough community structure, the two communities can hold very different
average opinions. We determine the regimes of structural and infectious

atmospheric characterization, especially for the hottest gas giant exoplanets
known as ultrahot Jupiters (UHJs). High-resolution spectra are sensitive to 3D
effects, making complex 3D atmospheric models important for interpreting data.
Moreover, these planets are expected to host magnetic fields that will shape
their resulting atmospheric circulation patterns, but little modeling work has
been done to investigate these effects. In this paper, we generate
high-resolution transmission spectra from General Circulation Models for the
canonical UHJ WASP-76b with three different magnetic treatments in order to
understand the influence of magnetic forces on the circulation. In general,
spectra from all models have increasingly blueshifted net Doppler shifts as
transit progresses, but we find that the differing temperature and wind fields
in the upper atmospheres of these models result in measurable differences. We
find that magnetic effects may be contributing to the unusual trends previously
seen in transmission for this planet. Our $B=3$ Gauss active drag model in
particular shows unique trends not found in the models with simpler or no
magnetic effects. The net Doppler shifts are additionally influenced by the
dominant opacity sources in each wavelength range considered, as each species
probes different regions of the atmosphere and are sensitive to spatial
differences in the circulation. This work highlights the ongoing need for

Egocentric networks, networks of relationships around a focal individual,

differences within this pattern. However, the generality and the driving

tie strengths in egocentric networks across multiple datasets containing

egocentric network evolution, we show that the observed universality can be
attributed to the competition between cumulative advantage and random choice,
two general mechanisms of tie reinforcement whose balance determines the amount

the fundamental issue of estimation error in Kelly portfolio optimization by
defining a ``ball"" of distributions close to the empirical return distribution
using the Wasserstein metric and seeking a robust log-optimal portfolio against
the worst-case distribution from the Wasserstein ball. Enhancing the Kelly
portfolio using Wasserstein DRO is a natural step to take, given many
successful applications of the latter in areas such as machine learning for
generating robust data-driven solutions. However, naive application of
Wasserstein DRO to the growth-optimal portfolio problem can lead to several
issues, which we resolve through careful modelling. Our proposed model is both
practically motivated and efficiently solvable as a convex program. Using

Wasserstein-Kelly portfolio can outperform the Kelly portfolio in out-of-sample

analyzing the effects of a partially absorbing reactive surface, in which the
probability of absorption depends upon the amount of surface-particle contact
time. Prior to absorption, the surface is typically assumed to act as a totally
reflecting boundary, which means that the contact time is determined by a
Brownian functional known as the boundary local time. In this paper we develop
a class of encounter-based models that deal with absorption at sticky
boundaries. Sticky boundaries occur in a diverse range of applications,
including cell biology, colloidal physics, active matter, finance, and human
crowd dynamics. We begin by constructing a one-dimensional encounter-based
model of sticky Brownian motion (BM), which is based on the zero-range limit of
non-sticky BM with a short-range attractive potential well near the origin. In
this limit, the boundary-contact time is given by the amount of time
(occupation time) that the particle spends at the origin. We calculate the
joint probability density or propagator for the particle position and the
occupation time, and then identify an absorption event as the first time that
the occupation time crosses a randomly generated threshold. Different models of
absorption correspond to different choices for the random threshold probability
distribution. We illustrate the theory by considering diffusion in a finite
interval with a partially absorbing sticky boundary at one end. We show how
various quantities of interest depend on moments of the random threshold
distribution. Finally, we determine how sticky BM can be obtained by taking a
particular diffusion limit of a sticky run-and-tumble particle (RTP). The
diffusion limit is well-defined provided that the velocity of the RTP is biased
and spatially varying within a boundary layer around the origin.

which is similar to the temporally-coherence property in a video. To solve this
problem, we propose a novel transformer network for Unordered Multiple Images

and designed blocks for token rectification that mine the correlation between
similar tokens from different views to achieve decoupled inter-view encoding.
Afterward, all tokens acquired from various branches are compressed into a
fixed-size compact representation while preserving rich information for
reconstruction by leveraging the similarities between tokens. We empirically
demonstrate on ShapeNet and confirm that our decoupled learning method is
adaptable for unordered multiple images. Meanwhile, the experiments also verify

the blowing-up argument on domains with blowing-up cone boundary (BCB domains

blowing-up techniques in previous papers work on $C^1$-smooth domains, we are
able to apply blowing-up analysis on more general BCB domains on which the

challenge in deep learning-based medical image analysis, particularly for chest
X-rays. Several methods have been proposed to address this domain shift, such
as utilizing adversarial learning or multi-domain mixups to extract
domain-invariant high-level features. However, these methods do not explicitly
account for or regularize the content and style attributes of the extracted
domain-invariant features. Recent studies have demonstrated that CNN models
exhibit a strong bias toward styles (i.e., textures) rather than content, in
stark contrast to the human-vision system. Explainable representations are
paramount for a robust and generalizable understanding of medical images. Thus,
the learned high-level semantic features need to be both content-specific,
i.e., pathology-specific and domain-agnostic, as well as style invariant.
Inspired by this, we propose a novel framework that improves cross-domain
performances by focusing more on content while reducing style bias. We employ a
style randomization module at both image and feature levels to create stylized
perturbation features while preserving the content using an end-to-end
framework. We extract the global features from the backbone model for the same
chest X-ray with and without style randomized. We apply content consistency
regularization between them to tweak the framework's sensitivity toward content
markers for accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on unseen domain test
datasets demonstrate that our proposed pipeline is more robust in the presence
of domain shifts and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is

serverless computing is a new paradigm for cloud computing that uses functions

machine learning can speed up the training process and allow more complex
models to be trained. Several topologies of distributed machine learning have
been established (centralized, parameter server, peer-to-peer). However, the
parameter server architecture may have limitations in terms of fault tolerance,
including a single point of failure and complex recovery processes. Moreover,
training machine learning in a peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture can offer
benefits in terms of fault tolerance by eliminating the single point of
failure. In a P2P architecture, each node or worker can act as both a server
and a client, which allows for more decentralized decision making and
eliminates the need for a central coordinator. In this position paper, we
propose exploring the use of serverless computing in distributed machine
learning training and comparing the performance of P2P architecture with the

the recent reinforcement learning (RL) literature to also cover uncertain

significantly smaller model for detoxification, which can be applied to diverse
LLMs as long as they share the same vocabulary. Importantly, our method does
not require access to the internal representations of the LLM, but only the

effect, while buoyancy effects caused by the density difference between the
droplets, diffusing product, and ambient fluid are usually overlooked. Recent
experiments have observed active droplet clustering phenomena due to
buoyancy-driven convection (Kruger et al. Eur. Phys. J. E, vol. 39, 2016,
pp.1-9). In this study, we numerically analyze the buoyancy effect in addition
to Marangoni flow, characterized by Peclet number $Pe$. The buoyancy effects
originate from (i) the density difference between the droplet and the ambient
liquid, which is characterized by Galileo number $Ga$, and (ii) the density
difference between the diffusing product (i.e. filled micelles) and the ambient
liquid, characterized by a solutal Rayleigh number $Ra$. We analyze how the
attracting and repulsing behavior depends on the control parameters $Pe$, $Ga$,
and $Ra$. We find that while Marangoni flow causes repulsion, the buoyancy
effect leads to attraction, and even collisions can take place at high Ra. We
also observe a delayed collision as $Ga$ increases. Moreover, we derive that
the attracting velocity, characterized by a Reynolds number $Re_d$, is
proportional to $Ra^{1/4}/(l/R)$, where $l/R$ is the normalized distance by
radius between neighboring droplets. Finally, we obtain repulsive velocity,
characterized by $Re_{rep}$, as proportional to $PeRa^{-0.38}$. The balance of
attractive and repulsive effects results in $Pe \sim Ra^{0.63}$, which agrees
with the transition curve between regimes with and without collision.

dedicated domain-specific accelerators. In this work, we survey different
approaches for efficient Transformer inference, including: (i) analysis and

similarities and differences with previous convolutional models; (ii)
implications of Transformer architecture on hardware, including the impact of
non-linear operations such as Layer Normalization, Softmax, and GELU, as well

Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. As most existing Arabic speech
corpora do not contain all diacritical marks, which represent short vowels and
other phonetic information in Arabic script, current state-of-the-art ASR
models do not produce full diacritization in their output. Automatic text-based
diacritization has previously been employed both as a pre-processing step to
train diacritized ASR, or as a post-processing step to diacritize the resulting
ASR hypotheses. It is generally believed that input diacritization degrades ASR
performance, but no systematic evaluation of ASR diacritization performance,
independent of ASR performance, has been conducted to date. In this paper, we
attempt to experimentally clarify whether input diacritiztation indeed degrades
ASR quality, and to compare the diacritic recognition performance against
text-based diacritization as a post-processing step. We start with pre-trained
Arabic ASR models and fine-tune them on transcribed speech data with different
diacritization conditions: manual, automatic, and no diacritization. We isolate
diacritic recognition performance from the overall ASR performance using
coverage and precision metrics. We find that ASR diacritization significantly
outperforms text-based diacritization in post-processing, particularly when the
ASR model is fine-tuned with manually diacritized transcripts.

Multiple hotspots have long been identified as potential indicators of jet

backflow-driven shock: the so-called Dentist's Drill and Splatter Spot models.
We created high-resolution simulations of precessing jets with a range of

additional mechanisms for multiple hotspot formation: (1) the splitting of a
large terminal hotspots into passive and active components; (2) jet stream
splitting resulting in two active hotspots; (3) dynamic multiple hotspot
complexes that form as a result of jet termination in a turbulent cocoon,
linked here to rapid precession. We show that these distinct types of multiple
hotspots are difficult to differentiate in synthetic radio maps, particularly
hotspot complexes which can easily be mistaken for the jet itself. We discuss
the implication for hypothesised binary supermassive black hole systems where
jet precession is a key component of the morphology, and show a selection of

identifying feature points on the robot. However, learning-based methods are
data-hungry and hence not suitable for soft and prototyping robots, as building
such bench-marking datasets is usually infeasible. In this work, we achieve
image-based robot pose estimation and shape reconstruction from camera images.
Our method requires no precise robot meshes, but rather utilizes a
differentiable renderer and primitive shapes. It hence can be applied to robots
for which CAD models might not be available or are crude. Our parameter
estimation pipeline is fully differentiable. The robot shape and pose are
estimated iteratively by back-propagating the image loss to update the

  Variational Inequalities: Improved Analysis under Weaker Conditions","40 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.GT cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Single-call stochastic extragradient methods, like stochastic past
extragradient (SPEG) and stochastic optimistic gradient (SOG), have gained a
lot of interest in recent years and are one of the most efficient algorithms
for solving large-scale min-max optimization and variational inequalities
problems (VIP) appearing in various machine learning tasks. However, despite
their undoubted popularity, current convergence analyses of SPEG and SOG
require a bounded variance assumption. In addition, several important questions
regarding the convergence properties of these methods are still open, including
mini-batching, efficient step-size selection, and convergence guarantees under
different sampling strategies. In this work, we address these questions and
provide convergence guarantees for two large classes of structured non-monotone
VIPs: (i) quasi-strongly monotone problems (a generalization of strongly
monotone problems) and (ii) weak Minty variational inequalities (a
generalization of monotone and Minty VIPs). We introduce the expected residual
condition, explain its benefits, and show how it can be used to obtain a
strictly weaker bound than previously used growth conditions, expected
co-coercivity, or bounded variance assumptions. Equipped with this condition,
we provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of single-call
extragradient methods for different step-size selections, including constant,
decreasing, and step-size-switching rules. Furthermore, our convergence
analysis holds under the arbitrary sampling paradigm, which includes importance
sampling and various mini-batching strategies as special cases.

the violation of Bell's inequality in the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)
form with entangled quantum states. First, we begin with a discussion of the
1935 Einstein-Podolski-Rosen (EPR) paradox (i.e., incompleteness of quantum
mechanics) that emerges from putting the emphasis on Einstein's locality and
the absolute character of physical phenomena. Second, we discuss Bell's 1971
derivation of the 1969 CHSH form of the original 1964 Bell inequality in the
context of a realistic local hidden-variable theory (RLHVT). Third, identifying
the quantum-mechanical spin correlation coefficient with the RLHVT one, we
follow Gisin's 1991 analysis to show that quantum mechanics violates Bell's
inequality when systems are in entangled quantum states. For pedagogical
purposes, we show how the extent of this violation depends both on the
orientation of the polarizers and the degree of entanglement of the quantum
states. Fourth, we discuss the basics of the experimental verification of
Bell's inequality in an actual laboratory as presented in the original 1982

probe the intrinsic topology of the Fermi sea of a two-dimensional electron gas

ballistic 2DEG, and exhibits low-energy Andreev bound states that propagate
$\textit{along}$ the junction. It has been shown that measuring the nonlocal
Landauer conductance due to these Andreev modes in a narrow linear junction
leads to a topological Andreev rectification (TAR) effect characterized by a
quantized conductance that is sensitive to the Euler characteristic $\chi_F$ of
the 2DEG Fermi sea. Here we expand on that analysis and consider more realistic
device geometries that go beyond the narrow linear junction and fully adiabatic
limits considered earlier. Wider junctions exhibit additional Andreev modes
that contribute to the transport and degrade the quantization of the
conductance. Nonetheless, we show that an appropriately defined
$\textit{rectified conductance}$ remains robustly quantized provided large
momentum scattering is suppressed. We verify and demonstrate these predictions
by performing extensive numerical simulations of realistic device geometries.
We introduce a simple model system that demonstrates the robustness of the
rectified conductance for wide linear junctions as well as point contacts, even
when the nonlocal conductance is not quantized. Motivated by recent
experimental advances, we model devices in specific materials, including InAs
quantum wells, as well as monolayer and bilayer graphene. These studies
indicate that for sufficiently ballistic samples observation of the TAR effect
should be within experimental reach.

in the tidal disruption of the WD. During this encounter, the WD can undergo a
thermonuclear explosion due to its tidal compression, resulting in an optical
transient similar to a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), hereafter a Ia-TDE.
Nevertheless, this will only be physically observable if the BH is $\lesssim
10^5$M$_\odot$. Finding a Ia-TDE would therefore imply the discovery of an
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) $\lesssim 10^5$ M$_\odot$. Here, we search
the entire Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream for the elusive
Ia-TDEs. We restrict our search to nuclear transients in dwarf galaxies, the
likely sites for IMBHs, and find a total of six possible nuclear Ia-TDE
candidates. We find SN\,2020lrt to be the most likely Ia-TDE candidate, thanks
to its strong resemblance to light curve and spectroscopic models of Ia-TDEs.
We measure the stellar masses of the dwarf galaxies hosting these transients to
be $\lesssim 10^{9}$M$_\odot$; if confirmed to harbor BHs, these would prove
the existence of IMBHs in some of the lowest-mass galaxies known. Additionally,
we searched for off-nuclear Ia-TDEs, but were unable to find more robust
candidates in the outskirts of galaxies than in their nuclei. This supports the
hypothesis that the nuclear Ia-TDEs candidates are WDs tidally compressed by
IMBHs in the cores of galaxies, as opposed to a class of transient that can
happen anywhere in a galaxy. We have laid the groundwork to systematically
search for Ia-TDE candidates in existing and future time-domain surveys. Rapid
characterization of their nature will result in not only the confirmation of a
Ia-TDE, but also the unambiguous discovery of bonafide IMBHs.

$z\leq0.8$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis has been performed to constrain
$b_{\mathrm SZ}$, assuming priors on cosmological parameters from Planck Cosmic

from external data sets to constrain the cosmological parameters
$\Omega_{\mathrm m}$ and $\sigma_8$. We obtained $(1-b_{\mathrm

reconcile primary CMB and cluster count observations. By adopting priors on
$(1-b_{\mathrm SZ})$ from external data sets, we derived results on
$\Omega_{\mathrm m}$ that are fully in agreement and competitive, in terms of

importance of including clustering in cosmological studies, in order to fully
exploit the information from galaxy cluster statistics. On the other hand, we
found that $\sigma_8$ is not constrained.

DYNAMO, an algorithm that constructs low-dimensional manifolds where each point
corresponds to a neural network model, and two points are nearby if the
corresponding neural networks enact similar high-level computational processes.
DYNAMO takes as input a collection of pre-trained neural networks and outputs a
meta-model that emulates the dynamics of the hidden states as well as the
outputs of any model in the collection. The specific model to be emulated is
determined by a model embedding vector that the meta-model takes as input;
these model embedding vectors constitute a manifold corresponding to the given
population of models. We apply DYNAMO to both RNNs and CNNs, and find that the
resulting model embedding spaces enable novel applications: clustering of
neural networks on the basis of their high-level computational processes in a
manner that is less sensitive to reparameterization; model averaging of several
neural networks trained on the same task to arrive at a new, operable neural
network with similar task performance; and semi-supervised learning via
optimization on the model embedding space. Using a fixed-point analysis of
meta-models trained on populations of RNNs, we gain new insights into how
similarities of the topology of RNN dynamics correspond to similarities of
their high-level computational processes.

properties using a dynamic pore network model under steady-state. Two
immiscible fluids A and B flow through the pores between these two types of
grains denoted ""+"" and ""-"". Fluid A is fully wetting and B is fully non-wetting
with respect to ""+"" grains and opposite with ""-"" grains. The direction of the
capillary forces in the links between two ""+"" grains is therefore opposite
compared to that between two ""-"" grains, whereas the capillary forces in the
links between two opposite types of grains average to zero. For a window of
grain occupation probabilities, a percolating regime appears where there is a
high probability of having connected paths with zero capillary forces. Due to
these paths, no minimum threshold pressure is required to start a flow in this
regime. While varying the pressure drop across the porous medium from low to
high in this regime, the relation between the volumetric flow rate and the
pressure drop goes from being linear to a power law with exponent 2.56 to
linear again. Outside the percolation regime, there is a threshold pressure. No
linear regime is observed for low pressure drops. When the pressure drop is
high enough for there to be flow, we find that the flow rate depends on the
excess pressure drop to an exponents around 2.2-2.3. At even higher pressure
drops, the relation is linear. We see no change in exponent for the
intermediate regime at the percolation critical points where the zero-capillary
force paths disappear. We measure the mobility at the percolation threshold at
low pressure drops so that the flow rate versus pressure drop is linear.
Assuming a power law, the mobility is proportional to the difference between
the occupation probability and the critical occupation probability to a power
of around 5.7.

work, we first point out that the tunneling problem is also present for
normalizing flows but is shifted from the sampling to the training phase of the
algorithm. Specifically, normalizing flows often suffer from mode-collapse for
which the training process assigns vanishingly low probability mass to relevant
modes of the physical distribution. This may result in a significant bias when
the flow is used as a sampler in a Markov-Chain or with Importance Sampling. We
propose a metric to quantify the degree of mode-collapse and derive a bound on
the resulting bias. Furthermore, we propose various mitigation strategies in
particular in the context of estimating thermodynamic observables, such as the
free energy.

being integrated into smart grid systems. However, when compared to traditional
energy resources, the unpredictability of renewable energy generation poses
significant challenges for both electricity providers and utility companies.
Furthermore, the large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (such
as PV systems) creates new challenges for energy management in microgrids. To
tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework with two objectives: (i)
combating uncertainty of renewable energy in smart grid by leveraging
time-series forecasting with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) solutions, and (ii)
establishing distributed and dynamic decision-making framework with multi-agent
reinforcement learning using Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
algorithm. The proposed framework considers both objectives concurrently to
fully integrate them, while considering both wholesale and retail markets,
thereby enabling efficient energy management in the presence of uncertain and
distributed renewable energy sources. Through extensive numerical simulations,
we demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly improves the profit of
load serving entities (LSE) by providing a more accurate wind generation
forecast. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that households with PV and
battery installations can increase their profits by using intelligent battery
charge/discharge actions determined by the DDPG agents.

molecular gas around eight young (<10^6 yr), peaked-spectrum radio galaxies.
This has allowed us to trace the interplay between the radio jets and the
surrounding medium. For three of these sources we present new CO(1-0)
observations, obtained with NOEMA. In two targets, we also detected CN lines,
both in emission and absorption. Combining the new observations with already
published data, we discuss the main results obtained. Although we found that a
large fraction of the cold molecular gas is distributed in disc-like rotating
structures, in most of the sources high turbulence and deviations from purely
quiescent gas (including outflows) were observed in the region co-spatial with
the radio continuum emission. This suggests the presence of an interaction
between radio plasma and cold molecular gas. We found that newly born and young
radio jets, even those with low power i.e., P_jet<10^45 erg/s), can drive
massive outflows of cold, molecular gas. The outflows are, however, limited to
the sub-kpc regions and likely short lived. On larger scales (a few kpc), we
observed cases where the molecular gas appears to avoid the radio lobes and,
instead, wraps around them. The results suggest the presence of an evolutionary
sequence, consistent with simulations, where the type of impact of the radio
plasma changes as the jet expands, going from a direct jet-cloud interaction on
sub-kpc scales to a gentler pushing aside of the gas, increasing its turbulence
and likely limiting its cooling. This effect can be mediated by the cocoon of
shocked gas inflated by the jet-cloud interactions. Building larger samples of
young and evolved radio sources for observation at a similar depth and spatial
resolution to test this scenario is now needed and may be possible thanks to
more data becoming available in the growing public archives.

Conversely, the recent measurement of the $W$-boson mass by the CDF

the conflict that may arise in models addressing the unitarity violation. We
demonstrate that one vector-like $SU(2)_L$ doublet with mass of a few TeV

two anomalies, without conflicting with flavour-changing phenomena and
electroweak observables. Moreover, another tension in the value of the Cabibbo

formation models also support this idea. In this study, we revisit the ring
model by performing a number of high-resolution N-body simulations for 10 Myr
of a ring of self-interacting planetesimals, with various radial distributions
of the gas disc. We found that even if all the planetesimals form at ~1 AU in a
minimum mass solar nebula-like disc, the system tends to spread radially as
accretion proceeds, resulting in a system of planetary embryos lacking
mass-concentration at ~1 AU. Modifying the surface density of the gas disc into
a concave shape with a peak at ~1 AU helps to maintain mass concentrated at ~1
AU and solve the radial dispersion problem. We further propose that such a disc
should be short lived (<= 1 Myr) and with a shallower radial gradient in the
innermost region (< 1 AU) than previously proposed to prevent a too-rapid
growth of Earth. Future studies should extend to ~100 Myr the most promising
simulations and address in a self-consistent manner the evolution of the

task that takes an initial bulk structure, and returns the optimized bulk
geometry and magnetic state, including stability under reaction conditions. The
stable bulk structure is the input to a surface chemistry task that enumerates
surfaces up to a user-specified maximum Miller index, computes relaxed surface
energies for those surfaces, and then prioritizes those for subsequent
adsorption energy calculations based on their contribution to the Wulff
construction shape. The workflow handles computational resource constraints
such as limited wall-time as well as automated job submission and analysis. We
illustrate the workflow for oxygen evolution (OER) intermediates on two double
perovskites. WhereWulff nearly halved the number of Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations from ~ 240 to ~ 132 by prioritizing terminations, up to a
maximum Miller index of 1, based on surface stability. Additionally, it
automatically handled the 180 additional re-submission jobs required to
successfully converge 120+ atoms systems under a 48-hour wall-time cluster
constraint. There are four main use cases that we envision for WhereWulff: (1)
as a first-principles source of truth to validate and update a closed-loop
self-sustaining materials discovery pipeline, (2) as a data generation tool,
(3) as an educational tool, allowing users (e.g. experimentalists) unfamiliar
with OER modeling to probe materials they might be interested in before doing
further in-domain analyses, (4) and finally as a starting point for users to
extend with reactions other than OER, as part of a collaborative software

a high-dimensional setting where $n, m \to \infty$. Recent work connects this
problem to spherical integral geometry giving rise to a conjectured sharp
injectivity threshold for $\alpha = \frac{m}{n}$ by studying the expected Euler
characteristic of a certain random set. We adopt a different perspective and
show that injectivity is equivalent to a property of the ground state of the
spherical perceptron, an important spin glass model in statistical physics. By
leveraging the (non-rigorous) replica symmetry-breaking theory, we derive
analytical equations for the threshold whose solution is at odds with that from
the Euler characteristic. Furthermore, we use Gordon's min--max theorem to
prove that a replica-symmetric upper bound refutes the Euler characteristic
prediction. Along the way we aim to give a tutorial-style introduction to key
ideas from statistical physics in an effort to make the exposition accessible
to a broad audience. Our analysis establishes a connection between spin glasses

exposed to air) with an engineered oxide, using a room-temperature process that
leverages Accelerated Neutral Atom Beam (ANAB) technology at 300 mm wafer

tunable energy per atom, which is rastered across the wafer surface. The

confirm thickness and compositional control of the Nb surface oxide by the ANAB

prohibitively expensive, as the estimation of the outer integral has bias
relative to the variance of the inner integrand. For the case where the inner
integrand is only approximately given, additional bias is added to the
estimation of the outer integral. Variance reduction methods, such as
importance sampling, have been used successfully to make computations more

the low-discrepancy sequences simplifies the error analysis of the proposed

attractive for atomic-precision plasma processing applications such as atomic

beam-generated plasma in argon confined by a constant applied magnetic field is
described in this article. Plasma production primarily occurs in the path of
the beam electrons in the center of the chamber. The resulting plasma spreads
out in the chamber through non-ambipolar diffusion with a short-circuit effect
allowing unequal electron and ion fluxes to different regions of the bounding
conductive chamber walls. The cross-field transport of the electrons (and thus
the steady-state characteristics of the plasma) are strongly impacted by the
magnetic field. $T_{e}$ is anisotropic in the electron beam region, but low and
isotropic away from the plasma production zone. The plasma density increases,
and the plasma becomes more confined near the region of production when the
magnetic field strengthens. The magnetic field reduces both electron physical
and energy transport perpendicular to the magnetic field. $T_{e}$ is uniform
along the magnetic field lines and slowly decreases perpendicular to it.
Electrons are less energetic in the sheath regions where the sheath electric
field repels and confines the low-energy electrons from the bulk plasma. Even
though electron and ion densities are similar in the bulk plasma due to
quasi-neutrality, electron and ion fluxes on the grounded chamber walls are
unequal at most locations. Electron confinement by the magnetic field weakens
with increasing pressure, and the plasma spreads out farther from the electron
beam region.

outcome. In general, mean outcome ensures that, if a stable arrangement exists,
agents are close to evenly spaced across fronts, minimizing misallocated

required relaxation time scales for high-mass stars, this finding is an
indication for ongoing star formation in the inner parsec. The proper motion

Cygan et al. (TALG 2022) obtained algorithms with single-exponential running
time $\alpha^{tw} n^{O(1)}$ for connectivity problems parameterized by
treewidth ($tw$) by introducing the cut-and-count-technique, which reduces
connectivity problems to locally checkable counting problems. In addition, the
bases $\alpha$ were proven to be optimal assuming the Strong Exponential-Time
Hypothesis (SETH).
  As only sparse graphs may admit small treewidth, these results do not apply
to graphs with dense structure. A well-known tool to capture dense structure is
the modular decomposition, which recursively partitions the graph into modules
whose members have the same neighborhood outside of the module. Contracting the
modules yields a quotient graph describing the adjacencies between modules.
Measuring the treewidth of the quotient graph yields the parameter
modular-treewidth, a natural intermediate step between treewidth and
clique-width.
  We obtain the first tight running times for connectivity problems
parameterized by modular-treewidth. For some problems the obtained bounds are
the same as relative to treewidth, showing that we can deal with a greater
generality in input structure at no cost in complexity. We obtain the following
randomized algorithms for graphs of modular-treewidth $k$, given an appropriate

Dominating Set can be solved in time $4^k n^{O(1)}$, Connected Vertex Cover can

of lightweight and memory efficient models, using a pre-trained model with a
large capacity (teacher network) to train a smaller model (student network).
Recently, additional variations for knowledge distillation, utilizing
activation maps of intermediate layers as the source of knowledge, have been
studied. Generally, in computer vision applications, it is seen that the
feature activation learned by a higher capacity model contains richer
knowledge, highlighting complete objects while focusing less on the background.
Based on this observation, we leverage the dual ability of the teacher to
accurately distinguish between positive (relevant to the target object) and
negative (irrelevant) areas. We propose a new loss function for distillation,
called angular margin-based distillation (AMD) loss. AMD loss uses the angular
distance between positive and negative features by projecting them onto a
hypersphere, motivated by the near angular distributions seen in many feature
extractors. Then, we create a more attentive feature that is angularly
distributed on the hypersphere by introducing an angular margin to the positive
feature. Transferring such knowledge from the teacher network enables the
student model to harness the higher discrimination of positive and negative
features for the teacher, thus distilling superior student models. The proposed
method is evaluated for various student-teacher network pairs on four public
datasets. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method has advantages in
compatibility with other learning techniques, such as using fine-grained
features, augmentation, and other distillation methods.

Replacing the local part of the self-energy by the DMFT result within this

decision-making across application areas, including clinical trials,

increased desire to use the available adaptively collected datasets to
distinguish whether one arm was more effective than the other, e.g., which
product or treatment was more effective. Unfortunately, existing tools fail to
provide valid inference when data is collected adaptively or require many
untestable and technical assumptions, e.g., stationarity, iid rewards, bounded
random variables, etc. Our paper introduces the design-based approach to
inference for multi-arm bandits, where we condition the full set of potential
outcomes and perform inference on the obtained sample. Our paper constructs
valid confidence intervals for both the reward mean of any arm and the mean
reward difference between any arms in an assumption-light manner, allowing the
rewards to be arbitrarily distributed, non-iid, and from non-stationary
distributions. In addition to confidence intervals, we also provide valid
design-based confidence sequences, sequences of confidence intervals that have
uniform type-1 error guarantees over time. Confidence sequences allow the agent
to perform a hypothesis test as the data arrives sequentially and stop the
experiment as soon as the agent is satisfied with the inference, e.g., the mean
reward of an arm is statistically significantly higher than a desired
threshold.

demonstrate that self-supervision is powerful to learn good representations.
However, naively combining them is far from success. In this paper, we start by
making the empirical observation that a naive joint optimization of CL and MIM
losses leads to conflicting gradient directions - more severe as the layers go
deeper. This motivates us to shift the paradigm from combining loss at the end,
to choosing the proper learning method per network layer. Inspired by
experimental observations, we find that MIM and CL are suitable to lower and
higher layers, respectively. We hence propose to combine them in a surprisingly
simple, ""sequential cascade"" fashion: early layers are first trained under one
MIM loss, on top of which latter layers continue to be trained under another CL
loss. The proposed Layer Grafted Pre-training learns good visual
representations that demonstrate superior label efficiency in downstream
applications, in particular yielding strong few-shot performance besides linear
evaluation. For instance, on ImageNet-1k, Layer Grafted Pre-training yields
65.5% Top-1 accuracy in terms of 1% few-shot learning with ViT-B/16, which
improves MIM and CL baselines by 14.4% and 2.1% with no bells and whistles. The

field in which they are immersed. This phenomenon, being reminiscent of the
Meissner-Ochsenfeld effect in superconductors, is known as the black hole
Meissner effect, and here we study it in the backreacting regime and from the
near horizon perspective. By resorting to methods recently developed in the
literature, which allow to compute conserved charges in the near horizon
region, regardless the details of the asymptotia at large distance, we
investigate the properties of the black hole horizon when in its Meissner
state. We show that, when in such state, the horizon exhibits two sets of
supertranslation symmetries as well as a symmetry generated by the local
conformal group. The supertranslations are generated by two infinite sets of
currents, one of which comes from local dilations of the advanced null
coordinate at the horizon, and the other from local gauge transformations that
preserve the electromagnetic field configuration at the horizon. We show that
the evaluation of the conserved charges associated to these symmetries
correctly reproduce the physical charges of the magnetized black holes and
their thermodynamics. This represents a concrete application of the techniques
developed in [1,2,3] and it extends the results of [4] to arbitrary values of
the black hole charges. In addition, we elaborate on the charges computation at
the horizon: we show the equivalence between the horizon charges and the
evaluation of the corresponding Komar integrals. Besides, we show the validity
of the Gauss phenomenon by explicitly relating near horizon charges with fluxes
and charges computed by other techniques. All this provides a method to derive
the thermodynamics of magnetized horizons in a quite succinct way, including
the case of horizons exhibiting the Meissner effect.

  validated on ASKAP data","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stad1353",,"astro-ph.IM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accompanying Part I, this sequel delineates a validation of the recently
proposed AI for Regularisation in radio-interferometric Imaging (AIRI)
algorithm on observations from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder
(ASKAP). The monochromatic AIRI-ASKAP images showcased in this work are formed
using the same parallelised and automated imaging framework described in Part
I: ``uSARA validated on ASKAP data''. Using a Plug-and-Play approach, AIRI
differs from uSARA by substituting a trained denoising deep neural network
(DNN) for the proximal operator in the regularisation step of the
forward-backward algorithm during deconvolution. We build a trained shelf of
DNN denoisers which target the estimated image-dynamic-ranges of our selected
data. Furthermore, we quantify variations of AIRI reconstructions when
selecting the nearest DNN on the shelf versus using a universal DNN with the
highest dynamic range, opening the door to a more complete framework that not
only delivers image estimation but also quantifies epistemic model uncertainty.
We continue our comparative analysis of source structure, diffuse flux
measurements, and spectral index maps of selected target sources as imaged by
AIRI and the algorithms in Part I -- uSARA and WSClean. Overall we see an
improvement over uSARA and WSClean in the reconstruction of diffuse components
in AIRI images. The scientific potential delivered by AIRI is evident in
further imaging precision, more accurate spectral index maps, and a significant
acceleration in deconvolution time, whereby AIRI is four times faster than its
sub-iterative sparsity-based counterpart uSARA.

of properties of the $X_i$. When the latter are independent, the union bound
(in its various guises) can yield tight upper bounds. If, however, the $X_i$
are strongly dependent, the estimates provided by the union bound will be
rather loose. In this note, we show that for non-negative random variables,
pairwise independence suffices for the maximal inequality to behave comparably
to its independent version. The condition of pairwise independence may be
relaxed to a kind of negative dependence, and even the latter admits violations
-- provided these are properly quantified.

$z=xy$ gives the convex hull over the box domains for $x$ and $y$. In network
applications where the domain of bilinear variables is described by a network
polytope, the McCormick relaxation, also referred to as linearization, fails to
provide the convex hull and often leads to poor dual bounds. We study the
convex hull of the set containing bilinear constraints $z_{i,j}=x_iy_j$ where
$x_i$ represents the arc-flow variable in a network polytope, and $y_j$ is in a
simplex. For the case where the simplex contains a single $y$ variable, we
introduce a systematic procedure to obtain the convex hull of the above set in
the original space of variables, and show that all facet-defining inequalities
of the convex hull can be obtained explicitly through identifying a special
tree structure in the underlying network. For the generalization where the
simplex contains multiple $y$ variables, we design a constructive procedure to
obtain an important class of facet-defining inequalities for the convex hull of
the underlying bilinear set that is characterized by a special forest structure
in the underlying network. Computational experiments are presented to evaluate
the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

star forming and quiescent systems (i.e. galaxies with no or negligible star
formation activity at the epoch of observation). Why, when and how such
bimodality was established, and whether it has been associated with different
processes at different cosmic epochs, is still a key open question in
extragalactic astrophysics. Directly observing early quiescent galaxies in the
primordial Universe is therefore of utmost importance to constraining models of
galaxy formation and transformation. Early quiescent galaxies have been
identified out to redshift $z < 5$, and these are all found to be massive
($M_{*}>10^{10}~M_{\odot}$). Here we report the discovery of a quiescent galaxy
at z$=$7.3, when the Universe was only 700 Myr old - about 5% of its current
age. The JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of this galaxy from our JADES programme exhibits
a complete absence of nebular emission lines, while the Balmer break and
Ly$\alpha$ drop are unambiguously detected. We infer that this galaxy
experienced a short and intense burst of star formation followed by rapid
quenching, about 10-20 Myr before the epoch of observation. Particularly
interesting is that the mass of this quiescent galaxy is only $\sim$4-6$\times
10^8~M_{\odot}$. This mass range is sensitive to various feedback mechanisms
that can result in temporary or permanent quiescence. Therefore this galaxy
represents a unique opportunity to learn more about galaxy formation and
transformation in the early Universe.

interpolate within the design domain between fluid and solid in a continuous
fashion. In density-based methods, the concept of inverse permeability in the

non-fluid regions. This volumetric force consists of a scalar term multiplied
by the fluid velocity. This scalar term takes a value between two limits as
determined by a convex interpolation function. The maximum inverse permeability
limit is typically chosen through a trial and error analysis of the initial

real-world networks (in particular in biological networks) it is usually not
possible to know the exact connection weights. Therefore, it is important to
determine the structural properties of a network necessary to generate
oscillations. Here, we provide a proof that uses dynamical system theory to
prove that an odd number of inhibitory nodes and strong enough connections are
necessary to generate oscillations in a single cycle threshold-linear network.
We illustrate these analytical results in a biologically plausible network with
either firing-rate based or spiking neurons. Our work provides structural
properties necessary to generate oscillations in a network. We use this

FSS) and their Cross-dataset variants where zero to few annotations are needed
to segment novel classes. The existing FSS and ZSS methods utilize fully
supervised pixel-labelled seen classes to segment unseen classes. Pixel-level
labels are hard to obtain, and using weak supervision in the form of
inexpensive image-level labels is often more practical. To this end, we propose
a novel unified weakly supervised OVSS pipeline that can perform ZSS, FSS and
Cross-dataset segmentation on novel classes without using pixel-level labels
for either the base (seen) or the novel (unseen) classes in an inductive
setting. We propose Weakly-Supervised Language-Guided Segmentation Network

generalizable context vectors with batch aggregates (mean) to map class prompts

weak ZSS/FSS into weak semantic segmentation and Zero-Shot segmentation. The
learned context vectors avoid overfitting on seen classes during training and
transfer better to novel classes during testing. WLSegNet avoids fine-tuning

victim objects according to target labels. And then it generates multiple

GLOW, on the one hand, is capable of handling various types of requests,

scoring systems are either vendor-specific, proprietary, or are only

based on vulnerability severity are poor predictors of actual vulnerability
exploitation because they do not incorporate new information that might impact
the likelihood of exploitation. In this paper we present the efforts behind
building a Special Interest Group (SIG) that seeks to develop a completely
data-driven exploit scoring system that produces scores for all known
vulnerabilities, that is freely available, and which adapts to new information.
The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) SIG consists of more than 170

crowd-sourced expertise and feedback. Based on these collective insights, we
describe the design decisions and trade-offs that lead to the development of

driven by space-time L\'evy white noise in a finite-variance setting. Motivated
by recent active research on limit theorems for stochastic partial differential
equations driven by Gaussian noises, we present the first study in this L\'evy
setting. In particular, we first establish the spatial ergodicity of the
solution and then a quantitative central limit theorem (CLT) for the spatial
averages of the solution to HAM in both Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov
distance, with the same rate of convergence. To achieve the first goal (i.e.
spatial ergodicity), we exploit some basic properties of the solution and apply
a Poincar\'e inequality in the Poisson setting, which requires delicate moment
estimates on the Malliavin derivatives of the solution. Such moment estimates
are obtained in a soft manner by observing a natural connection between the
Malliavin derivatives of HAM and a HAM with Dirac delta velocity. To achieve
the second goal (i.e. CLT), we need two key ingredients: (i) a univariate
second-order Poincar\'e inequality in the Poisson setting that goes back to
Last, Peccati, and Schulte (Probab. Theory Related Fields, 2016) and has been
recently improved by Trauthwein (arXiv:2212.03782); (ii) aforementioned moment
estimates of Malliavin derivatives up to second order. We also establish a
corresponding functional central limit theorem by (a) showing the convergence
in finite-dimensional distributions and (b) verifying Kolmogorov's tightness
criterion. Part (a) is made possible by a linearization trick and the
univariate second-order Poincar\'e inequality, while part (b) follows from a
standard moment estimate with an application of Rosenthal's inequality.

Taylor TD uses a first-order Taylor series expansion of TD updates. This
expansion allows to analytically integrate over stochasticity in the

evidence of Taylor TD updates being lower variance than (standard) TD updates.
Additionally, we show that Taylor TD has the same stable learning guarantees as

Taylor TD with the TD3 algorithm (Fujimoto et al., 2018), into TaTD3. We show
TaTD3 performs as well, if not better, than several state-of-the art model-free

Alternatively, fluids with large anisotropic pressure gradients can be handled
macroscopically using the recently developed Viscous Anisotropic Hydrodynamics

matter in solid state systems has instigated a surge of activity investigating
the exotic properties of these unusual materials. Amongst these are transport
signatures which can be attributed to the chiral anomaly; the breaking of
classical chiral symmetry in a quantum theory. This remarkable quantum
phenomenon, first discovered in the context of particle physics has now found
new life in condensed matter physics, connecting topological quantum matter and
band theory with effective field theoretic models. In this paper we investigate
the interplay between interactions and the chiral anomaly in field theories
inspired by semimetals using Fujikawa's path integral method. Starting from
models in one spatial dimension we discuss how the presence of interactions can
affect the consequences of the chiral anomaly leading to renormalization of
excitations and their transport properties. This is then generalised to the
three dimensional case where we show that the anomalous response of the system,
namely the chiral magnetic and quantum hall effects, are modified by the
presence of interactions. These properties are investigated further through the
identification of anomalous modes which exist within interacting Weyl
semimetals. These massive excitations are nonperturbative in nature and are a
direct consequence of the chiral anomaly. The effects of interactions on mixed
axial-gravitational anomalies are then investigated and the conditions required
for interactions effects to be observed are discussed.

($\nu{\bar \nu}\to e^-e^+$) is astrophysically well-motivated because it is a

estimate the gamma-ray energy deposition rate (EDR) arising from the
annihilation of the neutrino pairs in the equatorial plane of a slowly rotating
black hole geometry modified by the broken Lorentz symmetry (induced by a
background bumblebee vector field). More specifically, owing to the presence of
a dimensionless Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter $l$ arising from
nonminimal coupling between the bumblebee field with nonzero vacuum expectation
value and gravity, the metric solution in question differs from the standard
slowly rotating Kerr black hole. By idealizing the thin accretion disk
temperature profile in the two forms of isothermal and gradient around the
bumblebee gravity-based slow rotating black hole, we investigate the influence
of spontaneous LSB on the $\nu{\bar \nu}$-annihilation efficiency. For both
profiles, we find that positive values of LSB parameter $l>0$ induce an
enhancement of the EDR associated with the neutrino-antineutrino annihilation.
Therefore, the process of powering the GRBs jets around bumblebee gravity
modified slowly rotating geometry is more efficient in comparison with standard
metric. Using the observed gamma-ray luminosity associated with different GRBs
types (short, long, and ultra-long), we find, through the analysis of the EDR
in the parameter space $l-a$ ($a^2\ll1$), some allowed ranges for the LSB
parameter $l$.

temperature dependence using both capacitance-voltage and current-voltage
characteristics. We observe a marked discrepancy in the built-in potential
obtained using these two methods at cryogenic temperatures, supporting the
origin for the anomalous behavior of SiGe HBTs as arising from lateral
inhomogeneities in the base-emitter junction potential. This work helps to
identify the physical mechanisms limiting the cryogenic microwave noise
performance of SiGe HBTs.

essential to establish continuous flow of iron and its ores through reactors,
the direct link between agglomeration and chemistry is still contested due to

availability, affordability, and adoption. Most prior work focuses on
availability; the other two aspects have received little attention. In this
paper, we study broadband affordability in the US. Specifically, we focus on
the nature of broadband plans offered by major ISPs across the US. To this end,
we develop a broadband plan querying tool (BQT) that obtains broadband plans
(upload/download speed and price) offered by seven major ISPs for any street
address in the US. We then use this tool to curate a dataset, querying
broadband plans for over 837k street addresses in thirty cities for seven major
wireline broadband ISPs. We use a plan's carriage value, the Mbps of a user's
traffic that an ISP carries for one dollar, to compare plans. Our analysis
provides us with the following new insights: (1) ISP plans vary inter-city.
Specifically, the fraction of census block groups that receive high and low
carriage value plans varies widely by city; (2) ISP plans intra-city are
spatially clustered, and the carriage value can vary as much as 600% within a
city; (3) Cable-based ISPs offer up to 30% more carriage value to users when
competing with fiber-based ISPs in a block group; and (4) Average income in a
block group plays a critical role in dictating who gets a fiber deployment
(i.e., a better carriage value) in the US. While we hope our tool, dataset, and
analysis in their current form are helpful for policymakers at different levels

generalizations of these norms to higher-order tensors is becoming increasingly

Although the two norms are dual to each other, the best known approximation
bound achieved by polynomial-time algorithms for the tensor nuclear norm is
worse than that for the tensor spectral norm. In this paper, we bridge this gap
by proposing deterministic algorithms with the best bound for both tensor
norms. Our methods not only improve the approximation bound for the nuclear
norm, but are also data independent and easily implementable comparing to
existing approximation methods for the tensor spectral norm. The main idea is
to construct a selection of unit vectors that can approximately represent the
unit sphere, in other words, a collection of spherical caps to cover the
sphere. For this purpose, we explicitly construct several collections of
spherical caps for sphere covering with adjustable parameters for different
levels of approximations and cardinalities. These readily available
constructions are of independent interest as they provide a powerful tool for
various decision making problems on spheres and related problems. We believe
the ideas of constructions and the applications to approximate tensor norms can
be useful to tackle optimization problems over other sets such as the binary

exploring various training (i.e., optimization) challenges - in particular,
arriving at poor local minima in the optimization landscape results in a PINN
approximation giving an inferior, and sometimes trivial, solution when solving
forward time-dependent PDEs with no data. This problem is also found in, and in
some sense more difficult, with domain decomposition strategies such as
temporal decomposition using XPINNs. To address this problem, we first enable a
general categorization for previous causality methods, from which we identify a
gap in the previous approaches. We then furnish examples and explanations for
different training challenges, their cause, and how they relate to information
propagation and temporal decomposition. We propose a solution to fill this gap

propagation framework in which any prior method or combination of methods can
be described. Our unified framework moves toward reducing the number of PINN
methods to consider and the implementation and retuning cost for thorough

computational speed-ups by using transfer learning concepts to initialize
subnetworks in the domain and loss tolerance-based propagation for the
subdomains. We formulate a new time-sweeping collocation point algorithm
inspired by the previous PINNs causality literature, which our framework can

reduced-cost collocation point segmentation. Finally, we provide numerical

  charge-informed atomistic modeling",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The simulation of large-scale systems with complex electron interactions
remains one of the greatest challenges for the atomistic modeling of materials.
Although classical force-fields often fail to describe the coupling between
electronic states and ionic rearrangements, the more accurate
\textit{ab-initio} molecular dynamics suffers from computational complexity
that prevents long-time and large-scale simulations, which are essential to
study many technologically relevant phenomena, such as reactions, ion
migrations, phase transformations, and degradation.
  In this work, we present the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph neural Network
(CHGNet) as a novel machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP), using a
graph-neural-network-based force-field to model a universal potential energy
surface. CHGNet is pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic
moments from the Materials Project Trajectory Dataset, which consists of over
10 years of density functional theory static and relaxation trajectories of
$\sim 1.5$ million inorganic structures. The explicit inclusion of magnetic
moments enables CHGNet to learn and accurately represent the orbital occupancy
of electrons, enhancing its capability to describe both atomic and electronic
degrees of freedom. We demonstrate several applications of CHGNet in
solid-state materials, including charge-informed molecular dynamics in
Li$_x$MnO$_2$, the finite temperature phase diagram for Li$_x$FePO$_4$ and Li
diffusion in garnet conductors. We critically analyze the significance of
including charge information for capturing appropriate chemistry, and we
provide new insights into ionic systems with additional electronic degrees of
freedom that can not be observed by previous MLIPs.

that incorporates side information about agent types with the bicriteria goal
of generating high social welfare and high revenue simultaneously. Side
information can come from a variety of sources -- examples include advice from
a domain expert, predictions from a machine-learning model trained on
historical agent data, or even the mechanism designer's own gut instinct -- and
in practice such sources are abundant. In this paper we adopt a prior-free
perspective that makes no assumptions on the correctness, accuracy, or source
of the side information. First, we design a meta-mechanism that integrates
input side information with an improvement of the classical VCG mechanism. The
welfare, revenue, and incentive properties of our meta-mechanism are
characterized by a number of novel constructions we introduce based on the
notion of a weakest competitor, which is an agent that has the smallest impact
on welfare. We then show that our meta-mechanism -- when carefully instantiated
-- simultaneously achieves strong welfare and revenue guarantees that are
parameterized by errors in the side information. When the side information is
highly informative and accurate, our mechanism achieves welfare and revenue
competitive with the total social surplus, and its performance decays
continuously and gradually as the quality of the side information decreases.
Finally, we apply our meta-mechanism to a setting where each agent's type is
determined by a constant number of parameters. Specifically, agent types lie on
constant-dimensional subspaces (of the potentially high-dimensional ambient
type space) that are known to the mechanism designer. We use our meta-mechanism
to obtain the first known welfare and revenue guarantees in this setting.

the sample growth direction introduces an additional path to modify the linear
and nonlinear spectra. In particular, vanishing linear and second order spin
conductivity tensors are achievable under SU(2) symmetry conditions,
characterized by a collinear SO vector field. Additional conditions under which

to the direction of flowing. The second system is an anisotropic 2D free

The accuracy of the reconstructed quantitative maps using dictionary matching
and SSL-QALAS was evaluated by comparing the estimated T1 and T2 values with
those obtained from the reference methods on an ISMRM/NIST phantom. The
SSL-QALAS and the dictionary matching methods were also compared in vivo, and
generalizability was evaluated by comparing the scan-specific, pre-trained, and

a strong linear agreement with the reference values in the ISMRM/NIST phantom.
Further, SSL-QALAS showed similar performance with dictionary matching in
reconstructing the T1, T2, PD, and IE maps on in vivo data. Rapid
reconstruction of multiparametric maps was enabled by inferring the data using
a pre-trained SSL-QALAS model within 10 s. Fast scan-specific tuning was also
demonstrated by fine-tuning the pre-trained model with the target subject's

mesh. For a given pose, we first build and subdivide a base mesh, which is a
deformed SMPL template, and then estimate Laplacian coordinates for the mesh
vertices using the surface function. The final reconstruction for the pose is
obtained by integrating the estimated Laplacian coordinates as a whole.
Experimental results show that our approach based on Laplacian coordinates
successfully reconstructs more visually pleasing shape details than previous
methods. The approach also enables various surface detail manipulations, such
as detail transfer and enhancement.

achieving a high rate, a high-performance alternating optimization (AO) method

is proposed, where the optimization problem is decomposed to three subproblems
solved by CCT-SDP and rank-one solutions can be recovered by Gaussian
randomization. While the optimization variables in CCT-SDP method are matrices,
which leads to extremely high complexity. In order to reduce the complexity, a
low-complexity AO scheme based on Dinkelbachs transformation and successive
convex approximation (DT-SCA) is put forward, where matrices variables are
transformed to vector variables and three decoupled subproblems are solved by
DT-SCA. Simulation results verify that compared to two benchmarks (i.e. a

demonstrate that the complex Langevin method (CLM) may overcome this issue. We
apply the CLM to the Yang-Mills (YM) type one-dimensional matrix model (matrix

shows a large-$N$ phase transition at finite temperature, which is analogous to
the confinement/deconfinement transition of the original YM theory, and our CLM
predicts that the transition temperature decreases as the angular momentum
chemical potential increases. In order to verify our results, we compute
several quantities via the minimum sensitivity method and find good
quantitative agreements. Hence, the CLM properly works in this rotating system.
We also argue that our results are qualitatively consistent with a holography

byproduct, we develop an analytic approximation to treat the so-called ``small

manipulation, and the recent progress of consumer-grade RGB-D sensors enables
delivering more comprehensive features from both the texture and shape

with much stronger noise compared to RGB images, making it challenging to

paper proposes a novel learning based approach to RGB-D grasp detection, namely
Depth Guided Cross-modal Attention Network (DGCAN). To better leverage the
geometry information recorded in the depth channel, a complete 6-dimensional
rectangle representation is adopted with the grasp depth dedicatedly considered
in addition to those defined in the common 5-dimensional one. The prediction of
the extra grasp depth substantially strengthens feature learning, thereby
leading to more accurate results. Moreover, to reduce the negative impact
caused by the discrepancy of data quality in two modalities, a Local
Cross-modal Attention (LCA) module is designed, where the depth features are
refined according to cross-modal relations and concatenated to the RGB ones for
more sufficient fusion. Extensive simulation and physical evaluations are
conducted and the experimental results highlight the superiority of the

aerial tracking applications. This paper proposes QP Chaser, a trajectory
planning pipeline that can enhance the visibility of single- and dual-target in
both static and dynamic environments. As the name suggests, the proposed
planner generates a target-visible trajectory via quadratic programming
problems. First, the predictor forecasts the reachable sets of moving objects
with a sample-and-check strategy considering obstacles. Subsequently, the
trajectory planner reinforces the visibility of targets with consideration of
1) path topology and 2) reachable sets of targets and obstacles. We define a
target-visible region (TVR) with topology analysis of not only static obstacles
but also dynamic obstacles, and it reflects reachable sets of moving targets
and obstacles to maintain the whole body of the target within the camera image
robustly and ceaselessly. The online performance of the proposed planner is
validated in multiple scenarios, including high-fidelity simulations and
real-world experiments.

Social learning, which uses cues from experts, can greatly benefit from the
usage of explicit communication to align heterogeneous policies, reduce sample

type of explicit communication, studies the creation of an artificial language
to encode a high task-utility message directly from data. However, in most
cases, emergent communication sends insufficiently compressed messages with
little or null information, which also may not be understandable to a
third-party listener. This paper proposes an unsupervised method based on the
information bottleneck to capture both referential complexity and task-specific
utility to adequately explore sparse social communication scenarios in
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We show that our model is able to i)
develop a natural-language-inspired lexicon of messages that is independently
composed of a set of emergent concepts, which span the observations and intents

great potential for screening and diagnosis of this disease. The segmentation

both spatial proximity and textual relevance have been extensively studied.
Existing indexes designed for spatial keyword queries are mostly built based on
the geo-textual data without considering the distribution of queries already

distribution can improve the index structure for future query processing. In
this paper, we propose WISK, a learned index for spatial keyword queries, which

the transient behavior of the flow during the rotation of the double
compression ramp from a single ramp is not fully investigated. The present
paper aims to numerically investigate the transient shock reflection phenomenon
over a rotating double wedge. The problem will start with a 3-Mach number
inviscid flow over a single wedge. Then, a portion of the wedge will be rotated
upstream at a quite low trailing Mach number to avoid the significant lag
effect in the shock waves system. This idea could be applied in the supersonic
intake or extensionally in the hypersonic intake of scramjets with a somehow
complex mechanism. Further, the length of the rotating portion of the wedge

results show a high gain in the pressure due to the rotation of the wedge.
Moreover, the wave angles were larger at the low chord ratio value of $w_2/w_i=

angle, $\theta_2$, resulting in a higher pressure distribution.

  Decomposition Over MIMO Channels","31 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed tensor decomposition (DTD) is a fundamental data-analytics
technique that extracts latent important properties from high-dimensional
multi-attribute datasets distributed over edge devices. Conventionally its
wireless implementation follows a one-shot approach that first computes local
results at devices using local data and then aggregates them to a server with
communication-efficient techniques such as over-the-air computation (AirComp)
for global computation. Such implementation is confronted with the issues of
limited storage-and-computation capacities and link interruption, which
motivates us to propose a framework of on-the-fly communication-and-computing
(FlyCom$^2$) in this work. The proposed framework enables streaming computation
with low complexity by leveraging a random sketching technique and achieves
progressive global aggregation through the integration of progressive uploading
and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) AirComp. To develop FlyCom$^2$, an
on-the-fly sub-space estimator is designed to take real-time sketches
accumulated at the server to generate online estimates for the decomposition.
Its performance is evaluated by deriving both deterministic and probabilistic
error bounds using the perturbation theory and concentration of measure. Both
results reveal that the decomposition error is inversely proportional to the
population of sketching observations received by the server. To further rein in
the noise effect on the error, we propose a threshold-based scheme to select a
subset of sufficiently reliable received sketches for DTD at the server.
Experimental results validate the performance gain of the proposed selection
algorithm and show that compared to its one-shot counterparts, the proposed
FlyCom$^2$ achieves comparable (even better in the case of large eigen-gaps)
decomposition accuracy besides dramatically reducing devices' complexity costs.

information of a LiDAR and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), is an attractive
solution for pose estimation and mapping. In LI-OAM, both pose and velocity are
regarded as state variables that need to be solved. However, the widely-used
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm can only provide constraint for pose,
while the velocity can only be constrained by IMU pre-integration. As a result,
the velocity estimates inclined to be updated accordingly with the pose
results. In this paper, we propose LIW-OAM, an accurate and robust
LiDAR-inertial-wheel odometry and mapping system, which fuses the measurements
from LiDAR, IMU and wheel encoder in a bundle adjustment (BA) based
optimization framework. The involvement of a wheel encoder could provide
velocity measurement as an important observation, which assists LI-OAM to
provide a more accurate state prediction. In addition, constraining the
velocity variable by the observation from wheel encoder in optimization can
further improve the accuracy of state estimation. Experiment results on two

constantly proposed, the robustness evaluations of existing methods are often
inadequate due to their rapid development, diverse noise patterns, and simple
evaluation metrics. Without thorough robustness evaluations, it is hard to
understand the advances in the field and identify the effective methods. In
this paper, we establish a comprehensive robustness benchmark called
\textbf{ARES-Bench} on the image classification task. In our benchmark, we
evaluate the robustness of 55 typical deep learning models on ImageNet with
diverse architectures (e.g., CNNs, Transformers) and learning algorithms (e.g.,
normal supervised training, pre-training, adversarial training) under numerous
adversarial attacks and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. Using robustness
curves as the major evaluation criteria, we conduct large-scale experiments and

adversarial training effectively improves adversarial robustness, especially

off-manifold adversarial examples, as a special case of data augmentation, can
be used to improve OOD generalization. Inspired by this, we theoretically prove
that on-manifold adversarial examples can better benefit OOD generalization.
Nevertheless, it is nontrivial to generate on-manifold adversarial examples
because the real manifold is generally complex. To address this issue, we
proposed a novel method of Augmenting data with Adversarial examples via a
Wavelet module (AdvWavAug), an on-manifold adversarial data augmentation
technique that is simple to implement. In particular, we project a benign image
into a wavelet domain. With the assistance of the sparsity characteristic of
wavelet transformation, we can modify an image on the estimated data manifold.
We conduct adversarial augmentation based on AdvProp training framework.
Extensive experiments on different models and different datasets, including

entropy to the situations in which both the initial and final state are

that the backpropagation of SNNs through the temporal domain contributes just a

proposed method reduces the number of scalar multiplications and achieves a
small memory occupation that is independent of the total time steps.
Furthermore, we propose a variant of SLTT, called SLTT-K, that allows
backpropagation only at K time steps, then the required number of scalar
multiplications is further reduced and is independent of the total time steps.
Experiments on both static and neuromorphic datasets demonstrate superior
training efficiency and performance of our SLTT. In particular, our method

tasks while retaining the knowledge of previous tasks. However, efficiently
fine-tuning the model for sequential tasks with minimal computational resources
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose Task Incremental Continual
Learning (TI-CL) of audio classifiers with both parameter-efficient and
compute-efficient Audio Spectrogram Transformers (AST). To reduce the trainable
parameters without performance degradation for TI-CL, we compare several
Parameter Efficient Transfer (PET) methods and propose AST with Convolutional
Adapters for TI-CL, which has less than 5% of trainable parameters of the fully
fine-tuned counterparts. To reduce the computational complexity, we introduce a
novel Frequency-Time factorized Attention (FTA) method that replaces the
traditional self-attention in transformers for audio spectrograms. FTA achieves
competitive performance with only a factor of the computations required by
Global Self-Attention (GSA). Finally, we formulate our method for TI-CL, called
Adapter Incremental Continual Learning (AI-CL), as a combination of the
""parameter-efficient"" Convolutional Adapter and the ""compute-efficient"" FTA.
Experiments on ESC-50, SpeechCommandsV2 (SCv2), and Audio-Visual Event (AVE)
benchmarks show that our proposed method prevents catastrophic forgetting in
TI-CL while maintaining a lower computational budget.

LiDAR-based place recognition methods are usually based on representations of

influenced by rotations and translations of point clouds. We validate that,
without any delicate design, a simple VGGNet trained on BEV images achieves
comparable performance with the state-of-the-art place recognition methods in
scenes of slight viewpoint changes. For more robust place recognition, we
design a rotation-invariant network called BEVPlace. We use group convolution
to extract rotation-equivariant local features from the images and NetVLAD for
global feature aggregation. In addition, we observe that the distance between
BEV features is correlated with the geometry distance of point clouds. Based on
the observation, we develop a method to estimate the position of the query

representations, is a crucial step in automated machine learning (AutoML)
systems. However, the existing systems often have a very small search space for
feature preprocessing with the same preprocessing pipeline applied to all the
numerical features. This may result in sub-optimal performance since different
datasets often have various feature characteristics, and features within a

we explore personalized preprocessing pipeline search, where the search
algorithm is allowed to adopt a different preprocessing pipeline for each

exponentially with more features. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ClusterP3S, a novel framework for Personalized Preprocessing Pipeline Search

the features within a cluster. To this end, we propose a hierarchical search
strategy to jointly learn the clusters and search for the optimal pipelines,
where the upper-level search optimizes the feature clustering to enable better
pipelines built upon the clusters, and the lower-level search optimizes the
pipeline given a specific cluster assignment. We instantiate this idea with a
deep clustering network that is trained with reinforcement learning at the
upper level, and random search at the lower level. Experiments on benchmark

processes relevant to air, sea, and land vehicle performance and numerous other

contribute to fundamental transformations in the flow field. Precise control of
these disturbances is possible by introducing a phononic subsurface (PSub).
This comprises locally attaching a finite phononic structure perpendicular to
an elastic surface exposed to the flowing fluid. This structure experiences
ongoing excitation by an unstable flow mode traveling in conjunction with the
mean flow. The excitation generates small deformations at the surface that
trigger elastic wave propagation within the structure. By targeted tuning of
the unit-cell and finite-structure characteristics of the PSub, the returning
waves may be devised to resonate and reenter the flow out of phase, leading to
significant destructive interference of the incoming flow waves near the
surface and subsequently to their attenuation over the spatial extent of the
control region. This control mechanism is passive, responsive, and engineered
offline without needing coupled fluid-structure simulations; only the flow
instability's frequency, wavelength, and overall modal characteristics must be
known. We present a PSub in the form of a locally resonant elastic
metamaterial, designed to operate in the elastic subwavelength regime and hence
being significantly shorter in length compared to a phononic-crystal-based
PSub. Using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of channel flows, both types of
PSubs are investigated, and their controlled spatial and energetic influence on
the wall-bounded flow behavior is demonstrated and analyzed. We show that the
PSub's effect is spatially localized as intended, with a rapidly diminishing
streamwise influence away from its location in the subsurface.

perception requiring additional effort in software such as image stabilization.
This effect is particularly pronounced in micro-air vehicles and micro-robots
who typically are lighter and subject to larger jitter but do not have the
computational capability to perform stabilization in real-time. We present a
novel microelectromechanical (MEMS) mirror LiDAR system to change the field of
view of the LiDAR independent of the robot motion. Our design has the potential
for use on small, low-power systems where the expensive components of the LiDAR
can be placed external to the small robot. We show the utility of our approach
in simulation and on prototype hardware mounted on a UAV. We believe that this
LiDAR and its compact movable scanning design provide mechanisms to decouple
robot and sensor geometry allowing us to simplify robot perception. We also
demonstrate examples of motion compensation using IMU and external odometry
feedback in hardware.

discriminative representation by deep learning, due to limited data. Generally
speaking, the model will get better performance when increasing the amount of
data. The addition of similar classes strengthens the ability of the classifier
to identify similar identities, thereby improving the discrimination of
representation. In this paper, we propose a Diverse and Compact Transformer
(DC-Former) that can achieve a similar effect by splitting embedding space into
multiple diverse and compact subspaces. Compact embedding subspace helps model
learn more robust and discriminative embedding to identify similar classes. And
the fusion of these diverse embeddings containing more fine-grained information
can further improve the effect of re-ID. Specifically, multiple class tokens
are used in vision transformer to represent multiple embedding spaces. Then, a
self-diverse constraint (SDC) is applied to these spaces to push them away from
each other, which makes each embedding space diverse and compact. Further, a
dynamic weight controller(DWC) is further designed for balancing the relative
importance among them during training. The experimental results of our method
are promising, which surpass previous state-of-the-art methods on several

While promising for object-level surfaces, these methods suffer when coping

Kuramoto and the Winfree models resemble each other for symmetric bimodal

macroscopic dynamical states and bistable regions. The dynamical transitions in
the bistable states are characterized by an abrupt (first-order) transition in
both the forward and reverse traces. For asymmetric bimodal frequency
distribution, the onset of bistable regions depends on the degree of the
asymmetry. Large degree of the symmetry breaking coupling strength promotes the
synchronized stationary state, while a large degree of heterogeneity,
proportional to the separation between the two central frequencies, facilitates
the spread of the incoherent and standing wave states in the phase diagram for
a low strength of the symmetry breaking coupling. We deduce the low-dimensional
equations of motion for the complex order parameters using the Ott-Antonsen
ansatz for both unimodal and bimodal frequency distributions. We also deduce
the Hopf, pitchfork, and saddle-node bifurcation curves from the evolution

the issue of various graph-structured related tasks, such as node
classification and graph classification. However, extensive research has shown
that GCNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. One of the security threats
facing GCNs is the backdoor attack, which hides incorrect classification rules
in models and activates only when the model encounters specific inputs
containing special features (e.g., fixed patterns like subgraphs, called
triggers), thus outputting incorrect classification results, while the model
behaves normally on benign samples. The semantic backdoor attack is a type of
the backdoor attack where the trigger is a semantic part of the sample; i.e.,
the trigger exists naturally in the original dataset and the attacker can pick
a naturally occurring feature as the backdoor trigger, which causes the model
to misclassify even unmodified inputs. Meanwhile, it is difficult to detect
even if the attacker modifies the input samples in the inference phase as they
do not have any anomaly compared to normal samples. Thus, semantic backdoor
attacks are more imperceptible than non-semantic ones. However, existed

domains, which have not been well explored against GCNs. In this work, we
propose a black-box Semantic Backdoor Attack (SBA) against GCNs. We assign the
trigger as a certain class of nodes in the dataset and our trigger is semantic.
Through evaluation on several real-world benchmark graph datasets, the
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed SBA can achieve almost 100%
attack success rate under the poisoning rate less than 5% while having no
impact on normal predictive accuracy.

destruction. That being said, it's of utmost importance to preserve them by
identifying the existent, or presumptive, defects using novel methods so that
renovation processes can be done in a timely manner and with higher accuracy.
The main goal of this research is to use new deep learning (DL) methods in the
process of preserving CHBs (situated in Iran); a goal that has been neglected
especially in developing countries such as Iran, as these countries still
preserve their CHBs using manual, and even archaic, methods that need direct
human supervision. Having proven their effectiveness and performance when it
comes to processing images, the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a
staple in computer vision (CV) literacy and this paper is not exempt. When
lacking enough CHB images, training a CNN from scratch would be very difficult
and prone to overfitting; that's why we opted to use a technique called
transfer learning (TL) in which we used pre-trained ResNet, MobileNet, and
Inception networks, for classification. Even more, the Grad-CAM was utilized to
localize the defects to some extent. The final results were very favorable
based on those of similar research. The final proposed model can pave the way
for moving from manual to unmanned CHB conservation, hence an increase in
accuracy and a decrease in human-induced errors.

challenge of task grounding in addition to object grounding to enable
task-oriented grasp prediction with visual-language inputs. Evaluation on a

Jagiellonian Positron Emission Tomography (J-PET) scanner for intra-treatment
proton beam range monitoring. Approach: The Monte Carlo simulation studies with
GATE and PET image reconstruction with CASToR were performed in order to
compare six J-PET scanner geometries (three dual-heads and three cylindrical).
We simulated proton irradiation of a PMMA phantom with a Single Pencil Beam
(SPB) and Spread-Out Bragg Peak (SOBP) of various ranges. The sensitivity and
precision of each scanner were calculated, and considering the setup's
cost-effectiveness, we indicated potentially optimal geometries for the J-PET
scanner prototype dedicated to the proton beam range assessment. Main results:
The investigations indicate that the double-layer cylindrical and triple-layer
double-head configurations are the most promising for clinical application. We
found that the scanner sensitivity is of the order of 10$^{-5}$ coincidences
per primary proton, while the precision of the range assessment for both SPB
and SOBP irradiation plans was found below 1 mm. Among the scanners with the
same number of detector modules, the best results are found for the
triple-layer dual-head geometry. Significance: We performed simulation studies
demonstrating that the feasibility of the J-PET detector for PET-based proton
beam therapy range monitoring is possible with reasonable sensitivity and
precision enabling its pre-clinical tests in the clinical proton therapy
environment. Considering the sensitivity, precision and cost-effectiveness, the
double-layer cylindrical and triple-layer dual-head J-PET geometry

using deep video inpainting (VI) algorithms has attracted considerable
attention. Usually, a video sequence and object segmentation masks for all
frames are required as the input for this task. However, in real-world
applications, providing segmentation masks for all frames is quite difficult
and inefficient. Therefore, we deal with VI in a one-shot manner, which only
takes the initial frame's object mask as its input. Although we can achieve
that using naive combinations of video object segmentation (VOS) and VI
methods, they are sub-optimal and generally cause critical errors. To address
that, we propose a unified pipeline for one-shot video inpainting (OSVI). By
jointly learning mask prediction and video completion in an end-to-end manner,
the results can be optimal for the entire task instead of each separate module.
Additionally, unlike the two stage methods that use the predicted masks as
ground truth cues, our method is more reliable because the predicted masks can
be used as the network's internal guidance. On the synthesized datasets for
OSVI, our proposed method outperforms all others both quantitatively and
qualitatively.

(via time-dependent spectral density of incoherent photons) for generation of
single-qubit gates for a two-level open quantum system which evolves according
to the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation with
time-dependent coefficients determined by these coherent and incoherent
controls. The control problem is formulated as minimization of the objective
functional, which is the sum of Hilbert-Schmidt norms between four fixed basis
states evolved under the GKSL master equation with controls and the same four
states evolved under the ideal gate transformation. The exact expression for
the gradient of the objective functional with respect to piecewise constant
controls is obtained. Subsequent optimization is performed using a gradient
type algorithm with an adaptive step size that leads to oscillating behaviour
of the gradient norm vs iterations. Optimal trajectories in the Bloch ball for
various initial states are computed. A relation of quantum gate generation with
optimization on complex Stiefel manifolds is discussed. We develop methodology
and apply it here for unitary gates as a testing example. The next step is to

large screen with haptic feedback. The local participant can reach his hand out
to the screen and perform hand clapping with the remote participant as if the
two participants were only separated by a virtual glass. A key challenge in
emulating the remote hand touch is the realistic rendering of the participant's
hand and arm as the hand touches the screen. When the hand is very close to the
screen, the RGBD data required for realistic rendering is no longer available.
To tackle this challenge, we present a dual representation of the user's hand.
Our dual representation not only preserves the high-quality rendering usually
found in recent image-based rendering systems but also allows the hand to reach
the screen. This is possible because the dual representation includes both an
image-based model and a 3D geometry-based model, with the latter driven by a
hand skeleton tracked by a side view camera. In addition, the dual
representation provides a distance-based fusion of the image-based and 3D
geometry-based models as the hand moves closer to the screen. The result is
that the image-based and 3D geometry-based models mutually enhance each other,
leading to realistic and seamless rendering. Our experiments demonstrate that
our method provides consistent hand contact experience between remote users and

historical development of CAD. Basically, it has answered the question of what
geometric information a computer should store and how to store/manipulate them
in order for the computer to aid the processes of design and manufacturing.
This paper provides a brief review (in Chinese) on the historical development
of solid modeling, its fundamental research problems, as well as their

interacted with the protons of the liquid hydrogen target CRYPTA, to produce
tritons $t$ that were detected in the MUST2 detector array, in coincidence with
the heavy residues Ca or Ar. The atomic mass of $^{35}$Ca and the energy of its

demonstrated its effectiveness in solving high-dimensional problems, especially
in domains such as games. Despite its potential, RL is still not widely used
for turbulence modeling and is primarily used for flow control and optimization
purposes. A new RL wall model (WM) called VYBA23 is developed in this work,
which uses agents dispersed in the flow near the wall. The model is trained on
a single Reynolds number ($Re_\tau = 10^4$) and does not rely on high-fidelity
data, as the back-propagation process is based on a reward rather than output
error. The states of the RLWM, which are the representation of the environment
by the agents, are normalized to remove dependence on the Reynolds number. The
model is tested and compared to another RLWM (BK22) and to an equilibrium wall
model, in a half-channel flow at eleven different Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau
\in [180;10^{10}]$). The effects of varying agents' parameters such as actions
range, time-step, and spacing are also studied. The results are promising,
showing little effect on the average flow field but some effect on wall-shear
stress fluctuations and velocity fluctuations. This work offers positive
prospects for developing RLWMs that can recover physical laws, and for
extending this type of ML models to more complex flows in the future.

bit is the parity bit, i.e., the output of the systematic error-correcting
code. As a result, sign-bit shaping has been used with multilevel coded
modulations rather than BICM. In this paper, we show that with minor
modifications it is possible to use sign-bit-like shaping with a BICM.

topologically protected spin structures. However, traditional ferromagnetic

hindering their usage in spintronics. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions,
consisting of two FM solitons coupled antiferromagnetically, are predicted to
have a zero Magnus force, making them promising candidates for spintronic
racetrack memories. Currently, they have been stabilized in synthetic AFM
structures, i.e. multilayers hosting FM skyrmions, which couple

underlying phase diagrams by accounting for the interplay between the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and Heisenberg exchange interactions, as well as the

been well studied under the one-dimensional parametric models. It is often
reported that TS is fairly insensitive to the choice of the prior when it comes
to regret bounds. However, this property is not necessarily true when
multiparameter models are considered, e.g., a Gaussian model with unknown mean
and variance parameters. In this paper, we first extend the regret analysis of
TS to the model of uniform distributions with unknown supports. Specifically,
we show that a switch of noninformative priors drastically affects the regret
in expectation. Through our analysis, the uniform prior is proven to be the
optimal choice in terms of the expected regret, while the reference prior and
the Jeffreys prior are found to be suboptimal, which is consistent with
previous findings in the model of Gaussian distributions. However, the uniform
prior is specific to the parameterization of the distributions, meaning that if
an agent considers different parameterizations of the same model, the agent
with the uniform prior might not always achieve the optimal performance. In
light of this limitation, we propose a slightly modified TS-based policy,
called TS with Truncation (TS-T), which can achieve the asymptotic optimality
for the Gaussian distributions and the uniform distributions by using the
reference prior and the Jeffreys prior that are invariant under one-to-one
reparameterizations. The pre-processig of the posterior distribution is the key
to TS-T, where we add an adaptive truncation procedure on the parameter space
of the posterior distributions. Simulation results support our analysis, where
TS-T shows the best performance in a finite-time horizon compared to other
known optimal policies, while TS with the invariant priors performs poorly.

specific class of objective functions, called the benefit functions, based on
observational and interventional data -- assuming a fully specified model is
not available to evaluate these functions. We complement this line of work by
proposing the first exact algorithm for finding optimal units given a broad
class of causal objective functions and a fully specified structural causal
model (SCM). We show that unit selection under this class of objective
functions is $\text{NP}^\text{PP}$-complete but is $\text{NP}$-complete when
unit variables correspond to all exogenous variables in the SCM. We also
provide treewidth-based complexity bounds on our proposed algorithm while
relating it to a well-known algorithm for Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference.

compare against a variety of baselines designed for adding color to 3D, such as
exhaustively adding per-pixel features or RGB values in an implicit manner. We
leverage Predator [25] as the baseline method and incorporate our proposed

different 2D pre-trained networks and show a positive correlation between the
pre-trained weights and the task performance. Our experimental results indicate
a significant improvement of 6.5% registration recall over the baseline method

gravitational radius of a contracting shell is larger than the radius of the
inner boundary, energy transfer occurs due to the intersection with the other
expanding shell before the contracting shell becomes a black hole, resulting
nonlinearly stable motion. The system appears to be in a permanently stable
periodic motion due to the repetition of forward and reverse energy transfer.
The larger the specific energy of a shell, the more stable the motion is. In
addition, the motion of the null shell as the fastest limit of the timelike
shell is also investigated. Unlike the timelike shell, the motion of the two
null shells reduces to exact recurrence equations. By analyzing the recurrence
equations, we find the null shells also allow stable motions. Using the

  Since understanding genetic drift is crucial for an optimal parameter choice,
we extend the known quantitative analysis of genetic drift to EDAs for

diagnostics proposed for SPIDER upgrade, a heterodyne microwave (mw)
interferometer at 100 GHz is being explored as a possibility to measure
electron density in the plasma extraction region. The major issue in applying
this technique in SPIDER is the poor accessibility of the probing microwave
beam through the source metal walls and the long distance of 4 m at which mw
modules should be located outside the vacuum vessel. Numerical investigations
in a full-scale geometry showed that the power transmitted through the plasma
source apertures was sufficient for the microwave module sensitivity. An
experimental proof-of-principle of the setup was then performed. The microwave
system was tested on an experimental full-scale test-bench mimicking SPIDER
viewports accessibility constraints, including the presence of a SPIDER-like
plasma. The outcome of first tests revealed that, despite the geometrical
constraints, in certain conditions, the electron density measurements are
possible. The main issue arises from decoupling the one-pass signal from
spurious multipaths generated by mw beam reflections, requiring signal cross
correlation analysis. These preliminary tests demonstrate that despite the 4 m
distance between the mw modules and the presence of metal walls, plasma density
measurement is possible when the 80-mm diameter ports are available. In this

linked to that of the circumplanetary disk (CPD) in which they form. The CPD
accretes material from the surrounding circumstellar disk in the vicinity of
the planet, however, the degree of chemical inheritance is unclear. We aim to
investigate the composition of ices in chemically reset or inherited
circumplanetary disks to inform interior modeling and the interpretation of in
situ measurements of icy solar system satellites, with an emphasis on the
Galilean moon system. We used a radiation-thermochemical code to produce
circumplanetary disk models and extract the ice composition from time-dependent
chemistry, incorporating gas-phase and grain-surface reactions. The initial
sublimation of ices during accretion may result in a CO2-rich ice composition.
Sublimated ammonia ice is destroyed by background radiation while drifting
towards the CPD midplane. Liberated nitrogen becomes locked in N2 due to
efficient self-shielding, leaving ices depleted of ammonia. A significant
ammonia ice component remains only when ices are inherited from the
circumstellar disk. The observed composition of the Galilean moons is
consistent with the sublimation of ices during accretion onto the CPD. In this
scenario, the Galilean moon ices are nitrogen-poor and CO2 on Callisto is
endogenous and primordial. The ice composition is significantly altered after
an initial reset of accreted circumstellar ice. The chemical history of the
Galilean moons stands in contrast to the Saturnian system, where the
composition of the moons corresponds more closely with the directly inherited
circumstellar disk material.

While some solutions exist to mitigate power and bandwidth demands for data

finding the best tradeoff in practice. This paper sets up the infrastructure to
assess at-scale a key power and bandwidth optimization - weight clustering -
for You Only Look Once v3 (YOLOv3), a neural network-based object detection
system, using videos of real driving conditions. Our assessment shows that
accelerators such as systolic arrays with an Output Stationary architecture
turn out to be a highly effective solution combined with weight clustering. In
particular, applying weight clustering independently per neural network layer,
and using between 32 (5-bit) and 256 (8-bit) weights allows achieving an
accuracy close to that of the original YOLOv3 weights (32-bit weights). Such
bit-count reduction of the weights allows shaving bandwidth requirements down
to 30%-40% of the original requirements, and reduces energy consumption down to
45%. This is based on the fact that (i) energy due to multiply-and-accumulate
operations is much smaller than DRAM data fetching, and (ii) designing
accelerators appropriately may make that most of the data fetched corresponds
to neural network weights, where clustering can be applied. Overall, our
at-scale assessment provides key results to architect camera-based object
detection accelerators by putting together a real-life application (YOLOv3),

for MAE $vs.$ 300 epochs for the supervised), and 2) the high uncertainty and
inconsistency of the pre-trained model, \ie, the prediction of the same patch
may be inconsistent under different mask rounds. To tackle these problems, we
propose efficient masked autoencoders with self-consistency (EMAE), to improve
the pre-training efficiency and increase the consistency of MIM. In particular,
we progressively divide the image into K non-overlapping parts, each of which
is generated by a random mask and has the same mask ratio. Then the MIM task is
conducted parallelly on all parts in an iteration and generates predictions.
Besides, we design a self-consistency module to further maintain the
consistency of predictions of overlapping masked patches among parts. Overall,
the proposed method is able to exploit the data more efficiently and obtains
reliable representations. Experiments on ImageNet show that EMAE achieves even
higher results with only 300 pre-training epochs under ViT-Base than MAE (1600

nanoribbons changes upon variations of the bond length between edge atoms and
their distance from passivating species. Our DFT calculations indicate that the
gap of C-based nanoribbons is more sensitive to the relaxation of the bonding
length between edge atoms (morphology) whereas in BN-nanorribons it is more
sensitive to the distance between edge atoms and passivating hydrogens

we propose a novel point cloud completion approach namely ProxyFormer that
divides point clouds into existing (input) and missing (to be predicted) parts
and each part communicates information through its proxies. Specifically, we
fuse information into point proxy via feature and position extractor, and
generate features for missing point proxies from the features of existing point
proxies. Then, in order to better perceive the position of missing points, we
design a missing part sensitive transformer, which converts random normal
distribution into reasonable position information, and uses proxy alignment to
refine the missing proxies. It makes the predicted point proxies more sensitive
to the features and positions of the missing part, and thus make these proxies
more suitable for subsequent coarse-to-fine processes. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art completion networks on
several benchmark datasets and has the fastest inference speed. Code is

In this paper, we propose a cross-domain recommendation method: Self-supervised

we perform two levels of cross-domain contrastive learning: 1)
instance-to-instance contrastive learning, 2) instance-to-cluster contrastive
learning. Not only that, we also take into account users' multi-granularity and
multi-view interests. With this paradigm, SITN can explicitly learn the
invariant knowledge of interest clusters between domains and accurately capture
users' intents and preferences. We conducted extensive experiments on a public
dataset and a large-scale industrial dataset collected from one of the world's
leading e-commerce corporations. The experimental results indicate that SITN
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art recommendation methods.
Additionally, SITN has been deployed on a micro-video recommendation platform,
and the online A/B testing results further demonstrate its practical value.

properties of quasicrystals are different from those of conventional solids. An
anomalous increase in heat capacity at high temperatures has been discussed for
over two decades as a manifestation of a hidden high dimensionality of
quasicrystals. A plausible candidate for this origin has been phason, which has
excitation modes originating from additional degrees of freedom in the
higher-dimensional lattice. However, most theoretical studies on phasons have
used toy models. A theoretical study of the heat capacity of realistic
quasicrystals or their approximants has yet to be conducted because of the huge

show experiments and molecular simulations on the same material, an Al--Pd--Ru

transverse spin angular momentum (TSAM), which arises due to the longitudinal
component of the electromagnetic field generated by tight focusing, is of
special interest, both in terms of fundamental studies and associated
applications. We provide an effective and optimal strategy for generating TSAM
in optical tweezers by tightly focusing radially and azimuthally polarized
first-order Laguerre Gaussian beams with no intrinsic angular momentum, into a
refractive index stratified medium. Our choice of such input fields ensures
that the longitudinal spin angular momentum (LSAM) arising from the electric
(magnetic) field for the radial (azimuthal) component is zero, which leads to
the separate and exclusive effects of the electric and magnetic TSAM in the
case of input radially and azimuthally polarized beams on single birefringent
particles. We also observe the emergence of origin-dependent intrinsic orbital
angular momentum causing the rotation of birefringent particles around the beam
axis for both input beam types, which opens up new and simple avenues for
exotic and complex particle manipulation in optical tweezers.

which encode changes of illumination for each pixel independently and
asynchronously. While they output temporally rich information, they lack any
depth information which could facilitate their use with other sensors. LiDARs
can provide this depth information, but are by nature very sparse, which makes
the depth-to-event association more complex. Furthermore, as events represent
changes of illumination, they might also represent changes of depth;
associating them with a single depth is therefore inadequate. In this work, we
propose to address these issues by fusing information from an event camera and
a LiDAR using a learning-based approach to estimate accurate dense depth maps.
To solve the ""potential change of depth"" problem, we propose here to estimate
two depth maps at each step: one ""before"" the events happen, and one ""after""
the events happen. We further propose to use this pair of depths to compute a
depth difference for each event, to give them more context. We train and
evaluate our network, ALED, on both synthetic and real driving sequences, and
show that it is able to predict dense depths with an error reduction of up to
61% compared to the current state of the art. We also demonstrate the quality
of our 2-depths-to-event association, and the usefulness of the depth

design a multi-step selection strategy to find useful base data. Specifically,
we first discover the base images which contain the FP of novel categories and
select a certain amount of samples from them for the base and novel categories
balance. Then the bad cases, such as the base images that have unlabeled ground
truth or easily confused base instances, are removed by using CLIP. Finally,
the same category strategy is adopted, in which a novel instance with category
n is pasted on the base image with the FP of n. During combination, a novel
instance is cropped and randomly down-sized, and thus pasted at the assigned
optimal location from the randomly generated candidates in a selected base

making energy efficiency (EE) the main performance indicator for IoT hardware
and software. With respect to network design, this implies in developing
energy-efficient communication protocols and network architectures adapted to
the ubiquitousness of the IoT machine-type devices (MTDs) and the sporadic
traffic generated by them, keeping a low power consumption at the MTDs-side. In
this sense, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have presented the
capacity of significantly improving the network coverage using mostly passive
reflecting elements, drastically reducing the power expenditure. In this paper,
we develop a realistic power consumption model and an expression for the
overall system EE for RIS-aided IoT networks that adopt a two time-scale random
access (RA) protocol to handle the uplink transmissions. Specifically, during
each time slot of the RA protocol, the RIS covers a specific area of interest
in the communication cell with a predefined set of phase-shift configurations,
changing the channel qualities of the contending MTDs. Numerical results
comparing the RA protocol performance reveal that access policies that exploit
information of the channel qualities are suitable for green IoT networks,
simultaneously attaining competitive EE and throughput combined with low power
consumption at the MTDs-side.

degradation of interference visibility due to the finite polarization
extinction ratio becomes a problem. Here we propose a method to optimize
interference visibility by controlling the polarizations to a crosspoint of two
circular trajectories on the Poincar\'{e} sphere. Our method maximizes
visibility with low optical loss, which is essential for quantum light, by
using fiber stretchers as polarization controllers. We also experimentally
demonstrate our method, where the visibility was maintained basically above
99.9% for three hours using fiber stretchers with an optical loss of 0.02 dB
(0.5%). Our method makes fiber systems promising for practical fault-tolerant

calls for optimization in terms of magnetic softness and magnetostriction for
its use in magnetoresistive sensor applications. Conventional annealing methods
are often insufficient to locally achieve the desired properties for a narrow
parameter range. In this study, we report a significant improvement of the
magnetic softness and magnetostriction in a 30 nm Permalloy film after He$^+$
irradiation. Compared to the as-deposited state, the irradiation treatment
reduces the induced anisotropy by a factor ten and the hard axis coercivity by
a factor five. In addition, the effective magnetostriction of the film is
significantly reduced by a factor ten - below $1\times10^{-7}$ - after
irradiation. All the above mentioned effects can be attributed to the isotropic
crystallite growth of the Ni-Fe alloy and to the intermixing at the magnetic
layer interfaces under light ion irradiation. We support our findings with
X-ray diffraction analysis of the textured Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$ alloy.
Importantly, the sizable magnetoresistance is preserved after the irradiation.
Our results show that compared to traditional annealing methods, the use of
He$^+$ irradiation leads to significant improvements in the magnetic softness
and reduces strain cross sensitivity in Permalloy films required for 3D
positioning and compass applications. These improvements, in combination with
the local nature of the irradiation process make our finding valuable for the
optimization of monolithic integrated sensors, where classic annealing methods
cannot be applied due to complex interplay within the components in the device.

consumption, which restricts the development of deep learning as well as
increases carbon emissions. Thus, the study of energy-efficient training for
DNNs is essential. In training, the linear layers consume the most energy
because of the intense use of energy-consuming full-precision (FP32)
multiplication in multiply-accumulate (MAC). The energy-efficient works try to
decrease the precision of multiplication or replace the multiplication with
energy-efficient operations such as addition or bitwise shift, to reduce the
energy consumption of FP32 multiplications. However, the existing
energy-efficient works cannot replace all of the FP32 multiplications during
both forward and backward propagation with low-precision energy-efficient
operations. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Layer-wise Scaling PoT
Quantization (ALS-POTQ) method and a Multiplication-Free MAC (MF-MAC) to
replace all of the FP32 multiplications with the INT4 additions and 1-bit XOR
operations. In addition, we propose Weight Bias Correction and Parameterized
Ratio Clipping techniques for stable training and improving accuracy. In our
training scheme, all of the above methods do not introduce extra
multiplications, so we reduce up to 95.8% of the energy consumption in linear

less than 1% for CNN models on ImageNet and Transformer model on the WMT En-De

  Architecture (ICSA'23)",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Software Architecture, from definition to maintenance and evolution, is a
complex aspect of software development and, consequently, a challenging subject
when it comes to teaching it, and learning it.
  Many research efforts have been devoted to designing teaching approaches,
strategies and tools. Most of them, however, focus on the knowledge itself and
the ways to convey it to students, rather than on the different learning styles
of students themselves.
  Teaching methods which predominantly rely on verbal and written
communication, are very well aligned with some learning styles. However,
students with learning styles that benefit more from physical activity or
first-hand experience, need to defer to cognitive processes that are less
natural to them.
  In this work, we propose an innovative use of role-playing as teaching
strategy for architecture models of reference (i.e. layered, pipe and filter,
client-server, etc.). This role-playing of different software architectures, in
which students play the part of specific components in the system, intends to
complement other classical teaching materials, such as in-person or recorded
lectures, lab assignments, or development projects.
  Addressing all learning styles within a classroom is key to ensure that we
favour and foster the students' different learning processes, and give everyone
an even playfield in which to best develop their capabilities as Software
Architects.

depth error caused by internal stray light in amplitude-modulated continuous
wave (AMCW) coaxial scanning light detection and ranging (LiDAR). Assuming that
the internal stray light generated in the process of emitting laser is static,
the amplitude and phase delay of internal stray light are estimated using the
Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and particle swarm optimization (PSO).
Specifically, the pixel positions in a raw signal amplitude map of calibration
checkboard are segmented by GMM with two clusters considering the dark and
bright image pattern. The loss function is then defined as L1-norm of
difference between mean depths of two amplitude-segmented clusters. To avoid
overfitting at a specific distance in PSO process, the calibration check board
is actually measured at multiple distances and the average of corresponding L1
loss functions is chosen as the actual loss. Such loss is minimized by PSO to
find the two optimal target parameters: the amplitude and phase delay of
internal stray light. According to the validation of the proposed algorithm,
the original loss is reduced from tens of centimeters to 3.2 mm when the
measured distances of the calibration checkboard are between 1 m and 4 m. This
accurate calibration performance is also maintained in geometrically complex
measured scene. The proposed internal stray light calibration algorithm in this
paper can be used for any type of AMCW coaxial scanning LiDAR regardless of its
optical characteristics.

of a Health Wellness Coaching (HWC) intervention on improvement of
cardiovascular health at 9 months post randomization and in three consecutive
3-month periods over 9 months post randomization. Conventional approaches,
including instrumental variable models, are not applicable in the presence of
multiple correlated multivalued exposures and unmeasured confounding. We
propose a causal framework and its Bayesian modelling procedures to identify
and estimate average effects of one or multiple multivalued exposures on one
outcome in the presence of unmeasured confounding, noncompliance and missing
data, in a two-arm randomized trial. We also propose estimation methods of
unmeasured confounders, where the exposure and outcome distributions are
conditional on unmeasured confounders and then unmeasured confounders are
imputed as completely missing variables. Several types of model
non-identifiability and possible solutions are described. There is a risk that
estimation methods of unmeasured confounders can fail when multiple
contradictory posterior solutions are produced. The random intercept outcome
models that only adjust for unmeasured confounding in the outcome distribution
are proposed as a good surrogate causal model in this case, and they need
further development.
  There is evidence that the HWC intervention is beneficial to cardiovascular
health at 9 months post randomization. On average, completing one HWC session
improves the Life's Simple Seven total score by 0.16 (0.09, 0.22) and reduces
systolic blood pressure by 0.54 (0.19, 0.90) mm Hg. There is also evidence that
the HWC intervention has a larger beneficial effect on cardiovascular health
during 3 months post randomization. There is no clear evidence that the HWC
intervention benefits or harms mental health. The complete abstract is in the

TV-watching companion robot with open-domain chat ability. The robot contains
two modes: TV-watching mode and conversation mode. In TV-watching mode, the
robot first extracts keywords from the TV program and then generates the
disclosure utterances based on the extracted keywords as if enjoying the TV
program. In the conversation mode, the robot generates question utterances with
keywords in the same way and then employs a topics-based dialog management
method consisting of multiple dialog engines for rich conversations related to
the TV program. We conduct the initial experiments and the result shows that
all participants from the three groups enjoyed talking with the robot, and the
question about their interests in the robot was rated 6.5/7-levels. This
indicates that the proposed conversational features of TV-watching Companion
Robot have the potential to make our daily lives more enjoyable. Under the
analysis of the initial experiments, we achieve further experiments with more
participants by dividing them into two groups: a control group without a robot
and an intervention group with a robot. The results show that people prefer to
talk to robots because the robot will bring more enjoyable, relaxed, and
interesting.

interactions between agents, for example in Robust AI or Privacy-preserving AI.
Integrating bilevel mathematical programming within deep learning is thus an
essential objective for the Machine Learning community. Previously proposed
approaches only consider single-level programming. In this paper, we extend
existing single-level optimization programming approaches and thus propose
Differentiating through Bilevel Optimization Programming (BiGrad) for
end-to-end learning of models that use Bilevel Programming as a layer. BiGrad
has wide applicability and can be used in modern machine learning frameworks.
BiGrad is applicable to both continuous and combinatorial Bilevel optimization
problems. We describe a class of gradient estimators for the combinatorial case
which reduces the requirements in terms of computation complexity; for the case
of the continuous variable, the gradient computation takes advantage of the
push-back approach (i.e. vector-jacobian product) for an efficient
implementation. Experiments show that the BiGrad successfully extends existing
single-level approaches to Bilevel Programming.

to boost fine-grained classification through a hierarchical approach via
learnable independent query embeddings. This is achieved through a
classification network that uses coarse class predictions to improve the fine
class accuracy in a stage-wise sequential manner. We exploit the idea of
hierarchy to learn query embeddings that are scalable across all levels, thus
making this a relevant approach even for extreme classification where we have a
large number of classes. The query is initialized with a weighted Eigen image
calculated from training samples to best represent and capture the variance of
the object. We introduce transformer blocks to fuse intermediate layers at
which query attention happens to enhance the spatial representation of feature
maps at different scales. This multi-scale fusion helps improve the accuracy of
small-size objects. We propose a two-fold approach for the unique
representation of learnable queries. First, at each hierarchical level, we
leverage cluster based loss that ensures maximum separation between inter-class
query embeddings and helps learn a better (query) representation in higher
dimensional spaces. Second, we fuse coarse level queries with finer level
queries weighted by a learned scale factor. We additionally introduce a novel
block called Cross Attention on Multi-level queries with Prior (CAMP) Block
that helps reduce error propagation from coarse level to finer level, which is
a common problem in all hierarchical classifiers. Our method is able to
outperform the existing methods with an improvement of ~11% at the fine-grained

challenge, mainly because thermal noise prevents them from retaining short-term
memory, the essence of neuromorphic computing. Here, we propose a framework for
spintronic physical reservoirs that exploits frequency domain dynamics in
interacting spins. Through the effective use of frequency filters, we
demonstrate, for a model of frustrated magnets, both robustness to thermal
fluctuations and feasibility of frequency division multiplexing. This scheme
can be coupled with parallelization in spatial domain even down to the level of
a single spin, yielding a vast number of spatiotemporal computational units.
Furthermore, the nonlinearity via the exchange interaction allows information
processing among different frequency threads. Our findings establish a design
principle for high-performance spintronic reservoirs with the potential for
highly integrated devices.

Although many backdoor detection methods exist, most of them assume that the

where the defender is the maintainer of model-sharing platforms. Thus, in this

of various rescue units (e.g., medical, fire, \& police forces), the rescue
units would ideally be allocated quickly and distributedly while aiming to
minimize casualties. This is one of many examples of distributed settings with
service providers (the rescue units) and service requesters (the emergencies)

providers in a distributed manner while aiming for a global optimum is hard to
model, let alone achieve, using the existing Distributed Constraint
Optimization Problem (DCOP) framework. Hence, the need for a novel approach and
corresponding algorithms.
  We present the Service Oriented Multi-Agent Optimization Problem (SOMAOP), a
new framework that overcomes the shortcomings of DCOP in service oriented
settings. We evaluate the framework using various algorithms based on auctions
and matching algorithms (e.g., Gale Shapely). We empirically show that
algorithms based on repeated auctions converge to a high quality solution very
fast, while repeated matching problems converge slower, but produce higher
quality solutions. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach over standard
incomplete DCOP algorithms and a greedy centralized algorithm.

the learning processes of agents in reinforcement learning. MDP is limited by
the Markovian assumption that a reward only depends on the immediate state and
action. However, a reward sometimes depends on the history of states and
actions, which may result in the decision process in a non-Markovian
environment. In such environments, agents receive rewards via
temporally-extended behaviors sparsely, and the learned policies may be
similar. This leads the agents acquired with similar policies generally overfit
to the given task and can not quickly adapt to perturbations of environments.
To resolve this problem, this paper tries to learn the diverse policies from
the history of state-action pairs under a non-Markovian environment, in which a
policy dispersion scheme is designed for seeking diverse policy representation.
Specifically, we first adopt a transformer-based method to learn policy
embeddings. Then, we stack the policy embeddings to construct a dispersion
matrix to induce a set of diverse policies. Finally, we prove that if the
dispersion matrix is positive definite, the dispersed embeddings can
effectively enlarge the disagreements across policies, yielding a diverse
expression for the original policy embedding distribution. Experimental results
show that this dispersion scheme can obtain more expressive diverse policies,
which then derive more robust performance than recent learning baselines under
various learning environments.

surrogate model, mostly with a simple stationary and separable kernel function
such as the squared-exponential kernel with automatic relevance determination
(SE-ARD). However, such simple kernel specifications are deficient in learning
functions with complex features, such as being nonstationary, nonseparable, and
multimodal. Approximating such functions using a local GP, even in a
low-dimensional space, requires a large number of samples, not to mention in a
high-dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose to use Bayesian Kernelized
Tensor Factorization (BKTF) -- as a new surrogate model -- for BO in a
$D$-dimensional Cartesian product space. Our key idea is to approximate the
underlying $D$-dimensional solid with a fully Bayesian low-rank tensor CP
decomposition, in which we place GP priors on the latent basis functions for
each dimension to encode local consistency and smoothness. With this
formulation, information from each sample can be shared not only with neighbors
but also across dimensions. Although BKTF no longer has an analytical
posterior, we can still efficiently approximate the posterior distribution
through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and obtain prediction and full
uncertainty quantification (UQ). We conduct numerical experiments on both
standard BO test functions and machine learning hyperparameter tuning problems,

cooperate to minimize a global objective function, expressed as a sum of local
objectives, subject to some constraints. In DO, each agent iteratively solves a
local optimization model constructed by its own data and communicates some
information (e.g., a local solution) with its neighbors until a global solution
is obtained. Even though locally stored data are not shared with other agents,
it is still possible to reconstruct the data from the information communicated
among agents, which could limit the practical usage of DO in applications with
sensitive data. To address this issue, we propose a privacy-preserving DO
algorithm for constrained convex optimization models, which provides a
statistical guarantee of data privacy, known as differential privacy, and a
sequence of iterates that converges to an optimal solution in expectation. The
proposed algorithm generalizes a linearized alternating direction method of
multipliers by introducing a multiple local updates technique to reduce
communication costs and incorporating an objective perturbation method in the
local optimization models to compute and communicate randomized feasible local
solutions that cannot be utilized to reconstruct the local data, thus
preserving data privacy. Under the existence of convex constraints, we show
that, while both algorithms provide the same level of data privacy, the
objective perturbation used in the proposed algorithm can provide better
solutions than does the widely adopted output perturbation method that
randomizes the local solutions by adding some noise. We present the details of
privacy and convergence analyses and numerically demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm by applying it in two different applications, namely,
distributed control of power flow and federated learning, where data privacy is

recommender systems mainly focus on improving model architecture or
incorporating additional information, neglecting the importance of training
schemes. This work revisits the training framework and uncovers two major
problems hindering the expressiveness of learned multi-interest
representations. First, the current training objective (i.e., uniformly sampled
softmax) fails to effectively train discriminative representations in a
multi-interest learning scenario due to the severe increase in easy negative
samples. Second, a routing collapse problem is observed where each learned
interest may collapse to express information only from a single item, resulting
in information loss. To address these issues, we propose the REMI framework,
consisting of an Interest-aware Hard Negative mining strategy (IHN) and a
Routing Regularization (RR) method. IHN emphasizes interest-aware hard
negatives by proposing an ideal sampling distribution and developing a
Monte-Carlo strategy for efficient approximation. RR prevents routing collapse
by introducing a novel regularization term on the item-to-interest routing
matrices. These two components enhance the learned multi-interest
representations from both the optimization objective and the composition
information. REMI is a general framework that can be readily applied to various
existing multi-interest candidate matching methods. Experiments on three
real-world datasets show our method can significantly improve state-of-the-art
methods with easy implementation and negligible computational overhead. The
source code will be released.

different radius would be a clear sign of hadron-quark phase transition in
nuclear matter. Motivated by studies searching for significant deviations in
the observables of twin stars, we investigate the differences that manifest in
their r-mode instability windows and spin-down evolution. Firstly, we obtain a
set of hybrid equations of state (which predict the existence of a third stable
branch of compact objects) by employing the well-known Maxwell construction,
within the phenomenological framework of constant speed of sound
parametrization. Then, we systematically study the influence of certain
parameters, such as the energy density jump (in the resulting hybrid equation
of state) and the crust elasticity, on the deviations between the r-mode
instability windows and spin-down evolution of twin stars. We conclude that two
stars with identical mass and fairly similar spin frequency and temperature,
may behave differently with respect to r-modes. Thus, the future possible
detection of gravitational waves (due to unstable r-modes) from a star laying
in the stable region of the frequency-temperature plane would be a strong
indication for the existence of twin stars. Furthermore, we consider current
data for the spin frequencies and temperatures of observed pulsars and compare
them to the predictions made from equations of state employed in this study. We
find that, depending on the transition density and the rigidness of the crust,
hybrid equations of state may be a viable solution for the explanation of
existing data.

mediate lepton number violating processes, including neutrinoless double beta
decay. The Higgs sector is composed of two Higgs doublets $H_L$, $H_R$, and a
bi-doublet $\Phi$. The fermion sector has the usual for the L-R symmetric
models quarks and leptons, along with three $SU(2)$ singlet fermion $S_{\gamma

large Majorana masses for the heavy RH neutrinos leading to two sets of heavy
Majorana particles $N_j$ and $S_k$, $j,k=1,2,3$, with masses $m_{N_j} \ll
m_{S_k}$. Working with a specific version of the model in which the
$\nu_{\alpha L} - N_{\beta R}$ and the $N_{\beta R} - S_{\gamma L}$ Dirac mass
terms are diagonal, and assuming that $m_{N_j} \sim (1 - 1000)$ GeV and ${\rm

in both cases of NO and IO light neutrino mass spectra, these contributions are
strongly enhanced and are dominant at relatively small values of the lightest

behavior for low fields and low temperatures which is consistent with the
magnetic scattering results. The magnetization measurements show a deviation
from the Curie-Weiss behavior below $\approx 150\,\rm K$, the temperature below

""Wide-gap CdTe strip detector"", in which the gap between adjacent strips is
much wider than the width of each strip. It has been known that the observed
energies of an incoming photon in adjacent strips can be utilized to achieve a
position resolution finer than the strip pitch, if and only if the charge cloud
induced by an incoming X-ray photon is split into multiple strips and their
energies are accurately measured. However, with existing CdTe strip detectors,
the ratio of such charge-sharing events is limited. An idea for a potential
breakthrough to greatly enhance the ratio of charge-sharing events is to widen
the gaps between strips on the detector. To test the concept, we developed a
wide-gap CdTe strip detector, which has 64 platinum strip electrodes on the
cathode side with some variations in strip pitches from 60 um (30 um strip and
30 um gap width) to 80 um (30 um strip and 50 um gap width). We evaluated the
performance depending on the strip pitches by irradiating X-rays from Am-241 on
the detector. The charge loss due to the wider gaps on the detector was found
to be significant to the extent that the assumption that the energy of an
incoming photon for a charge-sharing event was the simple sum of the energies
detected in adjacent strips lead to a significant degradation in the energy
resolution in the accumulated spectrum, compared with those obtained with its
predecessor having standard gap-widths. We then developed a new
energy-reconstruction method to compensate for the charge loss. Application of
the method to the data yielded a spectrum with a comparable spectral resolution
with that of the predecessor. The ratio of the charge-sharing events for 17.8
keV events was doubled from that of the predecessor, from 24.3 to 49.9 percent.

compositional proof calculus is presented that modularly verifies CHPs
including their parallel compositions from proofs of their subprograms by
assumption-commitment reasoning in dynamic logic. Unlike Hoare-style
assumption-commitments, $d\mathcal{L}_\text{CHP}$ supports intuitive symbolic
execution via explicit recorder variables for communication primitives. Since
$d\mathcal{L}_\text{CHP}$ is a conservative extension of differential dynamic
logic $d\mathcal{L}$, it can be used soundly along with the $d\mathcal{L}$
proof calculus and $d\mathcal{L}$'s complete axiomatization for differential
equation invariants.

composition or the strain in the material is a major approach for the design of
optoelectronic materials. Experimental approaches screening a large range of
possible target structures are hampered by the tremendous effort to optimize
the material synthesis for every target structure. We present an approach based
on density functional theory efficiently capable of providing the bandgap as a
function of composition and strain. Using a specific density functional
designed for accurate bandgap computation (TB09) together with a band unfolding
procedure and special quasirandom structures, we develop a computational
protocol efficiently able to predict bandgaps. The approach's accuracy is
validated by comparison to selected experimental data. We thus map the phase
space of composition and strain (we call this the 'bandgap phase diagram') for
several important III-V compound semiconductors: GaAsP, GaAsN, GaPSb, GaAsSb,
GaPBi, and GaAsBi. We show the application of these diagrams for identifying
the most promising materials for device design. Furthermore, our computational
protocol can easily be generalized to explore the vast chemical space of III-V
materials with all other possible combinations of III- and V-elements.

However, even basic static type checking of DS pipelines is difficult because
most are written in Python. Static typing is available in Python only via
external linters. These require static type annotations for parameters or
results of functions, which many DS libraries do not provide. In this paper, we
show how the wealth of Python DS libraries can be used in a statically safe way
via Safe-DS, a domain specific language (DSL) for DS. Safe-DS catches
conventional type errors plus errors related to range restrictions, data
manipulation, and call order of functions, going well beyond the abilities of
current Python linters. Python libraries are integrated into Safe-DS via a stub
language for specifying the interface of its declarations, and an API-Editor
that is able to extract type information from the code and documentation of
Python libraries, and automatically generate suitable stubs.
  Moreover, Safe-DS complements textual DS pipelines with a graphical
representation that eases safe development by preventing syntax errors. The
seamless synchronization of textual and graphic view lets developers always
choose the one best suited for their skills and current task. We think that
Safe-DS can make DS development easier, faster, and more reliable,
significantly reducing development costs.

to have a small value (in the sense that $J/M<<1$) and then study the
conditions for thermodynamical equilibrium; only then take the $J\rightarrow 0$
limit. We calculate the black hole's angular momentum fluctuations which turn
out to have two independent contributions: one that comes from the black hole
itself, with no respect to the radiation, and another one that arises from the
radiation. The result is astonishingly simple: the radiation contribution
depends exclusively on the cut-off proper distance from the horizon (or
equivalently, the width of the brick wall), while the black hole contribution
is proportional to its event horizon area. Accordingly, there are no strictly
static black holes in nature, they randomly rotate in all possible directions.
Since a black hole is nothing but geometry, we are dealing with geometry
fluctuations -- our results are of quantum-gravitational nature (albeit at a
semi-classical level). Interestingly enough, if we apply to the black hole
fluctuations component the (quantum) rules of angular momentum we obtain an
event horizon area quantization rule, albeit with a different spectrum from an
equally spaced area spectrum which is widely accepted in the literature.

particularly since they allow to selectively execute parts of the pipeline.
However, notebooks for DS have many well-known flaws. We focus on the following
ones in this paper: (1) Notebooks can become littered with code cells that are
not part of the main DS pipeline but exist solely to make decisions (e.g.
listing the columns of a tabular dataset). (2) While users are allowed to
execute cells in any order, not every ordering is correct, because a cell can
depend on declarations from other cells. (3) After making changes to a cell,
this cell and all cells that depend on changed declarations must be rerun. (4)
Changes to external values necessitate partial re-execution of the notebook.
(5) Since cells are the smallest unit of execution, code that is unaffected by
changes, can inadvertently be re-executed.
  To solve these issues, we propose to replace cells as the basis for the
selective execution of DS pipelines. Instead, we suggest populating a
context-menu for variables with actions fitting their type (like listing
columns if the variable is a tabular dataset). These actions are executed based
on a data-flow analysis to ensure dependencies between variables are respected
and results are updated properly after changes. Our solution separates pipeline
code from decision making code and automates dependency management, thus
reducing clutter and the risk of making errors.

resemble its ideal fluid counterpart only if constructed in terms of the
available form of Bernoulli function as per Lorenz theory of available

controllers for deterministic systems modelled by ordinary differential
equations and stochastic systems modeled by stochastic differential equations
based on the notion of control guidance-barrier functions. We begin with
considering deterministic systems. Given an open safe set, a target set and a
nominal controller, we attempt to synthesize a reach-avoid controller, which
modifies the nominal controller in a minimal way enforcing the reach-avoid
objective, i.e., the system will enter the target set eventually while staying
inside the safe set before the first target hitting time. Three control
guidance-barrier functions are developed and three corresponding conditions for
synthesizing reach-avoid controllers are constructed, which get progressively
weaker and thus facilitate the optimal controller design. The first and second
ones are termed exponential and asymptotic control guidance-barrier functions,
which guarantee that every trajectory starting from the safe set will enter the
target set respectively at an exponential rate and in an asymptotic way.
However, it is observed that these two control guidance-barrier functions have
one condition in common of enforcing invariance of its every positive sublevel
set until the system enters the target set, which is strict and thus limits the
space of admissible controllers. Consequently, a lax control guidance-barrier
function is further developed such that only the safe set set is an invariance
before the system enters the target set, expanding the space of admissible
control inputs. Then, we extend the methodologies for deterministic systems to
stochastic systems, which synthesize reach-avoid controllers in the
probabilistic setting. Finally, several numerical examples demonstrate the
performance of proposed methods.

  Applications (IEEE ICMLA)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Active learning is a practical field of machine learning that automates the
process of selecting which data to label. Current methods are effective in
reducing the burden of data labeling but are heavily model-reliant. This has
led to the inability of sampled data to be transferred to new models as well as
issues with sampling bias. Both issues are of crucial concern in machine
learning deployment. We propose active learning methods utilizing combinatorial
coverage to overcome these issues. The proposed methods are data-centric, as
opposed to model-centric, and through our experiments we show that the
inclusion of coverage in active learning leads to sampling data that tends to
be the best in transferring to better performing models and has a competitive
sampling bias compared to benchmark methods.

this end, we study the time evolution of several observables in the anisotropic

degrees of freedom, yet it has smaller Hilbert space and thus allows for
numerical studies of larger systems. We compare the field disorder that breaks
the Z_2 spin symmetry and a potential disorder that preserves the latter
symmetry. In the former case, sufficiently strong disorder leads to
localization of all studied observables, at least for the studied system sizes.
However, in the case of symmetry-preserving disorder, we observe that odd
operators under the Z_2 spin transformation relax towards the equilibrium value
at relatively short time scales that grow only polynomially with the disorder
strength. On the other hand, the dynamics of even operators and the level
statistics within each symmetry sector are consistent with localization. Our
results indicate that localization exists within each symmetry sector for
symmetry preserving disorder. Odd operators' apparent relaxation is due to
their time evolution between distinct symmetry sectors.

believe that for many practical applications, exploration should be
contextualised with semantic and object-level understanding of the environment

objects in unknown space as well as reconstructing them to a target level of
detail. We therefore extend our environment reconstruction to not only consist
of a background map, but also object-level and semantically fused submaps.
Importantly, we adapt our previous objective function of uncovering as much
free space as possible in as little time as possible with two additional
elements: first, we require a maximum observation distance of background
surfaces to ensure target objects are not missed by image-based detectors
because they are too small to be detected. Second, we require an even smaller
maximum distance to the found objects in order to reconstruct them with the
desired accuracy. We further created a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) semantic

be taken into account. In contrast, person re-identification is often improved
by architectural changes that come at the cost of significantly slowing down

well-performing attention blocks used in the state of the art are subject to
inference costs that are far too high to justify their use for mobile robotic

under user interaction. For this task, most of the current deep learning
(DL)-based methods mainly follow the general pipelines of semantic

explicitly utilize and propagate the click information, inevitably leading to
unsatisfactory segmentation results, even at clicked points. Against this
issue, in this paper, we propose to formulate the IS task as a Gaussian process
(GP)-based pixel-wise binary classification model on each image. To solve this

intractable GP posterior in a data-driven manner and then decouple the
approximated GP posterior into double space forms for efficient sampling with
linear complexity. Then, we correspondingly construct a GP classification
framework, named GPCIS, which is integrated with the deep kernel learning
mechanism for more flexibility. The main specificities of the proposed GPCIS
lie in: 1) Under the explicit guidance of the derived GP posterior, the
information contained in clicks can be finely propagated to the entire image
and then boost the segmentation; 2) The accuracy of predictions at clicks has
good theoretical support. These merits of GPCIS as well as its good generality
and high efficiency are substantiated by comprehensive experiments on several

update the node features by aggregating their neighbors' information without
considering the interaction of joints in different motion patterns. Although
some studies import limb information to learn the movement patterns, the latent
synergies among joints, such as maintaining balance in the motion are seldom
investigated. We propose a hop-wise GraphFormer with intragroup joint
refinement (HopFIR) to tackle the 3D HPE problem. The HopFIR mainly consists of
a novel Hop-wise GraphFormer(HGF) module and an Intragroup Joint
Refinement(IJR) module which leverages the prior limb information for
peripheral joints refinement. The HGF module groups the joints by $k$-hop
neighbors and utilizes a hop-wise transformer-like attention mechanism among
these groups to discover latent joint synergy. Extensive experimental results
show that HopFIR outperforms the SOTA methods with a large margin (on the
Human3.6M dataset, the mean per joint position error (MPJPE) is 32.67mm).
Furthermore, it is also demonstrated that previous SOTA GCN-based methods can
benefit from the proposed hop-wise attention mechanism efficiently with

environment as an unobserved stochastic process and investigate how the mutual
information between internal degrees of freedom encodes internal and
environmental processes, and how it can help us disentangle them. Then, we
attempt to build effective representations via information-preserving
projections that preserve the dependencies of a complex system. In the
paradigmatic case of underdamped systems, we find that optimal effective
representations may be unexpectedly singular, revealing fundamental limits of
approximating complex models. In the second part of this Thesis, we apply these
approaches and ideas from criticality to neural systems at different scales,
showing that unobserved neural activity may lead to power-law neuronal
avalanches in the absence of criticality. Remarkably, the properties of mutual

modulation, interactions between neural populations are at the source of
scale-free correlations. We further explore the role of the structure of

  Representation","Accepted by CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Discriminative representation is essential to keep a unique identifier for
each target in Multiple object tracking (MOT). Some recent MOT methods extract
features of the bounding box region or the center point as identity embeddings.
However, when targets are occluded, these coarse-grained global representations
become unreliable. To this end, we propose exploring diverse fine-grained
representation, which describes appearance comprehensively from global and
local perspectives. This fine-grained representation requires high feature
resolution and precise semantic information. To effectively alleviate the
semantic misalignment caused by indiscriminate contextual information
aggregation, Flow Alignment FPN (FAFPN) is proposed for multi-scale feature
alignment aggregation. It generates semantic flow among feature maps from
different resolutions to transform their pixel positions. Furthermore, we
present a Multi-head Part Mask Generator (MPMG) to extract fine-grained
representation based on the aligned feature maps. Multiple parallel branches of
MPMG allow it to focus on different parts of targets to generate local masks
without label supervision. The diverse details in target masks facilitate
fine-grained representation. Eventually, benefiting from a Shuffle-Group
Sampling (SGS) training strategy with positive and negative samples balanced,
we achieve state-of-the-art performance on MOT17 and MOT20 test sets. Even on
DanceTrack, where the appearance of targets is extremely similar, our method
significantly outperforms ByteTrack by 5.0% on HOTA and 5.6% on IDF1. Extensive
experiments have proved that diverse fine-grained representation makes Re-ID
great again in MOT.

different codes: Abacus, CUBEP$^3$M, Gadget, Enzo, PKDGrav3, and Ramses. By
applying symbolic regression to the different parts comprising the GNN, we
derive equations that can predict $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from halo catalogues of
simulations run with all of the above codes with accuracies similar to those of
the GNN. We show that by tuning a single free parameter, our equations can also
infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from galaxy catalogues of thousands of
state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project, each with a
different astrophysics model, run with five distinct codes that employ
different subgrid physics: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, Astrid, Magneticum,

catalogues from simulations covering a vast region in parameter space that
samples variations in 5 cosmological and 23 astrophysical parameters. We
speculate that the equations may reflect the existence of a fundamental physics
relation between the phase-space distribution of generic tracers and

characterization methods with quantum error mitigation techniques, which allow
us to transform and control the intrinsic noise in a quantum circuit.
Specifically, we selectively enhance or reduce decoherence rates in the quantum
circuit to achieve the desired simulation of open system dynamics. We describe
our methods in detail and report on the results of noise characterization and
quantum error mitigation on real and emulated IBM Quantum computers. We also
provide estimates of the experimental resource requirements for our techniques.
We believe that this approach can pave the way for new simulation techniques in

rephrase the percolation on the hypergraph network as a message passing

objective is one of the central goals of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL). Nevertheless in many real-world scenarios, separately trained and
specialized agents are deployed into a shared environment, or the environment
requires multiple objectives to be achieved by different coexisting parties.
These variations among specialties and objectives are likely to cause mixed
motives that eventually result in a social dilemma where all the parties are at
a loss. In order to resolve this issue, we propose the Incentive Q-Flow
(IQ-Flow) algorithm, which modifies the system's reward setup with an incentive
regulator agent such that the cooperative policy also corresponds to the
self-interested policy for the agents. Unlike the existing methods that learn
to incentivize self-interested agents, IQ-Flow does not make any assumptions
about agents' policies or learning algorithms, which enables the generalization
of the developed framework to a wider array of applications. IQ-Flow performs
an offline evaluation of the optimality of the learned policies using the data
provided by other agents to determine cooperative and self-interested policies.
Next, IQ-Flow uses meta-gradient learning to estimate how policy evaluation
changes according to given incentives and modifies the incentive such that the
greedy policy for cooperative objective and self-interested objective yield the
same actions. We present the operational characteristics of IQ-Flow in Iterated
Matrix Games. We demonstrate that IQ-Flow outperforms the state-of-the-art
incentive design algorithm in Escape Room and 2-Player Cleanup environments. We
further demonstrate that the pretrained IQ-Flow mechanism significantly
outperforms the performance of the shared reward setup in the 2-Player Cleanup

increase the probability of error and research into metrics that identify what
dissimilarities in data affect model performance is on-going. Recently,
combinatorial coverage metrics have been explored in the literature as an
alternative to distribution-based metrics. Results show that coverage metrics
can correlate with classification error. However, other results show that the
utility of coverage metrics is highly dataset-dependent. In this paper, we show
that this dataset-dependence can be alleviated with metric learning, a machine
learning technique for learning latent spaces where data from different classes
is further apart. In a study of 6 open-source datasets, we find that metric
learning increased the difference between set-difference coverage metrics

demonstrating that metric learning improves the ability of SDCCMs to anticipate

specification (called choreography) of a communicating system, and then a

Unfortunately, it is possible to write choreographies that cannot be compiled,
because of issues related to an agreement property known as knowledge of

that may be orthogonal to the protocol that they are writing.
  Amendment is an automatic procedure for repairing uncompilable

built upon an existing formalisation of choreographic programming. However, in
the process of formalising the expected properties of this procedure, we
discovered a subtle counterexample that invalidates the original published and

computational challenge. A popular class of compression techniques overcomes
this challenge by pruning or sparsifying the weights of pretrained networks.
While useful, these techniques often face serious tradeoffs between
computational requirements and compression quality. In this work, we propose a
novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect
of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint.
Our approach, CHITA, extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and
results in significant improvements in speed, memory, and performance over
existing optimization-based approaches for network pruning. CHITA's main
workhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a memory-friendly
representation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function. On a
standard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to
significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For
example, for MLPNet with only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves
the accuracy by 63% relative to the state of the art. Furthermore, when used in
conjunction with fine-tuning SGD steps, our method achieves significant
accuracy gains over the state-of-the-art approaches.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sequential recommenders have made great strides in capturing a user's
preferences. Nevertheless, the cold-start recommendation remains a fundamental
challenge in which only a few user-item interactions are available for
personalization. Gradient-based meta-learning approaches have recently emerged
in the sequential recommendation field due to their fast adaptation and
easy-to-integrate abilities. The meta-learning algorithms formulate the
cold-start recommendation as a few-shot learning problem, where each user is
represented as a task to be adapted. However, while meta-learning algorithms
generally assume that task-wise samples are evenly distributed over classes or
values, user-item interactions are not that way in real-world applications
(e.g., watching favorite videos multiple times, leaving only good ratings and
no bad ones). As a result, in the real-world, imbalanced user feedback that
accounts for most task training data may dominate the user adaptation and
prevent meta-learning algorithms from learning meaningful meta-knowledge for
personalized recommendations. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel
sequential recommendation framework based on gradient-based meta-learning that
captures the imbalance of each user's rating distribution and accordingly
computes adaptive loss for user-specific learning. It is the first work to
tackle the impact of imbalanced ratings in cold-start sequential recommendation
scenarios. We design adaptive weighted loss and improve the existing
meta-learning algorithms for state-of-the-art sequential recommendation
methods. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework.

development of models should allow time for maturing the process understanding,

are fulfilled: obtain a refined solution to the initial orbit determination
problem and detect possible outliers in the processed measurements. The
uncertainty on the initial estimate is propagated forward in time and
progressively reduced by exploiting sensor data available in said propagation
window. Differential algebra techniques and a novel automatic domain splitting
algorithm for second-order Taylor expansions are used to efficiently propagate
uncertainties over time. A multifidelity approach is employed to minimize the
computational effort while retaining the accuracy of the propagated estimate.
At each observation epoch, a polynomial map is obtained by projecting the
propagated states onto the observable space. Domains that do no overlap with
the actual measurement are pruned thus reducing the uncertainty to be further
propagated. Measurement outliers are also detected in this step. The refined
estimate and pruned observations are then used to improve the robustness of
batch orbit determination tools. The effectiveness of the algorithm is
demonstrated for a geostationary transfer orbit object using synthetic and real

in the redshift range $1\lesssim z\lesssim 3$, we investigate correlations
between the peak absolute magnitude in a synthetic UV filter centered at 250 nm
and rise time, colour and decline rate of SLSNe-I light curves. We observe a
linear correlation between $M_0(250)$ and the rise time with an intrinsic
scatter of 0.29. Interestingly, this correlation is further tightened
($\sigma_{int} \approx 0.2$) by eliminating those SLSNe which show a pre-peak
bump in their light curve. This result hints at the possibility that the
""bumpy"" SLSNe could belong to a different population. Weak correlations are
observed between the peak luminosity and colour indices. No relationship is
found between UV peak magnitude and the decline rate in contrast to what is
typically found in optical band. The correlations found here are promising, and
give encouraging insights for the use of SLSNe as cosmological probes at high

phases of 194 solar X-ray flares using archived data from the Bent Crystal
Spectrometer (BCS) on Solar Maximum Mission (operational 1980~--~1989). The
abundances are derived from the ratio of the total calcium X-ray line emission
in BCS channel~1 to that in neighboring continuum, with temperature from a
satellite-to-resonance line ratio. Generally the calcium abundance is found to
be about three times the photospheric abundance, as previously found,
indicating a ``FIP'' (first ionization potential) effect for calcium which has
a relatively low FIP value. The precision of the abundance estimates (referred
to hydrogen on a logarithmic scale with $A({\rm H}) = 12$), is typically $\sim
\pm 0.01$, enabling any time variations of $A({\rm Ca})$ during the flare decay
to be examined. For a total of 270 short time segments with $A({\rm Ca})$
determined to better than 2.3\% accuracy, many (106; 39\%) showed variations in
$A({\rm Ca})$ at the $3\sigma$ level. For the majority, 74 (70\%) of these 106

networks (DNNs) size, especially for generative adversarial networks (GANs).
Since GANs usually suffer from high computational complexity, researchers have
shown an increased interest in applying pruning methods to reduce the training
and inference costs of GANs. Among different pruning methods invented for
supervised learning, dynamic sparse training (DST) has gained increasing
attention recently as it enjoys excellent training efficiency with comparable
performance to post-hoc pruning. Hence, applying DST on GANs, where we train a
sparse GAN with a fixed parameter count throughout training, seems to be a good
candidate for reducing GAN training costs. However, a few challenges, including
the degrading training instability, emerge due to the adversarial nature of
GANs. Hence, we introduce a quantity called balance ratio (BR) to quantify the
balance of the generator and the discriminator. We conduct a series of
experiments to show the importance of BR in understanding sparse GAN training.
Building upon single dynamic sparse training (SDST), where only the generator
is adjusted during training, we propose double dynamic sparse training (DDST)
to control the BR during GAN training. Empirically, DDST automatically
determines the density of the discriminator and greatly boosts the performance
of sparse GANs on multiple datasets.

odometry (LIO) provides the basic capability of state estimation by tracking
LiDAR scans. The high-accuracy tracking generally involves the kNN search,
which is used with minimizing the point-to-plane distance. The cost for this,
however, is maintaining a large local map and performing kNN plane fit for each
point. In this work, we reduce both time and space complexity of LIO by saving
these unnecessary costs. Technically, we design a plane pre-fitting (PPF)
pipeline to track the basic skeleton of the 3D scene. In PPF, planes are not
fitted individually for each scan, let alone for each point, but are updated
incrementally as the scene 'flows'. Unlike kNN, the PPF is more robust to noisy
and non-strict planes with our iterative Principal Component Analyse (iPCA)
refinement. Moreover, a simple yet effective sandwich layer is introduced to
eliminate false point-to-plane matches. Our method was extensively tested on a
total number of 22 sequences across 5 open datasets, and evaluated in 3
existing state-of-the-art LIO systems. By contrast, LIO-PPF can consume only
36% of the original local map size to achieve up to 4x faster residual
computing and 1.92x overall FPS, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.

understand DNA's 3D folding in nuclei. The Hi-C method captures contact
frequencies between DNA segment pairs across the genome. When analyzing Hi-C
data sets, it is common to group these pairs using standard bioinformatics
methods (e.g., PCA). Other approaches handle Hi-C data as weighted networks,
where connected node represent DNA segments in 3D proximity. In this
representation, one can leverage community detection techniques developed in
complex network theory to group nodes into mesoscale communities containing
similar connection patterns. While there are several successful attempts to
analyze Hi-C data in this way, it is common to report and study the most
typical community structure. But in reality, there are often several valid
candidates. Therefore, depending on algorithm design, different community
detection methods focusing on slightly different connectivity features may have
differing views on the ideal node groupings. In fact, even the same community
detection method may yield different results if using a stochastic algorithm.
This ambiguity is fundamental to community detection and shared by most complex
networks whenever interactions span all scales in the network. This is known as
community inconsistency. This paper explores this inconsistency of 3D
communities in Hi-C data for all human chromosomes. We base our analysis on two
inconsistency metrics, one local and one global, and quantify the network
scales where the community separation is most variable. For example, we find
that TADs are less reliable than A/B compartments and that nodes with highly
variable node-community memberships are associated with open chromatin.
Overall, our study provides a helpful framework for data-driven researchers and
increases awareness of some inherent challenges when clustering Hi-C data into
3D communities.

real world. Common training strategies to improve generalization involve the
use of data augmentations, ensembling and model averaging. In this work, we
first establish a surprisingly simple but strong benchmark for generalization
which utilizes diverse augmentations within a training minibatch, and show that
this can learn a more balanced distribution of features. Further, we propose
Diversify-Aggregate-Repeat Training (DART) strategy that first trains diverse
models using different augmentations (or domains) to explore the loss basin,
and further Aggregates their weights to combine their expertise and obtain
improved generalization. We find that Repeating the step of Aggregation
throughout training improves the overall optimization trajectory and also
ensures that the individual models have a sufficiently low loss barrier to
obtain improved generalization on combining them. We shed light on our approach
by casting it in the framework proposed by Shen et al. and theoretically show
that it indeed generalizes better. In addition to improvements in In- Domain
generalization, we demonstrate SOTA performance on the Domain Generalization
benchmarks in the popular DomainBed framework as well. Our method is generic
and can easily be integrated with several base training algorithms to achieve
performance gains.

under budget constraints, has received a lot of attention in recent years. It
has numerous applications, including dynamic pricing, repeated auctions, etc.
Previous work has focused on one of the two extremes: Stochastic BwK where the
rewards and consumptions of the resources each round are sampled from an i.i.d.
distribution, and Adversarial BwK where these values are picked by an
adversary. Achievable guarantees in the two cases exhibit a massive gap:
No-regret learning is achievable in Stochastic BwK, but in Adversarial BwK,
only competitive ratio style guarantees are achievable, where the competitive
ratio depends on the budget. What makes this gap so vast is that in Adversarial
BwK the guarantees get worse in the typical case when the budget is more
binding. While ``best-of-both-worlds'' type algorithms are known (algorithms
that provide the best achievable guarantee in both extreme cases), their
guarantees degrade to the adversarial case as soon as the environment is not
fully stochastic.
  Our work aims to bridge this gap, offering guarantees for a workload that is
not exactly stochastic but is also not worst-case. We define a condition,
Approximately Stationary BwK, that parameterizes how close to stochastic or
adversarial an instance is. Based on these parameters, we explore what is the
best competitive ratio attainable in BwK. We explore two algorithms that are
oblivious to the values of the parameters but guarantee competitive ratios that
smoothly transition between the best possible guarantees in the two extreme
cases, depending on the values of the parameters. Our guarantees offer great
improvement over the adversarial guarantee, especially when the available
budget is small. We also prove bounds on the achievable guarantee, showing that
our results are approximately tight when the budget is small.

specify a prompt once at the beginning of training. During training, the LLM
evaluates an RL agent's behavior against the desired behavior described by the
prompt and outputs a corresponding reward signal. The RL agent then uses this
reward to update its behavior. We evaluate whether our approach can train
agents aligned with user objectives in the Ultimatum Game, matrix games, and

GNNs utilize local node features and the graph structure in the prediction.
However, more efficient forecasting can still be achieved by following two main
routes; enlarging the scale of the transportation graph, and simultaneously
exploiting different types of nodes and edges in the graphs. However, both
approaches are challenged by the scalability of GNNs. An immediate remedy to
the scalability challenge is to decentralize the GNN operation. However, this
creates excessive node-to-node communication. In this paper, we first
characterize the excessive communication needs for the decentralized GNN

inter-cloudlet communication thereby alleviating the communication overhead of
the decentralized approach while promoting scalability due to cloudlet-level

improved taxi-level demand and supply forecasting for handling dynamic taxi

(PDE) is a highly developed field of optimization theory. The elegant adjoint
formalism allows to compute shape gradients at the computational cost of a
further PDE solve. Thus, gradient descent methods can be applied to shape
optimization problems. However, gradient descent methods that can be understood
as approximation to gradient flows get stuck in local minima, if the
optimization problem is non-convex. In machine learning, the optimization in
high dimensional non-convex energy landscapes has been successfully tackled by
momentum methods, which can be understood as passing from gradient flow to
dissipative Hamiltonian flows. In this paper, we adopt this strategy for
non-convex shape optimization. In particular, we provide a mechanical shape
optimization problem that is motivated by optimal reliability considering also
material cost and the necessity to avoid certain obstructions in installation
space. We then show how this problem can be solved effectively by port
Hamiltonian shape flows.

pronounced random component. Such stochastic oscillations can emerge via
different mechanisms, for example linear dynamics of a stable focus with
fluctuations, limit-cycle systems perturbed by noise, or excitable systems in
which random inputs lead to a train of pulses. Despite their diverse origins,
the phenomenology of random oscillations can be strikingly similar. Here we
introduce a nonlinear transformation of stochastic oscillators to a new
complex-valued function $Q^*_1(\textbf{x})$ that greatly simplifies and unifies
the mathematical description of the oscillator's spontaneous activity, its
response to an external time-dependent perturbation, and the correlation
statistics of different oscillators that are weakly coupled. The function
$Q^*_1(\textbf{x})$ is the eigenfunction of the Kolmogorov backward operator
with the least negative (but non-vanishing) eigenvalue
$\lambda_1=\mu_1+i\omega_1$. The resulting power spectrum of the complex-valued
function is exactly given by a Lorentz spectrum with peak frequency $\omega_1$
and half-width $\mu_1$; its susceptibility with respect to a weak external
forcing is given by a simple one-pole filter, centered around $\omega_1$; and
the cross-spectrum between two coupled oscillators can be easily expressed by a
combination of the spontaneous power spectra of the uncoupled systems and their
susceptibilities. Our approach makes qualitatively different stochastic
oscillators comparable, provides simple characteristics for the coherence of
the random oscillation, and gives a framework for the description of weakly
coupled oscillators.

present study aims to investigate this issue by probing the neuropsychological
mechanisms of face recognition, while also exploring a possible learning effect
observed in regularly seen (personally familiar) masked faces. Our stimuli
consisted of personally familiar, famous, and unfamiliar Indian faces in masked
and unmasked conditions. Subjects participated in a 2-back task wherein trials
were balanced within and across blocks to represent all conditions identically,
while behavioral and EEG responses were recorded. Statistical analyses revealed
significant main effects of familiarity and mask-conditions on performance
accuracy and reaction time (RT). The highest performance accuracy was observed
for familiar and unmasked faces and the least for unfamiliar and masked ones,
whereas RTs followed expected reverse trends. Notably, the difference in
performance accuracy between unmasked and masked famous faces was more
prominent than that for personally familiar faces. These observations are
suggestive of a beneficial effect of visual experience found for frequently
seen masked faces. Masked unfamiliar faces contributed to the highest
proportion of false-positive errors, indicating the inherent difficulty in
processing novel masked faces compared to known ones. EEG analysis revealed
effect of face masks on N250 for both famous and personally familiar faces and
N170 for only personally familiar faces. Our study suggests that personal
familiarity aids perceptual learning of masked faces, and this learning may not
generalize across familiarity levels.

similar tasks that gradually grow in difficulty and progress toward the main
task. The proposed method requires no pre-training phase. Specifically, the
learning of simpler tasks is only done for one iteration. The generated
knowledge could be used by any transfer learning, including value transfer and
policy transfer, to reduce the sample complexity while not adding to the
computational complexity. So, it can be applied to any goal, environment, and

methods and both tabular methods and deep-RL methods. We have evaluated our
proposed framework on both a simple Random Walk for illustration purposes and
on more challenging optimal control problems with constraint. The experiments

While certain goals can be achieved by picking and placing the objects of
interest directly, object reorientation is needed for precise placement in most
of the tasks. In such scenarios, the object must be reoriented and
re-positioned into intermediate poses that facilitate accurate placement at the
target pose. To this end, we propose a reorientation planning method,
ReorientDiff, that utilizes a diffusion model-based approach. The proposed
method employs both visual inputs from the scene, and goal-specific language
prompts to plan intermediate reorientation poses. Specifically, the scene and
language-task information are mapped into a joint scene-task representation
feature space, which is subsequently leveraged to condition the diffusion
model. The diffusion model samples intermediate poses based on the
representation using classifier-free guidance and then uses gradients of
learned feasibility-score models for implicit iterative pose-refinement. The
proposed method is evaluated using a set of YCB-objects and a suction gripper,
demonstrating a success rate of 96.5\% in simulation. Overall, our study
presents a promising approach to address the reorientation challenge in

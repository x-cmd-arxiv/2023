spatially acquire an optical link with a jittering search beam. The analytical
model accounts for an arbitrary jitter spectrum and considers the associated
correlations between jitter excursions on adjacent tracks of the search spiral.
An expression of P-fail in terms of basic transcendental functions is found by
linearizing the exact analytical model with respect to the correlation
strength. Predictions from the models indicate a strong decrease of P-fail with
increasing correlation-strength, which is found to be in excellent agreement to
results from Monte Carlo simulations. The dependency of P-fail on track-width
and scan speed is investigated, confirming previous assumptions on the impact
of correlations. Expressions and applicable constraints are derived for the
limits of full and no correlations, and the optimal track width to minimize the
acquisition time is computed for a range of scan speeds. The model is
applicable to optical terminals equipped with a fast beam steering mirror, as
often found for optical communication missions in space.

investigating the spectroscopic capabilities of the Euclid Near-Infrared
Spectrometer and Photometer (NISP), in terms of continuum and emission line
detection in the context of galaxy evolutionary studies. To this purpose we
constructed, emulated, and analysed the spectra of 4992 star-forming galaxies
at $0.3 \leq z \leq 2.5$ using the NISP pixel-level simulator. We built the
spectral library starting from public multi-wavelength galaxy catalogues, with
value-added information on spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting results,
and from Bruzual and Charlot (2003) stellar population templates. Rest-frame
optical and near-IR nebular emission lines were included using empirical and
theoretical relations. We inferred the 3.5$\sigma$ NISP red grism spectroscopic
detection limit of the continuum measured in the $H$ band for star-forming
galaxies with a median disk half-light radius of \ang{;;0.4} at magnitude $H=
19.5\pm0.2\,$AB$\,$mag for the Euclid Wide Survey and at $H =
20.8\pm0.6\,$AB$\,$mag for the Euclid Deep Survey. We found a very good
agreement with the red grism emission line detection limit requirement for the
Wide and Deep surveys. We characterised the effect of the galaxy shape on the
detection capability of the red grism and highlighted the degradation of the
quality of the extracted spectra as the disk size increases. In particular, we
found that the extracted emission line signal to noise ratio (SNR) drops by
$\sim\,$45$\%$ when the disk size ranges from \ang{;;0.25} to \ang{;;1}. These
trends lead to a correlation between the emission line SNR and the stellar mass
of the galaxy and we demonstrate the effect in a stacking analysis unveiling
emission lines otherwise too faint to detect.

flow modeling is presented and discussed. By analyzing the asymptotic limits of
the proposed model, it is shown that different types of blood propagation
phenomena in arteries and veins can be described through an appropriate choice
of scaling parameters, which are related to distinct characterizations of the
fluid-structure interaction mechanism (whether elastic or viscoelastic) that
exist between vessel walls and blood flow. In these asymptotic limits,
well-known blood flow models from the literature are recovered. Additionally,
by analyzing the perturbation of the local elastic equilibrium of the system, a
new viscoelastic blood flow model is derived. The proposed approach is highly
flexible and suitable for studying the human cardiovascular system, which is
composed of vessels with high morphological and mechanical variability. The
resulting multiscale hyperbolic model of blood flow is solved using an
asymptotic-preserving Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta Finite Volume method, which
ensures the consistency of the numerical scheme with the different asymptotic
limits of the mathematical model without affecting the choice of the time step
by restrictions related to the smallness of the scaling parameters. Several
numerical tests confirm the validity of the proposed methodology, including a
case study investigating the hemodynamics of a thoracic aorta in the presence
of a stent.

due to its excellent generalization performance. Several studies demonstrated
this success is attributed to the implicit bias of the method that prefers a
flat minimum and developed new methods based on this perspective. Recently,
Izmailov et al. (2018) empirically observed that an averaged stochastic
gradient descent with a large step size can bring out the implicit bias more
effectively and can converge more stably to a flat minimum than the vanilla
stochastic gradient descent. In our work, we theoretically justify this
observation by showing that the averaging scheme improves the bias-optimization
tradeoff coming from the stochastic gradient noise: a large step size amplifies
the bias but makes convergence unstable, and vice versa. Specifically, we show
that the averaged stochastic gradient descent can get closer to a solution of a
penalized objective on the sharpness than the vanilla stochastic gradient
descent using the same step size under certain conditions. In experiments, we
verify our theory and show this learning scheme significantly improves
performance.

be applied to signals of a different nature, such as audio and image signals.
In the image case, a progressive pixel corruption process is carried out by
applying random noise, and a neural network is trained to revert each one of
the corruption steps. For the reconstruction process to be reversible, it is
necessary to carry out the corruption very progressively. If the training of
the neural network is successful, it will be possible to generate an image from
random noise by chaining a number of steps similar to those used for image

a short cooling time ($\lesssim1~\mathrm{Gyr}$). Theoretical models predict
that this gas is susceptible to multiphase condensation, in which cold gas is
expected to condense out of the hot phase if the ratio of the thermal
instability growth time scale ($t_{\mathrm{ti}}$) to the free-fall time
($t_{\mathrm{ff}}$) is $t_{\mathrm{ti}}/t_{\mathrm{ff}}\lesssim10$. The
turbulent mixing time $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is another important time scale: if
$t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is short enough, the fluctuations are mixed before they can
cool. In this study, we perform high-resolution
($512^2\times768$--$1024^2\times1536$ resolution elements) hydrodynamic
simulations of turbulence in a stratified medium, including radiative cooling
of the gas. We explore the parameter space of $t_{\mathrm{ti}}/t_{\mathrm{ff}}$
and $t_{\mathrm{ti}}/t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ relevant to galaxy and cluster halos. We
also study the effect of the steepness of the entropy profile, the strength of
turbulent forcing and the nature of turbulent forcing (natural mixture vs.
compressive modes) on multiphase gas condensation. We find that larger values
of $t_{\mathrm{ti}}/t_{\mathrm{ff}}$ or $t_{\mathrm{ti}}/t_{\mathrm{mix}}$
generally imply stability against multiphase gas condensation, whereas larger
density fluctuations (e.g., due to compressible turbulence) promote multiphase
gas condensation. We propose a new criterion
$\min(t_{\mathrm{ti}}/\min(t_{\mathrm{mix}},t_\mathrm{ff}))\lesssim

the time series of 633 overtone pulsating field RR Lyrae (RRc) stars. The
majority of stars (82.8 per cent) contain additional frequencies beyond the
main pulsation. In addition to the frequencies previously explained by the
$\ell = 8$ and $\ell = 9$ non-radial modes, we have identified a group of stars
where the additional frequencies may belong to the $\ell = 10$ non-radial
modes. We found that stars with no additional frequencies are more common among
stars with shorter periods, while stars with longer periods almost always show
additional frequencies. The incidence rate and this period distribution both
agree well with the predictions of recent theoretical models. The amplitude and
phase of additional frequencies are varying in time. The frequencies of
different non-radial modes appearing in a given star seem to vary on different
timescales. We have determined a 10.4 per cent incidence rate for the Blazhko
effect. For several stars we have detected continuous annual-scale phase change
without significant amplitude variation. This type of variation offers a
plausible explanation for the `phase jump' phenomenon reported in many RRc
stars. The main pulsation frequency could show quasi-periodic phase and
amplitude fluctuations. This fluctuation is clearly related to additional
frequencies present in the star: stars with two non-radial modes show the
strongest fluctuations, while stars with no such modes show no fluctuations at
all. The summation of the phase fluctuation over time may explain the O-C
variations that have long been known for many non-Blazhko RRc stars.

microfilamentary chitin particles. The layers are stacked one on top of the
other realizing a helical (Bouligand helix) pattern. This structure generates
optical phenomena such as structural colors and birefringence that produce a
metalic or iridescent appearance, polarization upon reflection and optical
activity. We model the anisotropic optical responses of the cuticle of
arthropods using the Photonic package to obtain the macroscopic dielectric
tensor of a constitutive layer in the Bouligand helix. We find that its
anisotropy depends on the shape of the chitin particles, their reticular
arrangement and their filling fractions. As a main result, we obtained a
cuticle model with tunable reflectance band gaps that are very sensitive to
geometrical parameters such as the angle $\theta$ that controls the helix
pitch. We can explain the structural colors in terms of the reflectance band
gap induced by the modulation of the anisotropy mediated by $\theta$, instead
of following the usual approach that consider multiple arrangement of layers
pairs with different thickness and optical properties.

  the Sun and stars","43 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Space Science Reviews",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The most widely accepted model of the solar cycle is the flux transport
dynamo model. This model evolved out of the traditional $\alpha \Omega$ dynamo
model which was first developed at a time when the existence of the Sun's
meridional circulation was not known. In these models, the toroidal magnetic
field (which gives rise to sunspots) is generated by the stretching of the
poloidal field by solar differential rotation. The primary source of the
poloidal field in the flux transport models is attributed to the
Babcock--Leighton mechanism, in contrast to the mean-field $\alpha$-effect used
in earlier models. With the realization that the Sun has a meridional
circulation, which is poleward at the surface and is expected to be equatorward
at the bottom of the convection zone, its importance for transporting the
magnetic fields in the dynamo process was recognized. Much of our understanding
about the physics of both the meridional circulation and the flux transport
dynamo has come from the mean field theory obtained by averaging the equations
of MHD over turbulent fluctuations. The mean field theory of meridional
circulation makes clear how it arises out of an interplay between the
centrifugal and thermal wind terms. We provide a broad review of mean field
theories for solar magnetic fields and flows, the flux transport dynamo
modeling paradigm and highlight some of their applications to solar and stellar
magnetic cycles. We also discuss how the dynamo-generated magnetic field acts
on the meridional circulation of the Sun and how the fluctuations in the
meridional circulation, in turn, affect the solar dynamo. We conclude with some
remarks on how the synergy of mean field theories, flux transport dynamo
models, and direct numerical simulations can inspire the future of this field.

various retinal diseases including age-related macular degeneration, diabetic
retinopathy and glaucoma. FP allows the clinician to examine the ocular fundus
structures such as the macula, the optic disc (OD) and retinal vessels, whose
visibility and clarity in an FP image remain central to ensuring diagnostic
accuracy, and hence determine the diagnostic quality (DQ). Images with low DQ,
resulting from eye movement, improper illumination and other possible causes,
should obviously be recaptured. However, the technician, often unfamiliar with
DQ criteria, initiates recapture only based on expert feedback. The process
potentially engages the imaging device multiple times for single subject, and
wastes the time and effort of the ophthalmologist, the technician and the
subject. The burden could be prohibitive in case of teleophthalmology, where
obtaining feedback from the remote expert entails additional communication cost
and delay. Accordingly, a strong need for automated diagnostic quality
assessment (DQA) has been felt, where an image is immediately assigned a DQ
category. In response, motivated by the notional continuum of DQ, we propose a
hierarchical deep learning (DL) architecture to distinguish between good,
usable and unusable categories. On the public EyeQ dataset, we achieve an
accuracy of 89.44%, improving upon existing methods. In addition, using
gradient based class activation map (Grad-CAM), we generate a visual
explanation which agrees with the expert intuition. Future FP cameras equipped

power by employing a deep neural network-based Meta-Learner on top of INFUSE.
First, a hybrid feature space is created by integrating decision and feature
spaces. Five different classifiers are utilized to generate a pool of decision
spaces. The feature space is then enriched through a deep sparse autoencoder
that learns the semantic relationships between attacks. Finally, the deep
Meta-Learner acts as an ensemble combiner to analyze the hybrid feature space

By utilizing cyanobacteria, the first organisms to evolve oxygenic
photosynthesis on our planet, and a starlight simulator capable of accurately
reproducing the emission spectrum of an M-dwarf in the range 350-900 nm, we
could answer this question. Methods: We performed experiments with the

to exploit long-range interactions in face images for iterative propagation of
information from latent variables to salient facial features. Special loss
functions are designed to support the optimization of face morphing. Second, we
extend the study of transformer-based face morphing to demorphing by presenting
an effective defense strategy with access to a reference image using the same
generator of MorphGANFormer. Such demorphing is conceptually similar to
unmixing of hyperspectral images but operates in the latent (instead of pixel)
space. Third, for the first time, we address a fundamental issue of
vulnerability-detectability trade-off for face morphing studies. It is argued
that neither doppelganger norrandom pair selection is optimal, and a Lagrangian
multiplier-based approach should be used to achieve an improved trade-off
between recognition vulnerability and attack detectability.

Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation have been considered to improve its spectral
containment and its performance level in the presence of heavy Doppler shifts.
This paper examines a novel modulation, named Doppler-Resilient Universal
Filtered MultiCarrier (DR-UFMC), which has the objective of combining the
advantages provided by the Universal Filtered MultiCarrier (UFMC) modulation
(i.e., better spectral containment), with those of the Orthogonal Time
Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation (i.e., better performance in time-varying
environments). The paper contains the mathematical model and detailed
transceiver block scheme of the newly described modulation, along with a
numerical analysis contrasting DR-UFMC against OTFS, OFDM with one-tap
frequency domain equalization (FDE), and OFDM with multicarrier multisymbol
linear MMSE processing. Results clearly show the superiority, with respect to
the cited benchmarks, of the newly proposed modulation in terms of achievable
spectral efficiency. Interestingly, it is also seen that OFDM, when considered
in conjunction with multicarrier multisymbol linear minimum mean squares error
(MMSE) processing, performs slightly better than OTFS in terms of achievable
spectral efficiency.

importance of studying the links between cognitive and linguistic aspects of

is hardly explored for modeling narratives. In this work, we propose the task
of automatically detecting prominent elements of the narrative structure by
analyzing the role of characters' inferred mental state along with linguistic
information at the syntactic and semantic levels. We introduce a STORIES
dataset of short personal narratives containing manual annotations of key
elements of narrative structure, specifically climax and resolution. To this
end, we implement a computational model that leverages the protagonist's mental

incomplete information on the private provision of one public good to
investigate the effect of ex-ante asymmetry. In the unique equilibrium,
asymmetry leads to a stratified behavior pattern such that one player provides
the good instantly with a positive probability, while each of the others has no
probability of provision before a certain moment which is idiosyncratic.
Comparative statics show that one with less patience, lower cost of provision,
and higher reputation in valuation provides uniformly faster. The cost of delay
is mainly determined by the strongest type, namely the highest type of the
instant-exit player. This paper considers two types of introduction of
asymmetry: raising the strongest type tends to improve efficiency, whereas
controlling the strongest type aligns the effect of asymmetry with the sign of

that advance the understanding of the phenomenon. Simulations with pure water
and water with dissolved NaCl are considered. First, the effect of surface
charge on the sign and magnitude of the thermo-osmotic coefficient is
quantified. This effect was found to be mainly linked to the structural
modifications of aqueous electrical double layer (EDL) caused by the
nanoconfinement and surface charges. In addition, the results illustrate that
the surface charges reduce the self-diffusivity and thermo-osmosis of
interfacial liquid. The thermo-osmosis was found to change direction when the
surface charge density exceeds -0.03C/m*m. It was found that the thermo-osmotic
flow and self-diffusivity increases with the concentration of NaCl. The fluxes
of solvent and solute are decoupled by considering the Ludwig-Soret effect of
NaCl ions to identify the main mechanisms controlling the behavior. In addition

interpolate the training data, deep networks are known to generalize well to

training algorithms used have certain implicit regularization properties that
ensure interpolating solutions with ""good"" properties are found. This is best
understood in linear over-parametrized models where it has been shown that the
celebrated stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm finds an interpolating
solution that is closest in Euclidean distance to the initial weight vector.
Different regularizers, replacing Euclidean distance with Bregman divergence,
can be obtained if we replace SGD with stochastic mirror descent (SMD).
Empirical observations have shown that in the deep network setting, SMD
achieves a generalization performance that is different from that of SGD (and

to understand this behavior, we obtain the generalization error of SMD for
over-parametrized linear models for a binary classification problem where the

results that validate the theory and, in particular, introduce two data models,
one for which SMD with an $\ell_2$ regularizer (i.e., SGD) outperforms SMD with

for sale, properties for rent, rides for hire, and various other goods and
services. Machine learning-based prices are typically generated by complex
algorithms trained on historical sales data. However, displaying these prices
to consumers anchors the realized sales prices, which will in turn become
training samples for future iterations of the algorithms. The economic
implications of this machine learning ""feedback loop"" - an indirect
human-algorithm interaction - remain relatively unexplored. In this work, we
develop an analytical model of machine learning feedback loops in the context
of the housing market. We show that feedback loops lead machine learning
algorithms to become overconfident in their own accuracy (by underestimating
its error), and leads home sellers to over-rely on possibly erroneous
algorithmic prices. As a consequence at the feedback loop equilibrium, sale
prices can become entirely erratic (relative to true consumer preferences in
absence of ML price interference). We then identify conditions (choice of ML
models, seller characteristics and market characteristics) where the economic
payoffs for home sellers at the feedback loop equilibrium is worse off than no
machine learning. We also empirically validate primitive building blocks of our
analytical model using housing market data from Zillow. We conclude by
prescribing algorithmic corrective strategies to mitigate the effects of
machine learning feedback loops, discuss the incentives for platforms to adopt
these strategies, and discuss the role of policymakers in regulating the same.

many real-world applications like policy analysis and decision making.
Nevertheless, estimating treatment effects in the longitudinal setting in the
presence of hidden confounders remains an extremely challenging problem.
Recently, there is a growing body of work attempting to obtain unbiased ITE
estimates from time-dynamic observational data by ignoring the possible
existence of hidden confounders. Additionally, many existing works handling
hidden confounders are not applicable for continuous-time settings. In this
paper, we extend the line of work focusing on deconfounding in the dynamic time
setting in the presence of hidden confounders. We leverage recent advancements
in neural differential equations to build a latent factor model using a
stochastic controlled differential equation and Lipschitz constrained
convolutional operation in order to continuously incorporate information about
ongoing interventions and irregularly sampled observations. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the promise of continuous time
methods for estimating treatment effects in the presence of hidden confounders.

equations which solve a nonlinear transport system on $\mathbb{S}$. We show
that this system is locally well-posed in $L^p, p\geq 1$ as well as for atomic
measures, that is logarithmic spiral vortex sheets. In particular, we realize
the dynamics of logarithmic vortex sheets as the well-defined limit of
logarithmic solutions which could be smooth in the angle. Furthermore, our
formulation not only allows for a simple proof of existence and bifurcation for
non-symmetric multi branched logarithmic spiral vortex sheets but also provides
a framework for studying asymptotic stability of self-similar dynamics.
  We give a complete characterization of the long time behavior of logarithmic
spirals. We prove global well-posedness for bounded logarithmic spirals as well
as data that admit at most logarithmic singularities. This is due to the
observation that the local circulation of the vorticity around the origin is a
strictly monotone quantity of time. We are then able to show a dichotomy in the
long time behavior, solutions either blow up (either in finite or infinite
time) or completely homogenize. In particular, bounded logarithmic spirals
should converge to constant steady states. For logarithmic spiral sheets, the
dichotomy is shown to be even more drastic where only finite time blow up or
complete homogenization of the fluid can and does occur.

unknown in advance. We consider the problem of estimating the optimal policy
value in the sublinear data regime before the optimal policy is even learnable.
We refer to this as $V^*$ estimation. It was recently shown that fast $V^*$
estimation is possible but only in disjoint linear bandits with Gaussian
covariates. Whether this is possible for more realistic context distributions
has remained an open and important question for tasks such as model selection.
In this paper, we first provide lower bounds showing that this general problem
is hard. However, under stronger assumptions, we give an algorithm and analysis
proving that $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d})$ sublinear estimation of $V^*$
is indeed information-theoretically possible, where $d$ is the dimension. We
then present a more practical, computationally efficient algorithm that
estimates a problem-dependent upper bound on $V^*$ that holds for general
distributions and is tight when the context distribution is Gaussian. We prove
our algorithm requires only $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d})$ samples to
estimate the upper bound. We use this upper bound and the estimator to obtain
novel and improved guarantees for several applications in bandit model
selection and testing for treatment effects.

interstellar medium to the cold dense star-forming cores and eventually to
protostars is a long-standing problem. Despite sulfur's astrochemical
relevance, the abundance of S-bearing molecules in dense cores and regions
around protostars is still insufficiently constrained. The goal of this
investigation is to derive the gas-phase H$_2$S/OCS ratio for several low-mass
protostars, which could provide crucial information about the physical and
chemical conditions in the birth cloud of Sun-like stars. Using ALMA ACA Band 6
observations, H$_2$S, OCS, and their isotopologs are searched for in 10 Class
0/I protostars with different source properties such as age, mass, and
environmental conditions. An LTE model is used to fit synthetic spectra to the
detected lines and to derive the column densities based solely on optically
thin lines. The H$_2$S and OCS column densities span four orders of magnitude
across the sample. The H$_2$S/OCS ratio is found to be in the range from 0.2 to
above 9.7. IRAS 16293-2422 A and Ser-SMM3 have the lowest ratio, while
BHR71-IRS1 has the highest. Only the H$_2$S/OCS ratio of BHR71-IRS1 agress
within uncertainties with the ratio in comet 67P/C$-$G. The determined
gas-phase H$_2$S/OCS ratios can be below the upper limits on the solid-state
ratios by as much as an order of magnitude. The H$_2$S/OCS ratio depends
significantly on the environment of the birth cloud, such as UV-irradiation and
heating received prior to the formation of a protostar. The highly isolated
birth environment of BHR71-IRS1 is hypothesized to be the reason for its high
gaseous H$_2$S/OCS ratio due to lower rates of photoreactions and more
efficient hydrogenation reactions under such dark, cold conditions. The gaseous
inventory of S-bearing molecules in BHR71-IRS1 appears to be most similar to
that of interstellar ices.

based on the Eikonal equation. For the Eikonal equation with a point source,
the viscosity solution represents the least travel time of wave fields from the
source to the point at the high-frequency limit. The corresponding inverse
problem is to determine the inhomogeneous wave-speed distribution from the
first-arrival time data at the measurement surfaces corresponding to
distributed point sources, which is called transmission travel-time tomography.
At the low-frequency regime, the reconstruction approximates the
frequency-depend wave-speed distribution. We analyze the Eikonal inverse
problem and show that it is highly ill-posed. Then we developed a direct
probing method that incorporates the solution analysis of the Eikonal equation
and several aspects of the velocity models. When the wave-speed distribution
has a small variation from the homogeneous medium, we reconstruct the
inhomogeneous media using the filtered back projection method. For the
high-contrast media, we assume a background medium and develop the

that determines genesis, (2) an intensity-dependent beta-advection model that
determines the track, and (3) a non-linear differential equation set that
determines the intensification rate. The model is entirely forced by the
large-scale environment. Downscaling ERA5 reanalysis data shows that the model
is generally able to reproduce observed tropical cyclone climatology, such as
the global seasonal cycle, genesis locations, track density, and lifetime
maximum intensity distributions. Inter-annual variability in tropical cyclone
count and power-dissipation is also well captured, on both basin-wide and
global scales. Regional tropical cyclone hazard estimated by this model is also
analyzed using return period maps and curves. In particular, the model is able
to reasonably capture the observed return period curves of landfall intensity
in various sub-basins around the globe. The incorporation of an
intensity-dependent steering flow is shown to lead to regionally dependent
changes in power dissipation and return periods. Advantages and disadvantages
of this model, compared to other downscaling models, are also discussed.

reasoning is known as a formal methodology to reach answers from given
knowledge and facts. Inspired by such a view, we develop a novel neural
architecture named FOLNet (First-Order Logic Network), to encode this new
inductive bias. We construct a set of neural logic operators as learnable Horn
clauses, which are further forward-chained into a fully differentiable neural
architecture (FOLNet). Interestingly, we find that the self-attention module in
transformers can be composed by two of our neural logic operators, which
probably explains their strong reasoning performance. Our proposed FOLNet has
the same input and output interfaces as other pretrained models and thus could
be pretrained/finetuned by using similar losses. It also allows FOLNet to be
used in a plug-and-play manner when replacing other pretrained models. With our
logical inductive bias, the same set of ``logic deduction skills'' learned
through pretraining are expected to be equally capable of solving diverse
downstream tasks. For this reason, FOLNet learns language representations that
have much stronger transfer capabilities. Experimental results on several
language understanding tasks show that our pretrained FOLNet model outperforms
the existing strong transformer-based approaches.

often fail to generate multi-view 3D consistent images. The encoders designed
for 2D GANs are not able to provide sufficient 3D information for the inversion
and editing. Therefore, 3D-aware GAN inversion is proposed to increase the 3D
editing capability of GANs. However, the 3D-aware GAN inversion remains
under-explored. To tackle this problem, we propose a 3D-aware (3Da) encoder for
GAN inversion and face editing based on the powerful StyleNeRF model. Our
proposed 3Da encoder combines a parametric 3D face model with a learnable
detail representation model to generate geometry, texture and view direction
codes. For more flexible face manipulation, we then design a dual-branch
StyleFlow module to transfer the StyleNeRF codes with disentangled geometry and
texture flows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that we realize 3D consistent
face manipulation in both facial attribute editing and texture transfer.
Furthermore, for video editing, we make the sequence of frame codes share a
common canonical manifold, which improves the temporal consistency of the
edited attributes.

existing ISAC beamforming design by considering the FD capability for both
radar and communication. Specifically, we consider an ISAC system, where the
base station (BS) performs target detection and communicates with multiple
downlink users and uplink users reusing the same time and frequency resources.
We jointly optimize the downlink dual-functional transmit signal and the uplink
receive beamformers at the BS and the transmit power at the uplink users. The
problem is formulated to minimize the total transmit power of the system while
guaranteeing the communication and sensing requirements. The downlink and
uplink transmissions are tightly coupled, making the joint optimization
challenging. To handle this issue, we first determine the receive beamformers
in closed forms with respect to the BS transmit beamforming and the user
transmit power and then suggest an iterative solution to the remaining problem.
We demonstrate via numerical results that the optimized FD communication-based
ISAC leads to power efficiency improvement compared to conventional ISAC with

vision tasks, remarkable improvements have been widely reported with the use of
pretraining on publicly available data. This is in part due to the benefits of
transfer learning, which is the standard motivation for pretraining in
non-private settings. However, the stark contrast in the improvement achieved
through pretraining under privacy compared to non-private settings suggests
that there may be a deeper, distinct cause driving these gains. To explain this
phenomenon, we hypothesize that the non-convex loss landscape of a model
training necessitates an optimization algorithm to go through two phases. In
the first, the algorithm needs to select a good ""basin"" in the loss landscape.
In the second, the algorithm solves an easy optimization within that basin. The
former is a harder problem to solve with private data, while the latter is
harder to solve with public data due to a distribution shift or data scarcity.
Guided by this intuition, we provide theoretical constructions that provably
demonstrate the separation between private training with and without public
pretraining. Further, systematic experiments on CIFAR10 and LibriSpeech provide
supporting evidence for our hypothesis.

prevention has principal gaps, including black box methodologies, inadequate

media images (despite their popularity today, in our digital era). This study
addresses these gaps and combines theory-driven and bottom-up strategies to
construct a hybrid and interpretable prediction model of valid suicide risk
from images. The lead hypothesis was that images contain valuable information
about emotions and interpersonal relationships, two central concepts in
suicide-related treatments and theories. The dataset included 177,220 images by
841 Facebook users who completed a gold-standard suicide scale. The images were
represented with CLIP, a state-of-the-art algorithm, which was utilized,
unconventionally, to extract predefined features that served as inputs to a
simple logistic-regression prediction model (in contrast to complex neural
networks). The features addressed basic and theory-driven visual elements using
everyday language (e.g., bright photo, photo of sad people). The results of the
hybrid model (that integrated theory-driven and bottom-up methods) indicated
high prediction performance that surpassed common bottom-up algorithms, thus
providing a first proof that images (alone) can be leveraged to predict
validated suicide risk. Corresponding with the lead hypothesis, at-risk users
had images with increased negative emotions and decreased belonginess. The
results are discussed in the context of non-verbal warning signs of suicide.
Notably, the study illustrates the advantages of hybrid models in such
complicated tasks and provides simple and flexible prediction strategies that
could be utilized to develop real-life monitoring tools of suicide.

texture-free X-ray images remain underexplored, despite the widespread
application of X-ray imaging in safety-critical scenarios such as the X-ray
detection of prohibited items. In this paper, we take the first step toward the
study of adversarial attacks targeted at X-ray prohibited item detection, and
reveal the serious threats posed by such attacks in this safety-critical
scenario. Specifically, we posit that successful physical adversarial attacks
in this scenario should be specially designed to circumvent the challenges
posed by color/texture fading and complex overlapping. To this end, we propose
X-adv to generate physically printable metals that act as an adversarial agent
capable of deceiving X-ray detectors when placed in luggage. To resolve the
issues associated with color/texture fading, we develop a differentiable
converter that facilitates the generation of 3D-printable objects with
adversarial shapes, using the gradients of a surrogate model rather than
directly generating adversarial textures. To place the printed 3D adversarial
objects in luggage with complex overlapped instances, we design a policy-based
reinforcement learning strategy to find locations eliciting strong attack
performance in worst-case scenarios whereby the prohibited items are heavily
occluded by other items. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed X-Adv, we
conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and the physical world
(employing a commercial X-ray security inspection system for the latter case).
Furthermore, we present the physical-world X-ray adversarial attack dataset

weak, which is intrinsically limited by the weak particle-matter interaction
and unavoidably impedes the development of many promising applications, such as
the miniaturization of free-electron radiation sources and high-energy particle
detectors. Here we reveal a mechanism to enhance the particle-matter
interaction by exploiting the pseudo-Brewster effect of gain materials -
presenting an enhancement of at least four orders of magnitude for the light
emission. This mechanism is enabled by the emergence of an unprecedented phase
diagram that maps all phenomena of free-electron radiation into three distinct
phases in a gain-thickness parameter space, namely the conventional,
intermediate, and Brewster phases, when an electron penetrates a dielectric
slab with a modest gain and a finite thickness. Essentially, our revealed
mechanism corresponds to the free-electron radiation in the Brewster phase,
which also uniquely features ultrahigh directionality, always at the Brewster
angle, regardless of the electron velocity. Counterintuitively, we find that
the intensity of this free-electron Brewster radiation is insensitive to the
Fabry-Perot resonance condition and thus the variation of slab thickness, and
moreover, a weaker gain could lead to a stronger enhancement for the light
emission. The scheme of free-electron Brewster radiation, especially along with
its compatibility with low-energy electrons, may enable the development of
high-directionality high-intensity light sources at any frequency.

Most of the existing works address the problem by either enhancing the features

In this paper, we try to look into the root cause of the LTR task, i.e.,
training samples for each class are greatly imbalanced, and propose a
straightforward solution. We split the categories into three groups, i.e.,
many, medium and few, according to the number of training images. The three
groups of categories are separately predicted to reduce the difficulty for

given sample to the right class groups? We introduce a mutual exclusive
modulator which can estimate the probability of an image belonging to each
group. Particularly, the modulator consists of a light-weight module and
learned with a mutual exclusive objective. Hence, the output probabilities of
the modulator encode the data volume clues of the training dataset. They are
further utilized as prior information to guide the prediction of the
classifier. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets, e.g.,

finding appropriate U parameters for a given system is non-trivial and usually
requires computationally intensive and cumbersome first-principles
calculations. In this Letter, we address this issue by building a machine
learning (ML) model to predict material-specific U parameters only from the
structural information. An ML model is trained for the Mn-O chemical system by
calibrating their DFT+U electronic structures with the hybrid functional
results of more than Mn-O 3000 structures. The model allows us to determine a
reliable U value (MAE=0.128 eV, R2=0.97) for any given structure at nearly no
computational cost; yet the obtained U value is as good as that obtained from
the conventional first-principles methods. Further analysis reveals that the U
value is primarily determined by the local chemical structure, especially the
bond lengths, and this property is well captured by the ML model developed in
this work. This concept of the ML U model is universally applicable and can
considerably ease the usage of the DFT+U method by providing

a direct projection alternative to the classic backfitting method by Buja,
Hastie and Tibshirani. This paper translates the original smooth backfitting
concept to a survival model considering an additively structured hazard. The
model allows for censoring and truncation patterns occurring in many
applications such as medical studies or actuarial reserving. Our estimators are
shown to be a projection of the data into the space of multivariate hazard
functions with smooth additive components. Hence, our hazard estimator is the
closest nonparametric additive fit even if the actual hazard rate is not
additive. This is different to other additive structure estimators where it is
not clear what is being estimated if the model is not true. We provide full
asymptotic theory for our estimators. We provide an implementation the proposed
estimators that show good performance in practice even for high dimensional
covariates.

resource allocation, policymaking, and scientific explorations. However,
privacy issues make it challenging for users to share their information unless

mechanism to release helpful information while protecting individuals' privacy.
However, most DP mechanisms only consider a fixed compensation for each user's
privacy loss. In this paper, we design a task assignment scheme that allows
workers to dynamically improve their utility with dynamic distance privacy
leakage. Specifically, we propose two solutions to improve the total utility of
task assignment results, namely Private Utility Conflict-Elimination (PUCE)
approach and Private Game Theory (PGT) approach, respectively. We prove that
PUCE achieves higher utility than the state-of-the-art works. We demonstrate
the efficiency and effectiveness of our PUCE and PGT approaches on both real

Private Distance Conflict-Elimination (PDCE). PUCE is always better than PDCE
slightly. PGT is 50% to 63% faster than PDCE and can improve 16% utility on
average when worker range is large enough.

solved without exhaustive search, which implies a weaker conclusion P $\neq$
NP. This constructive approach for proving impossibility results is very
different (and missing) from those currently used in computational complexity
theory, but is similar to that used by Kurt G\""{o}del in proving his famous
logical impossibility results. Just as shown by G\""{o}del's results that
proving formal unprovability is feasible in mathematics, the results of this
paper show that proving computational hardness is not hard in mathematics.
Specifically, proving lower bounds for many problems, such as 3-SAT, can be
challenging because these problems have various effective strategies available
for avoiding exhaustive search. However, in cases of extremely hard examples,
exhaustive search may be the only viable option, and proving its necessity
becomes more straightforward. Consequently, it makes the separation between SAT
(with long clauses) and 3-SAT much easier than that between 3-SAT and 2-SAT.
Finally, the main results of this paper demonstrate that the fundamental

We demonstrate that the interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) $EuSn_2As_2$ of

responses. Moreover, the bilayer AFM $EuSn_2As_2$ not only displays distinct
BPVE responses when magnetic moments align in different directions, but also
shows symmetry-related responses in two phases which have mutually
perpendicular in-plane magnetic moments. Due to the dependence of BPVE
responses on the polarization of light and magnetic symmetry, these magnetic

well-designed experiments. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of the BPVE

Eventually, the neutrino dark matter undergoes freeze-out in the dark sector,
which can occur in both non-relativistic and relativistic regimes. To account
for the latter possibility, we use the full Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein

the allowed dark matter masses extend to $10^4$ TeV without conflicting

millions of people across the globe. MS can critically affect different organs

  Background: To help physicians in diagnosing MS lesions, computer-aided
methods are widely used. In this regard, a considerable research has been
carried out in the area of automatic detection and segmentation of MS lesions
in magnetic resonance images (MRIs).
  Methodology: In this study, we review the different approaches that have been
used in computer-aided detection and segmentation of MS lesions. Our review
resulted in categorizing MS lesion segmentation approaches into six broad
categories: data-driven, statistical, supervised machine learning, unsupervised
machine learning, fuzzy, and deep learning-based techniques. We critically
analyze the different techniques under these approaches and highlight their
strengths and weaknesses.
  Results: From the study, we observe that a considerable amount of work,
around 25% of related literature, is focused on statistical-based MS lesion
segmentation techniques, followed by 21.15% for data-driven based methods,
19.23% for deep learning and 15.38% for supervised methods.
  Implication: The study points out the challenges/gaps to be addressed in
future research. The study shows the work which has been done in last one
decade in detection and segmentation of MS lesions. The results show that, in
recent years, deep learning methods are outperforming all the others methods.

in-depth carrier injection. Yet, the effects of in-depth carrier injection on
the transient currents and optical absorption have not yet been elucidated
theoretically. Here, by considering the in-depth carrier injection in
simulations, we found a 1/t^{1-alpha/2} initial time (t) dependence rather than
the conventional $1/t^{1-alpha}$ dependence under a weak external electric
field, where alpha<1 is the index of dispersive diffusion.The asymptotic
transient currents are not influenced by the initial in-depth carrier injection
and follow the conventional 1/t^{1+alpha} time dependence. We also present the
relation between the field-dependent mobility coefficient and the diffusion
coefficient when the transport is dispersive. The field dependence of the
transport coefficients influences the transit time in the photocurrent kinetics
dividing two power-law decay regimes. The classical Scher--Montroll theory
predicts a_1+a_2=2 when the initial photocurrent decay is given by 1/t^{a_1}

tickets' textual similarity to detect duplication; however, duplicate tickets

propose iPACK, an incident-aware method for aggregating duplicate tickets by
fusing the failure information between the customer side (i.e., tickets) and
the cloud side (i.e., incidents). We extensively evaluate iPACK on three

model order so that the training data are fitted well while redundant degrees
of freedom without conditions and sufficient data to fix them are automatically
eliminated. The models are formulated via solution matrices of specific
instances of generalized Sylvester equations that enforce interpolation of the

The proposed method numerically solves the Sylvester equations for minimal-rank

that the combination of structure preservation and rank minimization leads to
accurate models with orders of magnitude fewer degrees of freedom than models
of comparable prediction quality that are learned with structure preservation

departures from chemical equilibrium (CE) due to the dynamical motions of the

Learning (MARL). Previous studies try to resolve the issue through designing an
intrinsic reward function, but the intrinsic reward is simply combined with the
environment reward by summation in these studies, which makes the performance
of their MARL framework unsatisfactory. We propose a novel method named
Attention Individual Intrinsic Reward Mixing Network (AIIR-MIX) in MARL, and
the contributions of AIIR-MIX are listed as follows:(a) we construct a novel
intrinsic reward network based on the attention mechanism to make teamwork more
effective. (b) we propose a Mixing network that is able to combine intrinsic
and extrinsic rewards non-linearly and dynamically in response to changing
conditions of the environment. We compare AIIR-MIX with many State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) MARL methods on battle games in StarCraft II. And the results
demonstrate that AIIR-MIX performs admirably and can defeat the current
advanced methods on average test win rate. To validate the effectiveness of
AIIR-MIX, we conduct additional ablation studies. The results show that
AIIR-MIX can dynamically assign each agent a real-time intrinsic reward in
accordance with their actual contribution.

semi-supervised Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by generating additional
pseudo-labels based on confident predictions. However, the quality of generated
pseudo-labels has long been a concern due to the sensitivity of the
classification objective to given labels. To avoid the untrustworthy
classification supervision indicating ``a node belongs to a specific class,''
we favor the fault-tolerant contrasting supervision demonstrating ``two nodes
do not belong to the same class.'' Thus, the problem of generating high-quality
pseudo-labels is then transformed into a relaxed version, i.e., finding
reliable contrasting pairs. To achieve this, we propose a general framework for
GNNs, termed Pseudo Contrastive Learning (PCL). It separates two nodes whose
positive and negative pseudo-labels target the same class. To incorporate
topological knowledge into learning, we devise a topologically weighted
contrastive loss that spends more effort separating negative pairs with smaller
topological distances. Additionally, to alleviate the heavy reliance on data
augmentation, we augment nodes only by applying dropout to the encoded
representations. Theoretically, we prove that PCL with the lightweight
augmentation works like a representation regularizer to effectively learn
separation between negative pairs. Experimentally, we employ PCL on various
models, which consistently outperform their counterparts using other popular
general techniques on five real-world graphs.

specifically designed to evaluate the quality of service (QoS) experienced by a
typical ground user equipment (UE) residing either inside or outside a generic
area affected by a calamity. In particular, we model the functioning
terrestrial base stations (TBSs) as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process
(IPPP), and assume that a given number of uniformly distributed unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) equipped with cellular transceivers is deployed in order to
compensate for the damage suffered by some of the existing TBSs. The downlink
(DL) coverage probability is then derived based on the maximum average received
power association policy and the assumption of Nakagami-m fading conditions for
all wireless links. The proposed numerical results show insightful trends in
terms of coverage probability, depending on: distance of the UE from the
disaster epicenter, disaster radius, quality of resilience (QoR) of the
terrestrial network, and fleet of deployed ad-hoc aerial base stations (ABSs).
The aim of this paper is therefore to prove the effectiveness of vertical
heterogeneous networks (VHetNets) in emergency scenarios, which can both
stimulate the involved authorities for their implementation and inspire
researchers to further investigate related problems.

155 million user comments in 55 political subforums on Reddit between 2010 and
2018 to explore whether users' style of political discussion aligns with the
essential components of deliberative, civic, and demagogic discourse. Second,
we perform a quantitative study that combines confirmatory factor analysis with

mechanism schemes (e.g., upvotes only, upvotes and downvotes, no reaction
mechanisms) correspond with political user discussion that is more or less

main takeaways. First, despite being ""ideal constructs of political rhetoric,""
we find that political discourse theories describe political discussions on
Reddit to a large extent. Second, we find that discussions in subforums with
only upvotes, or both up- and downvotes are associated with user discourse that
is more deliberate and civic. Third, social media discussions are most
demagogic in subreddits with no reaction mechanisms at all. These findings
offer valuable contributions for ongoing policy discussions on the relationship

fast operation frequencies and field robustness. Despite the rapid progress in
proof-of-principle functionality in recent years, there has been a notable lack
of understanding of antiferromagnetic domain formation and manipulation, which
translates to either incomplete or non-scalable control of the magnetic order.
Here, we demonstrate simple and functional ways of influencing the domain
structure in CuMnAs and Mn2Au, two key materials of antiferromagnetic
spintronics research, using device patterning and strain engineering. Comparing
x-ray microscopy data from two different materials, we reveal the key
parameters dictating domain formation in antiferromagnetic devices and show how
the non-trivial interaction of magnetostriction, substrate clamping and edge
anisotropy leads to specific equilibrium domain configurations. More
specifically, we observe that patterned edges have a significant impact on the
magnetic anisotropy and domain structure over long distances, and we propose a
theoretical model that relates short-range edge anisotropy and long-range
magnetoelastic interactions. The principles invoked are of general
applicability to the domain formation and engineering in antiferromagnetic thin
films at large, which will pave the way towards realizing truly functional
antiferromagnetic devices.

Furthermore, purely deterministic, algorithm-based approaches may expose the

  In this paper, we present ""Auto.gov"", a learning-based on-chain governance

approach to propose semi-automated, intuitive governance proposals with
quantitative justifications. This methodology enables the system to efficiently
adapt to and mitigate the negative impact of malicious behaviors, such as price

deblurring and deraining. In the process of image restoration, it is necessary
to consider not only the spatial details and contextual information of
restoration to ensure the quality, but also the system complexity. Although
many methods have been able to guarantee the quality of image restoration, the
system complexity of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods is increasing as well.
Motivated by this, we present a mixed hierarchy network that can balance these
competing goals. Our main proposal is a mixed hierarchy architecture, that
progressively recovers contextual information and spatial details from degraded
images while we design intra-blocks to reduce system complexity. Specifically,
our model first learns the contextual information using encoder-decoder
architectures, and then combines them with high-resolution branches that
preserve spatial detail. In order to reduce the system complexity of this
architecture for convenient analysis and comparison, we replace or remove the
nonlinear activation function with multiplication and use a simple network
structure. In addition, we replace spatial convolution with global
self-attention for the middle block of encoder-decoder. The resulting tightly
interlinked hierarchy architecture, named as MHNet, delivers strong performance
gains on several image restoration tasks, including image deraining, and
deblurring.

potential to enable all-electron plane-wave calculations [J. Chem. Theory

the Schr\""odinger equation for the wave function ansatz
$\phi(\boldsymbol{r})=\exp[-h(\boldsymbol{r})]/\sqrt{\pi}$ with
$h(\boldsymbol{r})=r\text{erf}(ar)+b\exp(-a^{2}r^{2})$, where $a$ and $b$ are
parameters. Gygi fixes $b$ by demanding $\phi$ to be normalized, the value
$b(a)$ depending on the strength of the regularization controlled by $a$. We
begin this work by re-examining the determination of $b(a)$ and find that the
original 10-decimal tabulations of Gygi are only correct to 5 decimals, leading
to normalization errors in the order of $10^{-10}$. In contrast, we show that a
simple 100-point radial quadrature scheme not only ensures at least 10 correct
decimals of $b$, but also leads to machine-precision level satisfaction of the
normalization condition.
  Moreover, we extend Gygi's plane-wave study by examining the accuracy of
$V(r)$ with high-precision finite element calculations with Hartree-Fock and
LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA functionals on first- to fifth-period atoms. We find
that although the convergence of the total energy appears slow in the
regularization parameter $a$, orbital energies and shapes are indeed reproduced
accurately by the regularized potential even with relatively small values of
$a$, as compared to results obtained with a point nucleus. The accuracy of the
potential is furthermore studied with $s$-$d$ excitation energies of Sc--Cu as
well as ionization potentials of He--Kr, which are found to converge to sub-meV
precision with $a=4$. The findings of this work are in full support of Gygi's
contribution, indicating that all-electron plane-wave calculations can be
accurately performed with the regularized nuclear potential.

Debates on its representativeness, usefulness, and whether the effort spent on

learning is modeling; hence, arriving at a contradiction if models are not
useful. Representing biological systems through mathematical models can be
difficult but the modeling procedure is a process in itself that follows a
semi-formal set of rules. Although seldom reported, failure in modeling is not
a rare event but I argue that this is usually a result of erroneous underlying
knowledge or misapplication of a model beyond its intended purpose. I argue
that in many biological studies, simulation is the only experimental tool. In
others, simulation is a means of reducing possible combinations of experimental
work; thereby, presenting an economical case for simulation; thus, worthwhile
to engage in this endeavor. The representativeness of simulation depends on the
validation, verification, assumptions, and limitations of the underlying model.
This will be illustrated using the inter-relationship between population,

investigation on the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a small VAWT with

Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes SST k-omega turbulence model and the FW-H
method is verified against experiments. The studied V-shaped blades can
effectively improve the power performance of VAWT over a wide range of tip
speed ratios under normal wind speed conditions, and the trailing-edge
serrations will also slightly increase the power output of V-bladed VAWT at the
optimal tip speed ratio. The power coefficient of the V-bladed wind turbine

can also be flexibly integrated into common instance segmentation

We implemented a model, termed as SEMI-PointRend, to generate precise

SEMI-PointRend and Mask-RCNN for various defect types (line-collapse, single

(Q) without accessing the real data, but generates the fake sample via a
generator (G) by learning from full-precision network (P) instead. However,
such sample generation process is totally independent of Q, specialized as
failing to consider the adaptability of the generated samples, i.e., beneficial
or adversarial, over the learning process of Q, resulting into non-ignorable
performance loss. Building on this, several crucial questions -- how to measure
and exploit the sample adaptability to Q under varied bit-width scenarios? how
to generate the samples with desirable adaptability to benefit the quantized
network? -- impel us to revisit DFQ. In this paper, we answer the above
questions from a game-theory perspective to specialize DFQ as a zero-sum game
between two players -- a generator and a quantized network, and further propose
an Adaptability-aware Sample Generation (AdaSG) method. Technically, AdaSG
reformulates DFQ as a dynamic maximization-vs-minimization game process
anchored on the sample adaptability. The maximization process aims to generate
the sample with desirable adaptability, such sample adaptability is further
reduced by the minimization process after calibrating Q for performance
recovery. The Balance Gap is defined to guide the stationarity of the game
process to maximally benefit Q. The theoretical analysis and empirical studies
verify the superiority of AdaSG over the state-of-the-arts. Our code is

that the most commonly used cross-entropy (CE) loss does not guarantee robust

decision boundary to achieve a lower loss, rather than pushing the boundary to
a more robust position. A robust boundary should be kept in the middle of
samples from different classes, thus maximizing the margins from the boundary
to the samples. We think this is due to the fact that CE loss has no stationary
point. In this paper, we propose a family of new losses, called stationary
point (SP) loss, which has at least one stationary point on the correct
classification side. We proved that robust boundary can be guaranteed by SP
loss without losing much accuracy. With SP loss, larger perturbations are
required to generate adversarial examples. We demonstrate that robustness is
improved under a variety of adversarial attacks by applying SP loss. Moreover,
robust boundary learned by SP loss also performs well on imbalanced datasets.

the effect of metallicity on the quenched abundance for a range of parameters
(temperature: 500-2500 K, pressure: 10$^{-4}$-10$^3$ bar, metallicity: 0.1-1000
$\times$ solar metallicity). We determine the chemical timescale by finding
rate limiting steps in a reduced chemical network with a network analysis tool
and the thermochemical equilibrium abundance. The equilibrium abundance results
are similar to the literature. The CO, H$_2$O, and CO$_2$ abundances increase
with metallicity in the parameter range considered. The CH$_4$ abundance
increases with metallicity for CO/CH$_4$ $<$ 1 and is unaffected for CO/CH$_4$
$>$ 1. The chemical timescale of CO shows minimal change with the metallicity,
while the CH$_4$ chemical timescale is inversely proportional to atmospheric
metallicity. The quench level of CO shifts into the high-pressure region, and
the quench level of CH$_4$ shows complex behavior with metallicity. We
benchmarked the quenching approximation with the 1D photochemistry-transport

results in UC H II regions and previous observation results on high-mass
starless cores and high-mass protostellar cores, the N(HC3N)/N(N2H+) ratio
clearly increases from the region stage. This means that the abundance ratio
changes with the evolution of high-mass star-forming regions (HMSFRs).
Moreover, positive correlations between the ratio and other evolutionary
indicators (dust temperature, bolometric luminosity, and luminosity-to-mass
ratio) are found. Thus we propose the ratio of N(HC3N)/N(N2H+) as a reliable

specifically federated learning, are vulnerable to security and privacy attacks
such as model inference and backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are a group of
poisoning attacks in which the attacker tries to control the model output by
manipulating the model's training process. While there have been studies
regarding inference attacks on split learning, it has not yet been tested for
backdoor attacks. This paper performs a novel backdoor attack on split learning
and studies its effectiveness. Despite traditional backdoor attacks done on the
client side, we inject the backdoor trigger from the server side. For this
purpose, we provide two attack methods: one using a surrogate client and
another using an autoencoder to poison the model via incoming smashed data and
its outgoing gradient toward the innocent participants. We did our experiments
using three model architectures and three publicly available datasets in the
image domain and ran a total of 761 experiments to evaluate our attack methods.
The results show that despite using strong patterns and injection methods,
split learning is highly robust and resistant to such poisoning attacks. While
we get the attack success rate of 100% as our best result for the MNIST
dataset, in most of the other cases, our attack shows little success when
increasing the cut layer.

suitable kernels should model joint spatial and temporal dependence. Separable
space-time covariance kernels offer simplicity and computational efficiency.
However, non-separable kernels include space-time interactions that better
capture observed correlations. Most non-separable kernels that admit explicit
expressions are based on mathematical considerations (admissibility conditions)
rather than first-principles derivations. We present a hybrid spectral approach
for generating covariance kernels which is based on physical arguments. We use
this approach to derive a new class of physically motivated, non-separable
covariance kernels which have their roots in the stochastic, linear, damped,
harmonic oscillator (LDHO). The new kernels incorporate functions with both
monotonic and oscillatory decay of space-time correlations. The LDHO covariance
kernels involve space-time interactions which are introduced by dispersion
relations that modulate the oscillator coefficients. We derive explicit

Furthermore, the LLM-based conceptual structure revealed a human-like reliance
on 14 underlying conceptual attributes of emotions for emotion inference. Most

corresponding LLM's emotion inference performance deteriorated, and the
performance deterioration was correlated to the effectiveness of

tasks in robot perception and machine learning, such as for evaluating the
performance of an object tracker or training an image-based object detector.
The accuracy of the annotated instances of the moving objects on every image
frame in a video is crucially important. Achieving that through manual
annotations is not only very time consuming and labor intensive, but is also
prone to high error rate. State-of-the-art annotation methods depend on
manually initializing the object bounding boxes only in the first frame and
then use classical tracking methods, e.g., adaboost, or kernelized correlation
filters, to keep track of those bounding boxes. These can quickly drift,
thereby requiring tedious manual supervision. In this paper, we propose a new
annotation method which leverages a combination of a learning-based detector
(SSD) and a learning-based tracker (RE$^3$). Through this, we significantly
reduce annotation drifts, and, consequently, the required manual supervision.

  Raw Agricultural Product Sales",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uncertainty in quality and the inspectors' imperfect testing capability leave
raw agricultural products (e.g., fresh produce, seafood, livestock and poultry
products, etc.) wide open to economically motivated adulteration (EMA), and the
strong demand for online shopping of these products in China makes this
situation even worse. In this paper, we develop a game-theoretic framework to
investigate online raw agricultural product sellers' preemptive EMA behavior on
an ecommerce platform (EP). Particularly, the sellers differ from each other in
the original quality of their products. We characterize the sellers'
equilibrium pricing and adulteration decisions and the EP's optimal take rate
decision, and analyze how the sampling inspections and adulteration penalty
jointly impact these decisions. Moreover, we investigate three managerial
levers, such as claiming a higher-than-law-requires penalty, that the
administrative departments or the EP can use to deter EMA. Finally, we use the
real-word data from Taobao.com to calibrate our model and derive more
managerial insights from the analytical findings. We find that the heterogenous
sellers' adulteration decisions are symmetric and their ex-post pricing
decisions lead them to evenly share the market on the EP. Interestingly, we
show that the EP's higher take rate will inhibit the sellers' adulteration
behavior. However, the profit-maximizing EP may indulge the sellers'
adulteration behavior by intentionally decreasing this rate. Our results
highlight a penalty-inspection-centered approach as essential to combat EMA,
and the three levels can play a role as supplements to this approach under
certain conditions.

upon an ideal but impractical anchor set available to pre-estimate the noise

layer, the ill-posed stochastic learning of its parameters in back-propagation
easily falls into undesired local minimums. We solve this problem by
introducing a Latent Class-Conditional Noise model (LCCN) to parameterize the

the stable update of the noise transition, which avoids previous arbitrarily

discuss the matching conditions to local thermodynamical equilibrium,
symmetries of the energy-momentum tensor, decomposition of dissipative

we first formulate the first-order (Navier-Stokes) relativistic hydrodynamics
from the entropy flow equation, keeping only the first-order gradients of
thermodynamical forces. A generalized form of diffusion terms is found with a
matrix of diffusion coefficients describing the relative diffusion between
various flavors. The procedure of finding the dissipative terms is then
extended to the second order to obtain the most general form of dissipative
function for multiflavor systems up to the second order in dissipative fluxes.
The dissipative function now includes in addition to the usual second-order
transport coefficients of Israel-Stewart theory also second-order diffusion
between different flavors. The relaxation-type equations of second-order
hydrodynamics are found from the requirement of positivity of the dissipation
function, which features the finite relaxation times of various dissipative
processes that guarantee the causality and stability of the fluid dynamics.
These equations contain a complete set of nonlinear terms in the thermodynamic
gradients and dissipative fluxes arising from the entropy current, which are
not present in the conventional Israel-Stewart theory.

critical for successful applications of visual reinforcement learning (VRL) in
real scenarios. A widely used idea is to learn task-relevant representations
that encode task-relevant information of common features in POMDPs, i.e.,
rewards and transition dynamics. As transition dynamics in the latent state
space -- which are task-relevant and invariant to visual distractions -- are
unknown to the agents, existing methods alternatively use transition dynamics
in the observation space to extract task-relevant information in transition
dynamics. However, such transition dynamics in the observation space involve
task-irrelevant visual distractions, degrading the generalization performance
of VRL methods. To tackle this problem, we propose the reward sequence
distribution conditioned on the starting observation and the predefined
subsequent action sequence (RSD-OA). The appealing features of RSD-OA include
that: (1) RSD-OA is invariant to visual distractions, as it is conditioned on
the predefined subsequent action sequence without task-irrelevant information
from transition dynamics, and (2) the reward sequence captures long-term
task-relevant information in both rewards and transition dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that our representation learning approach based on RSD-OA
significantly improves the generalization performance on unseen environments,
outperforming several state-of-the-arts on DeepMind Control tasks with visual

is governed by the sum of trigonometric and exponential functions, where the
latter captures the linear variation in lift coefficient within the small-angle

an empirical relation between the location of the center of pressure and the

formulas (i.e. CL and CD) to evaluate the pitching moment coefficient, CM
({\alpha}), about any arbitrary axis. These quasi-steady formulations are then
utilized to simulate forward flight of a model that possesses dynamical
characteristics of a pigeon across various flight speeds, and the results are

how, while Isotropic NCA are orientation-agnostic, Steerable NCA have

procedure and involves two simple steps in each iteration -- generating noisy
data based on the core tensor from the Tucker decomposition of the updated
parameter estimate and running a regular GLM on noise-augmented data on
vectorized predictors. We demonstrate the implementation of NA$_0$CT$^2$ and
its $\ell_0$ regularization effect in both simulation studies and real data
applications. The results suggest that NA$_0$CT$^2$ improves predictions
compared to other decomposition-based TR approaches, with or without
regularization and it also helps to identify important predictors though not
designed for that purpose.

Galerkin (HDG) method, using patches of standard simplicial elements that can
have non-matching interfaces. Coupled via the HDG technique, our method enables
local refinement by uniform simplicial subdivision of each macro-element. By
enforcing one spatial discretization for all macro-elements, we arrive at local
problems per macro-element that are embarrassingly parallel, yet well balanced.
Therefore, our macro-element variant scales efficiently to n-node clusters and
can be tailored to available hardware by adjusting the local problem size to
the capacity of a single node, while still using moderate polynomial orders
such as quadratics or cubics. Increasing the local problem size means
simultaneously decreasing, in relative terms, the global problem size, hence
effectively limiting the proliferation of degrees of freedom. The global
problem is solved via a matrix-free iterative technique that also heavily
relies on macro-element local operations. We investigate and discuss the
advantages and limitations of the macro-element HDG method via an
advection-diffusion model problem.

the management evolve greatly in recent years. Field-in-field and IMRT

preserve organs at risk by minimising the doses delivered to them. If
arctherapy allows a considerable reduction of high doses received by healthy

wavenumber of the driving pseudoforce matches that of the surface plasmon
excitations which can be either due to single-electrons or collective effects.

to use for the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) in nanometer sized
metallic surfaces in non-planar geometry. A new equation of state (EoS) for the

explain why metallic elements do not show collective behavior at low

  Representative Graphs","24 pages",,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  We describe SynGraphy, a method for visually summarising the structure of
large network datasets that works by drawing smaller graphs generated to have
similar structural properties to the input graphs. Visualising complex networks
is crucial to understand and make sense of networked data and the relationships
it represents. Due to the large size of many networks, visualisation is
extremely difficult; the simple method of drawing large networks like those of
Facebook or Twitter leads to graphics that convey little or no information.
While modern graph layout algorithms can scale computationally to large
networks, their output tends to a common ""hairball"" look, which makes it
difficult to even distinguish different graphs from each other. Graph sampling
and graph coarsening techniques partially address these limitations but they
are only able to preserve a subset of the properties of the original graphs. In
this paper we take the problem of visualising large graphs from a novel
perspective: we leave the original graph's nodes and edges behind, and instead
summarise its properties such as the clustering coefficient and bipartivity by
generating a completely new graph whose structural properties match that of the
original graph. To verify the utility of this approach as compared to other
graph visualisation algorithms, we perform an experimental evaluation in which
we repeatedly asked experimental subjects (professionals in graph mining and
related areas) to determine which of two given graphs has a given structural
property and then assess which visualisation algorithm helped in identifying
the correct answer. Our summarisation approach SynGraphy compares favourably to
other techniques on a variety of networks.

for incompressible binary fluids following the generalized Onsager principle
and Boussinesq approximation. This model preserves not only the volume of each
fluid phase but also the positive entropy production rate under
thermodynamically consistent boundary conditions. Guided by the thermodynamical
consistency of the model, a set of second order structure-preserving numerical
algorithms are devised to solve the governing partial differential equations
along with consistent boundary conditions in the model, which preserve the
entropy production rate as well as the volume of each fluid phase at the
discrete level. Several numerical simulations are carried out using an
efficient adaptive time-stepping strategy based on one of the
structure-preserving schemes to simulate the Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection in
the binary fluid and interfacial dynamics between two immiscible fluids under
competing effects of the temperature gradient, gravity, and interfacial forces.
Roll cell patterns and thermally induced mixing of binary fluids are observed
in a rectangular region with insulated lateral boundaries and vertical ones
with imposed temperature difference. Long time simulations of interfacial
dynamics are performed demonstrating robust results of new structure-preserving
schemes.

computationally efficient approach for predicting spectral properties with an
orbital-density-dependent functional formulation. These functionals address two
fundamental issues with density functional theory (DFT). First, while Kohn-Sham
eigenvalues can loosely mirror experimental quasiparticle energies, they are
not meant to reproduce excitation energies and there is formally no connection
between the two (except for the HOMO for the exact functional). Second,
(semi-)local DFT deviates from the expected piecewise linear behavior of the
energy as a function of the total number of electrons. This can make
eigenvalues an even poorer proxy for quasiparticle energies and, together with
the absence of the exchange-correlation derivative discontinuity, contributes
to DFT's underestimation of band gaps. By enforcing a generalized piecewise
linearity condition to the entire electronic manifold, Koopmans functionals
yield molecular orbital energies and solid-state band structures with
comparable accuracy to many-body perturbation theory but at greatly reduced
computational cost and preserving a functional formulation. This paper
introduces ""koopmans"", an open-source package that contains all of the code and
workflows needed to perform Koopmans functional calculations without requiring

afterglow of GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever observed.
This includes the first mid-IR spectra of any GRB, obtained with JWST/NIRSPEC
(0.6-5.5 micron) and MIRI (5-12 micron), 12 days after the burst. Assuming that
the intrinsic spectral slope is a single power-law, with $F_{\nu} \propto
\nu^{-\beta}$, we obtain $\beta \approx 0.35$, modified by substantial dust
extinction with $A_V = 4.9$. This suggests extinction above the notional
Galactic value, possibly due to patchy extinction within the Milky Way or dust
in the GRB host galaxy. It further implies that the X-ray and optical/IR
regimes are not on the same segment of the synchrotron spectrum of the
afterglow. If the cooling break lies between the X-ray and optical/IR, then the
temporal decay rates would only match a post jet-break model, with electron
index $p<2$, and with the jet expanding into a uniform ISM medium. The shape of
the JWST spectrum is near-identical in the optical/nIR to X-shooter
spectroscopy obtained at 0.5 days and to later time observations with HST. The
lack of spectral evolution suggests that any accompanying supernova (SN) is
either substantially fainter or bluer than SN 1998bw, the proto-type GRB-SN.
Our HST observations also reveal a disc-like host galaxy, viewed close to
edge-on, that further complicates the isolation of any supernova component. The
host galaxy appears rather typical amongst long-GRB hosts and suggests that the
extreme properties of GRB 221009A are not directly tied to its galaxy-scale

  using sentiment analysis","34 pages, 7 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There is growing concern that over the past decade, industrialized democratic
nations are becoming increasingly politically polarized. Indeed, elections in
the US, UK, France, and Germany have all seen tightly won races, with notable
examples including the 2016 Trump vs. Clinton presidential election and the
UK's Brexit referendum. However, while there has been much qualitative
discussion of polarization on key issues, there are few examples of formal
quantitative assessments examining this topic. Therefore, in this paper, we
undertake a statistical evaluation of political polarization for
representatives elected to the US congress on key policy issues between
2021-2022. The method is based on applying sentiment analysis to Twitter data
and developing quantitative analysis for six political groupings defined based
on voting records. Two sets of policy groups are explored, including
geopolitical policies (e.g., Ukraine-Russia, China, Taiwan, etc.) and domestic
policies (e.g., abortion, climate change, LGBTQ, immigration, etc.). We find
that out of the twelve policies explored here, gun control was the most
politically polarizing, with significant polarization results found for all
groups (four of which were P < 0.001). The next most polarizing issues include
immigration and border control, fossil fuels, and Ukraine-Russia.
Interestingly, the least polarized policy topics were Taiwan, LGBTQ, and the
Chinese Communist Party, potentially demonstrating the highest degree of
bipartisanship on these issues. The results can be used to guide future policy
making, by helping to identify areas of common ground across political groups.

cause high mechanical stresses, especially if the battery active particle
cannot expand freely. In this article, a thermodynamically consistent continuum
model for coupling chemical and mechanical effects of electrode particles is
extended by a change in the boundary condition for the displacement via a
variational inequality. This switch represents a limited enlargement of the
particle swelling or shrinking due to lithium intercalation or deintercalation
in the host material, respectively. For inequality constraints as boundary
condition a smaller time step size is need as well as a locally finer mesh. The
combination of a primal-dual active set algorithm, interpreted as semismooth
Newton method, and a spatial and temporal adaptive algorithm allows the
efficient numerical investigation based on a finite element method. Using the
example of silicon, the chemical and mechanical behavior of one- and
two-dimensional representative geometries for a charge-discharge cycle is
investigated. Furthermore, the efficiency of the adaptive algorithm is
demonstrated. It turns out that the size of the gap has an significant
influence on the maximal stress value and the slope of the increase. Especially
in two dimension, the obstacle can cause an additional region with a

been inaccessible to them so far. Here, we use four-wave mixing in a
xenon-filled single-ring photonic crystal fiber to generate biphotons with one
of the photons in the ultraviolet and its entangled partner in the infrared
spectral range. We tune the biphotons in frequency by varying the gas pressure
inside the fiber and thus tailoring the fiber dispersion landscape. The
ultraviolet photons are tunable from 271 nm to 235 nm and their entangled
partners, from 764 nm to 1342 nm, respectively. The tunability up to 170 THz is
achieved by adjusting the gas pressure by only 0.57 bar. At 1.32 bar, the
photons of a pair are separated by more than 2 octaves. The access to
ultraviolet wavelengths opens the possibility for spectroscopy and sensing with
undetected photons in this spectral range.

Given current constraints from asteroseismology, the core rotation rate of

setting. Individuals are situated on two layers of networks: the disease
transmission network layer and the peer influence network layer. The disease
spreads through direct close contacts while vaccine views and uptake behaviors
spread interpersonally within a potentially virtual network. The results of our
comprehensive simulations show that network-based targeting with pro-vaccine
supporters as initial seeds significantly influences vaccine adoption rates and
reduces the extent of an epidemic outbreak. Network targeting interventions are
much more effective by selecting individuals with a central position in the

galaxies. Various schemes to include it in galaxy evolution models exist,
generally assuming that the Toomre $Q$ parameter is self-regulated to
$Q_\mathrm{crit}$, the critical $Q$ dividing stable from unstable conditions in
a linear stability analysis. This assumption is in tension with observational
estimates of $Q$ that find values far below any plausible value of
$Q_\mathrm{crit}$. While the observations are subject to some uncertainty, this
tension can more easily be relieved on the theoretical side by relaxing the
common assumption that $Q\ge Q_\mathrm{crit}$. Based on observations of both
$z\sim 2$ disks and local face-on galaxies, we estimate the effect of
gravitational instability necessary to balance out every other physical process
that affects $Q$. In particular we find that the disk's response to low $Q$
values can be described by simple functions that depend only on $Q$. These
response functions allow galaxies to maintain $Q$ values below
$Q_\mathrm{crit}$ in equilibrium over a wide range of parameters. Extremely low
values of $Q$ are predicted when the gas surface density is greater than $\sim
10^3$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, the rotation curve provides minimal shear, the
orbital time becomes long, and/or when the gas is much more unstable than the

optimization problems. The focus is on the important class of low-rank matrix
sensing, where we propose an infinite hierarchy of non-convex problems via the
lifting technique and the Burer-Monteiro factorization. This contrasts with the
existing over-parametrization technique where the search rank is limited by the
dimension of the matrix and it does not allow a rich over-parametrization of an
arbitrary degree. We show that although the spurious solutions of the problem
remain stationary points through the hierarchy, they will be transformed into
strict saddle points (under some technical conditions) and can be escaped via
local search methods. This is the first result in the literature showing that
over-parametrization creates a negative curvature for escaping spurious
solutions. We also derive a bound on how much over-parametrization is requited
to enable the elimination of spurious solutions.

high investment and hence, operators are considering alternatives to optimize
the use of the existing capacity. This chapter introduces different planning
problems such as Routing and Spectrum Assignment problems, placement problems
for regenerators and wavelength converters, and how to offer resilience to
different failures. An overview of control and management is also provided.
Moreover, motivated by the increasing importance of data storage and data

spatiotemporal growth profiles may sculpt tissues into the same target 3D
shapes, but only specific growth patterns are observed in animal and plant
development. In particular, growth profiles may differ in their degree of
spatial variation and growth anisotropy, however, the criteria that distinguish
observed patterns of growth from other possible alternatives are not
understood. Here we exploit the mathematical formalism of quasiconformal
transformations to formulate the problem of ""growth pattern selection""
quantitatively in the context of 3D shape formation by growing 2D epithelial
sheets. We propose that nature settles on growth patterns that are the
'simplest' in a certain way. Specifically, we demonstrate that growth pattern
selection can be formulated as an optimization problem and solved for the
trajectories that minimize spatiotemporal variation in areal growth rates and
deformation anisotropy. The result is a complete prediction for the growth of
the surface, including not only a set of intermediate shapes, but also a
prediction for cell displacement along those surfaces in the process of growth.
Optimization of growth trajectories for both idealized surfaces and those
observed in nature show that relative growth rates can be uniformized at the
cost of introducing anisotropy. Minimizing the variation of programmed growth
rates can therefore be viewed as a generic mechanism for growth pattern
selection and may help to understand the prevalence of anisotropy in
developmental programs.

decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter
consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can
leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or
learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens
prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly
non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability,
thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to
them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows
ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing

the SigMA algorithm. The Sco-Cen star formation timeline reveals four periods
of enhanced star formation activity, or bursts, remarkably separated by about 5
Myr. Of these, the second burst, which occurred about 15 million years ago, is
by far the dominant, and most of Sco-Cen's stars and clusters were in place by
the end of this burst. The formation of stars and clusters in Sco-Cen is
correlated but not linearly, implying that more stars were formed per cluster
during the peak of the star formation rate. Most of the clusters that are large
enough to have supernova precursors were formed during the 15 Myr period. Star
and cluster formation activity has been continuously declining since then. We
have clear evidence that Sco-Cen formed from the inside out and contains 100-pc
long chains of contiguous clusters exhibiting well-defined age gradients, from
massive older clusters to smaller young clusters. These observables suggest an
important role for feedback in forming about half of Sco-Cen stars, although
follow-up work is needed to quantify this statement. Finally, we confirm that
the Upper-Sco age controversy discussed in the literature during the last
decades is solved: the nine clusters previously lumped together as Upper-Sco, a

can lead to severe disability and has no known cure. The majority of prior work
in machine learning for multiple sclerosis has been centered around using
Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans or laboratory tests; these modalities are both
expensive to acquire and can be unreliable. In a recent paper it was shown that
disease progression can be predicted effectively using performance outcome
measures (POMs) and demographic data. In our work we extend on this to focus on
the modeling side, using continuous time models on POMs and demographic data to
predict progression. We evaluate four continuous time models using a publicly
available multiple sclerosis dataset. We find that continuous models are often
able to outperform discrete time models. We also carry out an extensive
ablation to discover the sources of performance gains, we find that
standardizing existing features leads to a larger performance increase than
interpolating missing features.

a novel method, DiPMT, that provides a set of possible translations for a

find that LABs preferentially reside in regions of higher-than-average density
and are located in closer proximity to overdense structures, which represent
the sites of protoclusters and their substructures. Moreover, protoclusters
hosting one or more LABs tend to have a higher descendant mass than those which
do not. Blobs are also strongly associated with filaments of the cosmic web,
with $\sim$ 70% of the population being within a projected distance of 2.4 pMpc

real-time applications. The inference latency is further exacerbated by
autoregressive generative tasks, as models need to run iteratively to generate
tokens sequentially without leveraging token-level parallelization. To address
this, we propose Big Little Decoder (BiLD), a framework that can improve
inference efficiency and latency for a wide range of text generation

collaboratively generate text. The small model runs autoregressively to
generate text with a low inference cost, and the large model is only invoked
occasionally to refine the small model's inaccurate predictions in a
non-autoregressive manner. To coordinate the small and large models, BiLD
introduces two simple yet effective policies: (1) the fallback policy that
determines when to hand control over to the large model; and (2) the rollback
policy that determines when the large model needs to correct the small model's
inaccurate predictions. To evaluate our framework across different tasks and

these black holes, with zero cosmological coupling excluded at 99.98%
confidence. The redshift dependence of the mass growth implies that, at
$z\lesssim7$, black holes contribute an effectively constant cosmological
energy density to Friedmann's equations. The continuity equation then requires
that black holes contribute cosmologically as vacuum energy. We further show
that black hole production from the cosmic star formation history gives the
value of $\Omega_{\Lambda}$ measured by Planck while being consistent with
constraints from massive compact halo objects. We thus propose that stellar
remnant black holes are the astrophysical origin of dark energy, explaining the
onset of accelerating expansion at $z \sim 0.7$.

0.3\,M_{\odot}$ that is very likely a BH. The orbital period, $P_{\rm orb} =
1277$ days, is much longer than that of any previously studied BH binary. Our
radial velocity (RV) follow-up over a 7-month period spans more than 90% of the
orbit's dynamic range in RV and is in excellent agreement with predictions of
the Gaia solution. UV imaging and high-resolution optical spectra rule out all
plausible luminous companions that could explain the orbit. The star is a
bright ($G=12.3$), slightly metal-poor ($\rm [Fe/H]=-0.22$) low-luminosity

thin disk. We obtained X-ray and radio nondetections of the source near
periastron, which support BH accretion models in which the net accretion rate
at the horizon is much lower than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. At a distance

-- like that of Gaia BH1 -- seems too wide to have formed through common
envelope evolution. Gaia BH1 and BH2 have orbital periods at opposite edges of
the Gaia DR3 sensitivity curve, perhaps hinting at a bimodal intrinsic period
distribution for wide BH binaries. Dormant BH binaries like Gaia BH1 and Gaia
BH2 likely significantly outnumber their close, X-ray bright cousins, but their

during cluster mergers may also drive large-scale turbulence in the ICM, which
in turn generates extended synchrontron sources known as radio halos. Surface
brightness edges have been found numerous times in the thermal gas of clusters
based on X-ray observations. In contrast, edges in radio halos have only been

Cluster and the other 25 radio halos reported in the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster
Legacy Survey. To aid the identification of surface brightness discontinuities,
we applied a gradient-filtering edge-detection method to the radio images. We
find that the adopted filtering technique is helpful in identifying surface
brightness edges in radio images, allowing us to identify at least one gradient
in half of the radio halos studied. For the Bullet Cluster, we find excellent
agreement between the locations of the 4 radio discontinuities detected and the
X-ray edges. This similarity informs us that there is substantial interplay
between thermal and nonthermal components in galaxy clusters. This interplay is
likely due to the frozen-in ICM magnetic field, which mediates the advection of
cosmic rays while being dragged by thermal gas flows. We conclude that radio
halos are shaped by dynamical motions in the ICM and that they often display
surface brightness discontinuities, which appear to be co-located with edges in
the thermal gas emission. Our results demonstrate that new and future
generations of radio telescopes will provide a complementary approach to X-rays

matter (SIDM) models. To this end, we employ Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics +
N-body simulations to study idealised setups of equal- and unequal-mass mergers

offsets arising shortly after the first pericentre passage compared to DM-only
(DMO) simulations. But later on, e.g. at the first apocentre, the offsets can
be amplified by the presence of the ICM. Furthermore, we find that
cross-sections small enough not to be excluded by measurements of the core
sizes of relaxed galaxy clusters have a chance to produce observable offsets.
We found that different DM models affect the DM distribution and also the
galaxy and and ICM distribution, including its temperature. Potentially, the
position of the shock fronts, combined with the brightest cluster galaxies
(BCGs), provides further clues to the properties of DM. Overall our results
demonstrate that mergers of galaxy clusters at stages about the first apocentre
passage could be more interesting in terms of DM physics than those shortly
after the first pericentre passage. This may motivate further studies of
mergers at later evolutionary stages.

fractionalized spin liquid states. But the low temperature phase diagram is
dominated by states without fractionalization, with a competition between
superconductivity and charge-ordered states which break translational symmetry.
Our theory uncovers novel features associated with a particular spin-liquid
presumed to underlie the pseudogap metal, and shows that it has multiple
nearly-degenerate instabilities to confinement of fractionalized excitations,
leading to antiferromagnetism, $d$-wave superconductivity, and/or charge order.
Our theory provides routes to resolving a number of open puzzles on the cuprate
phase diagram.
  The spin liquid is described by a SU(2) gauge theory of $N_f=2$ massless
fundamental Dirac fermions, has an emergent SO(5)$_f$ global symmetry, and is
presumed to confine at low energies to the N\'eel state. At non-zero doping (or
smaller Hubbard repulsion at half-filling) we argue that confinement occurs via
the Higgs condensation of bosonic chargons carrying fundamental SU(2) gauge
charges moving in $\pi$ flux. At half-filling, the low energy Higgs sector has
$N_b=2$ relativistic bosons with a possible emergent SO(5)$_b$ global symmetry
describing rotations between a $d$-wave superconductor, period-2 charge
stripes, and the time-reversal breaking `$d$-density wave' state. We propose a
deconfined quantum critical point between a confining state which breaks
SO(5)$_f$ and a confining state which breaks SO(5)$_b$. The pattern of symmetry
breaking within both SO(5)s is determined by terms likely irrelevant at the
critical point, which can be chosen to obtain a transition between N\'eel order
and $d$-wave superconductivity. A similar theory applies at non-zero doping and
large $U$, with longer-range couplings of the chargons leading to charge order
with longer periods.

detecting the surviving remnants of such mergers, focusing on the case of
mergers of Carbon-Oxygen WDs. For $\sim 10^4$ yr, the merger remnant is
observationally similar to an extreme AGB star evolving to become a massive WD.
Identifying merger remnants is thus easiest in galaxies with high stellar
masses (high WD merger rate) and low star formation rates (low birth rate of
$\sim 6-10 \,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ stars). Photometrically identifying merger
remnants is challenging even in these cases because the merger remnants appear
similar to He stars and post-outburst classical novae. We propose that the most
promising technique for discovering WD merger remnants is through their unusual
surrounding photoionized nebulae. We use CLOUDY photoionization calculations to
investigate their unique spectral features. Merger remnants should produce weak
hydrogen lines and strong carbon and oxygen recombination and fine-structure
lines in the UV, optical and IR. With integral field spectrographs, we predict
that hundreds of candidates are detectable in M87 and other nearby massive
galaxies. Dust somewhat reduces the optical line emission for nebula radii

requires the encoding of single photons in high-dimensional quantum states, at
most, only one bit of secret key is distributed per sifted photon. However,
another family of protocols, namely high-dimensional (HD) QKD, enlarges the
encoding alphabet, allowing single photons to carry more than one bit of secret

of such an encoding scheme, such as larger key rates and higher noise
tolerance. Here, we devise an approach to extend the RRDPS QKD to an
arbitrarily large encoding alphabet and explore the security consequences. We
demonstrate our new framework with a proof-of-concept experiment and show that
it can adapt to various experimental conditions by optimizing the protocol

$\mathrm{morphofit}$ allows the user to fit multiple surface brightness

are typically detected at moderate/high redshift, where the volume for seeing
such rare events is maximized and the star-formation activity is greater than
at z = 0. For distant events, not all observations are feasible, such as at TeV
energies.
  Aims: Here we present a spectroscopic redshift measurement for the
exceptional GRB 221009A, the brightest GRB observed to date with emission
extending well into the TeV regime.
  Methods: We used the X-shooter spectrograph at the ESO Very Large Telescope
(VLT) to obtain simultaneous optical to near-IR spectroscopy of the burst
afterglow 0.5 days after the explosion.
  Results: The spectra exhibit both absorption and emission lines from material
in a host galaxy at z = 0.151. Thus GRB 221009A was a relatively nearby burst
with a luminosity distance of 745 Mpc. Its host galaxy properties
(star-formation rate and metallicity) are consistent with those of LGRB hosts
at low redshift. This redshift measurement yields information on the energy of
the burst. The inferred isotropic energy release, $E_{\rm iso} > 5 \times
10^{54}$ erg, lies at the high end of the distribution, making GRB 221009A one
of the nearest and also most energetic GRBs observed to date. We estimate that
such a combination (nearby as well as intrinsically bright) occurs between once
every few decades to once per millennium.

at low redshift but poorly studied at intermediate redshifts. The KR provides
information on the evolution of the population of early-type galaxies (ETGs).
Therefore, by studying it, we may shed light on the assembly processes of these
objects and their size evolution. As studies at different redshifts are
generally conducted in different rest-frame wavebands, it is important to
investigate whether the KR is dependent on wavelength. Knowledge of such a
dependence is fundamental to correctly interpreting the conclusions we might
draw from these studies. We analyse the KRs of the three Hubble Frontier Fields
clusters, Abell S1063 (z = 0.348), MACSJ0416.1-2403 (z = 0.396), and MACS
J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.542), as a function of wavelength. This is the first time
the KR of ETGs has been explored consistently over such a large range of
wavelengths at intermediate redshifts. We exploit very deep HST photometry,
ranging from the observed B-band to the H-band, and MUSE integral field
spectroscopy. We improve the structural parameter estimation we performed in a
previous work by means of a newly developed Python package called morphofit.
With its use on cluster ETGs, we find that the KR slopes increase smoothly with
wavelength from the optical to the near-infrared (NIR) bands in all three
clusters, with the intercepts becoming fainter at lower redshifts due to the
passive ageing of the ETG stellar populations. The slope trend is consistent
with previous findings at lower redshifts. The slope increase with wavelength
implies that smaller ETGs are more centrally concentrated than larger ETGs in
the NIR with respect to the optical regime. As different bands probe different
stellar populations in galaxies, the slope increase also implies that smaller
ETGs have stronger internal gradients with respect to larger ETGs.

Universe is very sensitive to $H_0$, we explored whether the present-day oldest
stars could place independent constraints on the Hubble constant. To this
purpose, we selected from the literature the oldest objects (globular clusters,
stars, white dwarfs, ultra-faint and dwarf spheroidal galaxies) with accurate
age estimates. Adopting a conservative prior on their formation redshifts ($11
\leq z_{\rm f} \leq 30$) and assuming $\Omega_{\rm M} = 0.3 \pm 0.02$, we
developed a method based on Bayesian statistics to estimate the Hubble

for each of them individually and for the average ages of homogeneous
subsamples. Statistical and systematic uncertainties were properly taken into
account. The constraints based on individual ages indicate that $H_0<70.6$

imply $H_0<73.0$ with a probability of 90.3% and errors around 2.5 km/s/Mpc. We
also constructed an ``accuracy matrix'' to assess how the constraints on $H_0$

to exterior mean motion resonances in the low eccentricity regime (up to about

branches at low eccentricity as well as low-eccentricity bridges connecting
neighboring first order resonances. With increasing perturber mass, higher
order resonances dissolve into chaos whereas low order resonances persist with
larger widths in their radial extent but smaller azimuthal widths. For low

the chaotic sea that typically occurs near mean motion resonances of

variations of up to 15% in density and entropy arise when non-ideal mixing is
accounted for. These non-ideal mixing effects must be considered in interior
models of giant planets based on accurate gravity field measurements,
particularly in the context of variations in the helium-to-hydrogen ratio. They
also affect the mass-radius relation of exoplanets. We provide a table that
contains the volume and entropy of mixing as a function of pressure and
temperature. This table is to be combined with pure hydrogen and pure helium
equations of state to obtain an equation of state that self-consistently
includes mixing effects for any hydrogen and helium mixing ratio and may be
used to model the interior structure and evolution of giant planets to brown

routinely used to detect and characterise orbiting exoplanet companions. The
different lines present in stellar spectra are created by several species,
which are non-uniformly affected by stellar variability features such as spots
or faculae. Stellar variability distorts the shape of the spectral absorption
lines from which precise RVs are measured, posing one of the main problems in
the study of exoplanets. In this work we aim to study how the spectral lines
present in M dwarfs are independently impacted by stellar activity. We used
CARMENES optical spectra of six active early- and mid-type M dwarfs to compute
line-by-line RVs and study their correlation with several well-studied proxies
of stellar activity. We are able to classify spectral lines based on their
sensitivity to activity in five M dwarfs displaying high levels of stellar
activity. We further used this line classification to compute RVs with
activity-sensitive lines and less sensitive lines, enhancing or mitigating
stellar activity effects in the RV time series. For specific sets of the least
activity-sensitive lines, the RV scatter decreases by ~ 2 to 5 times the
initial one, depending on the star. Finally, we compare these lines in the
different stars analysed, finding the sensitivity to activity to vary from star
to star. Despite the high density of lines and blends present in M dwarf
stellar spectra, we find that a line-by-line approach is able to deliver
precise RVs. Line-by-line RVs are also sensitive to stellar activity effects,
and they allow for an accurate selection of activity-insensitive lines to
mitigate activity effects in RV. However, we find stellar activity effects to
vary in the same insensitive lines from star to star.

In this work, we have revealed a rich lattice instability in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ by first-principles calculations. Beyond verifying
the $\sqrt3 \times \sqrt3 \times 3$ charge density wave (CDW) order observed by
the recent experiment, we further identified three more possible CDW
structures, i.e., $\sqrt3 \times \sqrt3 \times 2$ CDW with $P6/mmm$ symmetry,
$2 \times 2 \times 2$ CDW with $Immm$ symmetry, and $2 \times 2 \times 2$ CDW
with $P6/mmm$ symmetry. The former two are more energetically favored than the
$\sqrt3 \times \sqrt3 \times 3$ phase, while the third one is comparable in
energy. These CDW distortions involve mainly out-of-plane motions of Sc and Sn
atoms, while V atoms constituting the kagome net are almost unchanged. We
attribute the lattice instability to the smallness of Sc atomic radius. In
contrast, such an instability disappears in its sister compounds $R$V$_6$Sn$_6$
($R$ is Y, or a rare-earth element) because $R$ has a larger radius. Our work
indicates that ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ might exhibit varied CDW phases in different

strengths, up to $B\simeq 4\times10^{18}$ G, employing the latest experimental
nuclear masses supplemented with various mass models. The essential effects of
the magnetic field are twoholds: 1) Enhancement of electron fraction, which is
connected to that of protons via the charge neutrality condition, due to the
Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion perpendicular to the field, namely,
neutron-richness is suppressed for a given pressure. As a result, 2) nuclei can
exist at higher pressures without dripping out neutrons. By exploring optimal
outer-crust compositions from all possible nuclei predicted by theoretical
models, we find that neutron-rich heavy nuclei with neutron magic numbers 50,
82, 126, as well as 184, with various proton numbers emerge for $B\gtrsim
10^{17}$ G. Moreover, we show that superheavy nuclei with proton numbers
$Z\ge104$, including unknown elements such as $Z=119, 120, 122$, and/or $124$,
depending on mass models, may emerge as an equilibrium composition at bottom
layers of the outer crust for $B\gtrsim 10^{18}$ G, which are extremely
neutron-rich ($N\approx 260$-$287$, i.e., $N/Z\approx 2.2$-$2.4$). We point out
that those extremely neutron-rich superheavy nuclei locate around the next
neutron magic number $N=258$ after $N=184$, underlining importance of nuclear
structure calculations under such really exotic, extreme conditions. We
demonstrate how the superstrong magnetic field substantially alters crustal

FURST has the potential to observe UV absorption while imaging solar spectra
between 120-181 nm, at a resolution of R > 2x10$^4$ ($\Delta$ V < $\pm$ 15
km/s), and at altitudes of between 110-255 km. This model uses estimates for
density and temperature, as well as laboratory measurements of the absorption
cross-section, to predict the UV absorption of solar radiation at high
altitudes. Refraction correction is discussed and partially implemented but is
negligible for the results presented. Absorption by molecular Oxygen is the
primary driver within the UV spectral range of our interest. The model is built
with a wide range of applications in mind. The primary result is a method for
inversion of the absorption cross-section from images obtained during an
instrument flight, even if atmospheric observations were not initially
intended. The potential to obtain measurements of atmospheric properties is an
exciting prospect, especially since sounding rockets are the only method
currently available for probing this altitude in situ. Simulation of noisy
spectral images along the FURST flight profile is performed using data from the
High-Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph (HRTS) SR and the FISM2 model for
comparison. Analysis of these simulated signals allows us to capture the
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of FURST and the capability to measure atmospheric
absorption properties as a function of altitude. Based on the prevalence of
distinct spectral features, our calculations demonstrate that atmospheric
absorption may be used to perform wavelength calibration from in-flight data.

Challenge (CEC2), which consists of target speech enhancement for hearing-aid
(HA) devices in noisy-reverberant environments with multiple interferers such
as music and competing speakers.
  Our approach builds upon the powerful iterative neural/beamforming
enhancement (iNeuBe) framework introduced in our recent work, and this paper
extends it for target speaker extraction. We therefore name the proposed
approach as iNeuBe-X, where the X stands for extraction. To address the
challenges encountered in the CEC2 setting, we introduce four major novelties:
  (1) we extend the state-of-the-art TF-GridNet model, originally designed for
monaural speaker separation, for multi-channel, causal speech enhancement, and
large improvements are observed by replacing the TCNDenseNet used in iNeuBe
with this new architecture;
  (2) we leverage a recent dual window size approach with future-frame
prediction to ensure that iNueBe-X satisfies the 5 ms constraint on algorithmic
latency required by CEC2;
  (3) we introduce a novel speaker-conditioning branch for TF-GridNet to
achieve target speaker extraction;
  (4) we propose a fine-tuning step, where we compute an additional loss with
respect to the target speaker signal compensated with the listener audiogram.
  Without using external data, on the official development set our best model
reaches a hearing-aid speech perception index (HASPI) score of 0.942 and a
scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SI-SDRi) of 18.8 dB.
These results are promising given the fact that the CEC2 data is extremely
challenging (e.g., on the development set the mixture SI-SDR is -12.3 dB). A
demo of our submitted system is available at WAVLab CEC2 demo.

irregular (dIrr) galaxies within the field of view of the HAWC Observatory.
dIrr galaxies are DM dominated objects, which astrophysical gamma-ray emission
is estimated to be negligible with respect to the secondary gamma-ray flux
expected by annihilation or decay of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles
(WIMPs). While we do not see any statistically significant DM signal in dIrr
galaxies, we present the exclusion limits ($95\%~\text{C.L.}$) for annihilation
cross-section and decay lifetime for WIMP candidates with masses between $1$
and $100~\text{TeV}$. Exclusion limits from dIrr galaxies are relevant and
complementary to benchmark dwarf Spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. In fact, dIrr
galaxies are targets kinematically different from benchmark dSph, preserving
the footprints of different evolution histories. We compare the limits from
dIrr galaxies to those from ultrafaint and classical dSph galaxies previously
observed with HAWC. We find that the contraints are comparable to the limits
from classical dSph galaxies and $\thicksim2$ orders of magnitude weaker than
the ultrafaint dSph limits.

complementary types of data or views (e.g. genomics, proteomics, metabolomics)
and opened up a new era in multiview learning research with the potential to
lead to new biomedical discoveries. We propose iDeepViewLearn (Interpretable
Deep Learning Method for Multiview Learning) for learning nonlinear
relationships in data from multiple views while achieving feature selection.
iDeepViewLearn combines deep learning flexibility with the statistical benefits
of data and knowledge-driven feature selection, giving interpretable results.
Deep neural networks are used to learn view-independent low-dimensional
embedding through an optimization problem that minimizes the difference between
observed and reconstructed data, while imposing a regularization penalty on the
reconstructed data. The normalized Laplacian of a graph is used to model
bilateral relationships between variables in each view, therefore, encouraging
selection of related variables. iDeepViewLearn is tested on simulated and two
real-world data, including breast cancer-related gene expression and
methylation data. iDeepViewLearn had competitive classification results and
identified genes and CpG sites that differentiated between individuals who died
from breast cancer and those who did not. The results of our real data
application and simulations with small to moderate sample sizes suggest that
iDeepViewLearn may be a useful method for small-sample-size problems compared
to other deep learning methods for multiview learning.

well as the beta exponent from the Heitler-Matthews model which governs the
number of muons found in an extensive air shower as a function of the mass and
the energy of the primary cosmic ray. This method uses the so-called z variable
(difference between the total reconstructed and the simulated signals), which
is connected to the muon signal and is roughly independent of the zenith angle,
but depends on the mass of the primary cosmic ray. Using a mock dataset built
from QGSJetII-04, we show that such a method allows us to reproduce the average
muon signal from this dataset using Monte-Carlo events generated with the
EPOS-LHC hadronic model, with accuracy better than 6%. As a consequence of the
good recovery of the muon signal for each primary included in the analysis,
also the beta exponent can be obtained with accuracy of less than 1% for the

in obstacle locations by trying to restrict the robot from operating in any
possible location that an obstacle could be in. Unfortunately, this can result
in overly conservative behavior. Chance-constrained optimization can be applied
to improve the performance of motion planning algorithms by allowing for a
user-specified amount of bounded constraint violation. However,
state-of-the-art methods rely either on moment-based inequalities, which can be
overly conservative, or make it difficult to satisfy assumptions about the
class of probability distributions used to model uncertainty. To address these
challenges, this work proposes a real-time, risk-aware reachability-based
motion planning framework called RADIUS. The method first generates a reachable
set of parameterized trajectories for the robot offline. At run time, RADIUS
computes a closed-form over-approximation of the risk of a collision with an
obstacle. This is done without restricting the probability distribution used to
model uncertainty to a simple class (e.g., Gaussian). Then, RADIUS performs
real-time optimization to construct a trajectory that can be followed by the
robot in a manner that is certified to have a risk of collision that is less
than or equal to a user-specified threshold. The proposed algorithm is compared
to several state-of-the-art chance-constrained and deterministic methods in

$\Lambda$CDM even in the absence of a SH0ES prior on $H_0$. While this is
stronger evidence for NEDE than obtained with the corresponding Bayesian

$f_\mathrm{NEDE}=0.136^{+0.024}_{-0.026}$ at $68 \%$ CL. Furthermore, we
compare NEDE with the Early Dark Energy (EDE) model, finding similar

large-scale motions of the cluster medium using cluster hydrodynamic
cosmological simulations. To utilise the rotational kSZ as a cosmological
probe, simulations offer some of the most comprehensive data sets that can
inform the modeling of this signal. In this work, we use the MACSIS data set to
specifically investigate the rotational kSZ effect in massive clusters. Based
on these models, we test stacking approaches and estimate the amplitude of the
combined signal with varying mass, dynamical state, redshift and map-alignment
geometry. We find that the dark matter, galaxy and gas spins are generally
misaligned, an effect that can cause a sub-optimal estimation of the rotational
kSZ effect when based on galaxy catalogues. Furthermore, we provide
halo-spin-mass scaling relations that can be used to build a statistical model
of the rotational kSZ. The rotational kSZ contribution, which is largest in
massive unrelaxed clusters ($\gtrsim$100 $\mu$K), could be relevant to studies
of higher-order CMB temperature signals, such as the moving lens effect. The
limited mass range of the MACSIS sample strongly motivates an extended
investigation of the rotational kSZ effect in large-volume simulations to
refine the modelling, particularly towards lower mass and higher redshift, and
provide forecasts for upcoming cosmological CMB experiments (e.g. Simons

environments are often equipped with several end-effector tools that can be
swapped on-the-fly, based on the target object. Tool-change, however, takes
time. Choosing the order of grasps to perform, and corresponding tool-change
actions, can improve system throughput; this is the topic of our work. The main
challenge in planning tool change is uncertainty - we typically cannot see
objects in the bin that are currently occluded. Inspired by queuing and
admission control problems, we model the problem as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP), where the goal is to maximize expected throughput, and we pursue an
approximate solution based on model predictive control, where at each time step
we plan based only on the currently visible objects. Special to our method is
the idea of void zones, which are geometrical boundaries in which an unknown
object will be present, and therefore cannot be accounted for during planning.
Our planning problem can be solved using integer linear programming (ILP).
However, we find that an approximate solution based on sparse tree search
yields near optimal performance at a fraction of the time. Another question
that we explore is how to measure the performance of tool-change planning: we
find that throughput alone can fail to capture delicate and smooth behavior,
and propose a principled alternative. Finally, we demonstrate our algorithms on
both synthetic and real world bin picking tasks.

occurs in two-dimensional axisymmetric systems. First, a cylindrical moment
model is obtained by starting from the cylindrical incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations. We derive two-dimensional axisymmetric Shallow Water Moment
Equations by imposing axisymmetry in the cylindrical model. The loss of
hyperbolicity is observed by directly evaluating the propagation speeds and
plotting the hyperbolicity region. A hyperbolic axisymmetric moment model is
then obtained by modifying the system matrix in analogy to the one-dimensional
case, for which the hyperbolicity problem has already been observed and
overcome. The new model is written in analytical form and we prove that
hyperbolicity can be guaranteed. To test the new model, numerical simulations
with both discontinuous and continuous initial data are performed. We show that
the hyperbolic model leads to less oscillations than the non-hyperbolic model
in the case of a discontinuous initial height profile. The hyperbolic model is
preferred over the non-hyperbolic model in this specific scenario for shorter
times. Further, we observe that the error decreases when the order of the model
is increased in a test case with smooth initial data.

of four Celestron RASA 11 telescopes that point to the same sky field, equipped
with QHY600PRO CMOS cameras on an equatorial Direct Drive mount. Each module is
equivalent to a 56cm effective diameter telescope and provides a 7.3 deg^2
field of view and a 1.26 arcsec/pix plate scale. ATLAS-Teide will consist of
four ATLAS modules in a roll-off roof building. This configuration allows to
cover the same sky area of the actual ATLAS telescopes.
  The first ATLAS module was installed in November 2022 in an existing
clamshell at the TO. This module (ATLAS-P) is being used as a prototype to test
the system capabilities, develop the needed software (control, image

empirically estimate the privacy level of an algorithm. For private machine
learning, existing auditing mechanisms are tight: the empirical privacy
estimate (nearly) matches the algorithm's provable privacy guarantee. But these
auditing techniques suffer from two limitations. First, they only give tight
estimates under implausible worst-case assumptions (e.g., a fully adversarial
dataset). Second, they require thousands or millions of training runs to
produce non-trivial statistical estimates of the privacy leakage.
  This work addresses both issues. We design an improved auditing scheme that
yields tight privacy estimates for natural (not adversarially crafted) datasets
-- if the adversary can see all model updates during training. Prior auditing
works rely on the same assumption, which is permitted under the standard
differential privacy threat model. This threat model is also applicable, e.g.,
in federated learning settings. Moreover, our auditing scheme requires only two
training runs (instead of thousands) to produce tight privacy estimates, by
adapting recent advances in tight composition theorems for differential
privacy. We demonstrate the utility of our improved auditing schemes by
surfacing implementation bugs in private machine learning code that eluded
prior auditing techniques.

neurodevelopmental disorders in children and is characterised by inattention,

functional connectivity in the resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) of ADHD
patients, detailed investigations are required to characterize the connectivity
dynamics in the brain. In an attempt to establish a link between attention
instability and the dynamic properties of Functional Connectivity (FC), we
investigated the differences in temporal variability of FC between 40 children
with ADHD and 40 Typically Developing (TD) children. Using a sliding-window
method to segment the rs-fMRI scans in time, we employed seed-to-voxel
correlation analysis for each window to obtain time-evolving seed connectivity
maps for seeds placed in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For each subject, the standard deviation of the voxel
connectivity time series was used as a measure of the temporal variability of
FC. Results showed that ADHD patients exhibited significantly higher
variability in dFC than TD children in the cingulo-temporal, cingulo-parietal,
fronto-temporal, and fronto-parietal networks ($p_{FWE} < 0.05$). Atypical
temporal variability was observed in the left and right temporal gyri, the
anterior cingulate cortex, and lateral regions of the right parietal cortex.
The observations are consistent with visual attention issues, executive control
deficit, and rightward parietal dysfunction reported in ADHD, respectively.
These results help in understanding the disorder with a fresh perspective

moreover can signal a change point from arbitrarily small perturbations, which
leads to a high rate of false alarms in CPD. Additionally, under mild

Startups are a vital source of social, scientific and economic innovation, yet
the most innovative are also the least likely to survive. The probability of
success of startups has been shown to relate to several firm-level factors such
as industry, location and the economy of the day. Still, attention has
increasingly considered internal factors relating to the firm's founding team,
including their previous experiences and failures, their centrality in a global
network of other founders and investors as well as the team's size. The effects
of founders' personalities on the success of new ventures are mainly unknown.
Here we show that founder personality traits are a significant feature of a
firm's ultimate success. We draw upon detailed data about the success of a
large-scale global sample of startups. We found that the Big 5 personality
traits of startup founders across 30 dimensions significantly differed from
that of the population at large. Key personality facets that distinguish
successful entrepreneurs include a preference for variety, novelty and starting
new things (openness to adventure), like being the centre of attention (lower
levels of modesty) and being exuberant (higher activity levels). However, we do
not find one ""Founder-type"" personality; instead, six different personality
types appear, with startups founded by a ""Hipster, Hacker and Hustler"" being
twice as likely to succeed. Our results also demonstrate the benefits of
larger, personality-diverse teams in startups, which has the potential to be

21 cm line during the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) need to achieve an
unprecedented dynamic range to separate the weak signal from overwhelming
foreground emissions. Calibration inaccuracies can compromise the sensitivity
of these measurements to the effect that a detection of the EoR is precluded.
An alternative to standard analysis techniques makes use of the closure phase,
which allows one to bypass antenna-based direction-independent calibration.
Similarly to standard approaches, we use a delay spectrum technique to search
for the EoR signal. Using 94 nights of data observed with Phase I of the
Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), we place approximate constraints
on the 21 cm power spectrum at $z=7.7$. We find at 95% confidence that the 21
cm EoR brightness temperature is $\le$(372)$^2$ ""pseudo"" mK$^2$ at 1.14
""pseudo"" $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, where the ""pseudo"" emphasises that these limits are to
be interpreted as approximations to the actual distance scales and brightness
temperatures. Using a fiducial EoR model, we demonstrate the feasibility of
detecting the EoR with the full array. Compared to standard methods, the
closure phase processing is relatively simple, thereby providing an important

prove that the image map is globally of class $W^{3,BMO}$, and locally of class

range of linear inverse problems arising in signal and image processing. The
classic instance of this is the famous Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm
(ISTA), based on soft-thresholding of wavelet coefficients. More modern
approaches to IDAs replace soft-thresholding with a black-box denoiser, such as
BM3D or a learned deep neural network denoiser. These are often referred to as
``plug-and-play"" (PnP) methods because, in principle, an off-the-shelf denoiser
can be used for a variety of different inverse problems. The problem with PnP
methods is that they may not provide the best solutions to a specific linear
inverse problem; better solutions can often be obtained by a denoiser that is
customized to the problem domain. A problem-specific denoiser, however,
requires expensive re-engineering or re-learning which eliminates the

unbiasedly estimate the average regional-exposure effect (ARE). This results in
a plug-in estimator with an asymptotically normal distribution and minimum

CVtreeMLE enables researchers to discover interpretable exposure regions in

frequent lack of structural data. Inspired by the recently-emerging field of
population-based structural health monitoring (PBSHM), and the use of transfer
learning in this novel field, the current work attempts to create models that
are able to transfer knowledge within populations of structures. The approach
followed here is meta-learning, which is developed with a view to creating
neural network models which are able to exploit knowledge from a population of
various tasks to perform well in newly-presented tasks, with minimal training
and a small number of data samples from the new task. Essentially, the method
attempts to perform transfer learning in an automatic manner within the
population of tasks. For the purposes of population-based structural modelling,
the different tasks refer to different structures. The method is applied here
to a population of simulated structures with a view to predicting their
responses as a function of some environmental parameters. The meta-learning
approach, which is used herein is the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML)
approach; it is compared to a traditional data-driven modelling approach, that
of Gaussian processes, which is a quite effective alternative when few data
samples are available for a problem. It is observed that the models trained
using meta-learning approaches, are able to outperform conventional machine
learning methods regarding inference about structures of the population, for
which only a small number of samples are available. Moreover, the models prove
to learn part of the physics of the problem, making them more robust than plain

stochastic residuals between grid points. Here, we aim to improve the
simulation of stochastic forcing with generative models of ML, such as
Generative adversarial network (GAN) and Variational autoencoder (VAE).
Generative models learn the distribution of subgrid forcing conditioned on the
resolved flow directly from data and they can produce new samples from this
distribution. Generative models can potentially capture not only the spatial
correlation but any statistically significant property of subgrid forcing. We
test the proposed stochastic parameterizations offline and online in an

simultaneously maximizes a surrogate objective and enforces a trust region
constraint over consecutive policies in each iteration. The combination of the
surrogate objective maximization and the trust region enforcement has been
shown to be crucial to guarantee a monotonic policy improvement. However,
solving a trust-region-constrained optimization problem can be computationally
intensive as it requires many steps of conjugate gradient and a large number of
on-policy samples. In this paper, we show that the trust region constraint over
policies can be safely substituted by a trust-region-free constraint without
compromising the underlying monotonic improvement guarantee. The key idea is to
generalize the surrogate objective used in TRPO in a way that a monotonic
improvement guarantee still emerges as a result of constraining the maximum
advantage-weighted ratio between policies. This new constraint outlines a
conservative mechanism for iterative policy optimization and sheds light on
practical ways to optimize the generalized surrogate objective. We show that
the new constraint can be effectively enforced by being conservative when
optimizing the generalized objective function in practice. We call the
resulting algorithm Trust-REgion-Free Policy Optimization (TREFree) as it is
free of any explicit trust region constraints. Empirical results show that
TREFree outperforms TRPO and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in terms of

structural dynamics. Detecting nonlinearity in a structure, which has been
designed to operate in its linear region, might indicate the existence of
damage. Therefore, it is important, even for safety reasons, to detect when a
structure exhibits nonlinear behaviour. In the current work, a method to detect
nonlinearity is proposed, based on the distribution of the gradients of a
data-driven model, which is fitted on data acquired from the structure of
interest. The data-driven model herein is a neural network. The selection of
such a type of model was done in order to not allow the user to decide how
linear or nonlinear the model shall be, but to let the training algorithm of
the neural network shape the level of nonlinearity according to the training
data. The neural network is trained to predict the accelerations of the
structure for a time-instant using as inputs accelerations of previous
time-instants, i.e. one-step-ahead predictions. Afterwards, the gradients of
the output of the neural network with respect to its inputs are calculated.
Given that the structure is linear, the distribution of the aforementioned
gradients should be quite peaked, while in the case of a structure with
nonlinearities, the distribution of the gradients shall be more spread and,
potentially, multimodal. To test the above assumption, data from an
experimental structure are considered. The structure is tested under different
scenarios, some of which are linear and some nonlinear. The statistics of the
distributions of the gradients for the different scenarios can be used to
identify cases where nonlinearity is present. Moreover, via the proposed method
one is able to quantify the nonlinearity by observing higher values of standard
deviation of the distribution of the gradients for ""more nonlinear"" scenarios.

  Prompting","13 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce \`A-la-carte Prompt Tuning (APT), a transformer-based scheme to
tune prompts on distinct data so that they can be arbitrarily composed at
inference time. The individual prompts can be trained in isolation, possibly on
different devices, at different times, and on different distributions or
domains. Furthermore each prompt only contains information about the subset of
data it was exposed to during training. During inference, models can be
assembled based on arbitrary selections of data sources, which we call
""\`a-la-carte learning"". \`A-la-carte learning enables constructing bespoke
models specific to each user's individual access rights and preferences. We can
add or remove information from the model by simply adding or removing the
corresponding prompts without retraining from scratch. We demonstrate that
\`a-la-carte built models achieve accuracy within $5\%$ of models trained on
the union of the respective sources, with comparable cost in terms of training
and inference time. For the continual learning benchmarks Split CIFAR-100 and
CORe50, we achieve state-of-the-art performance.

the slowest operator, that plays a key role at the final period of
thermalization. We introduce two independent definitions of the slowest
operator: local and translationally-invariant ones. We construct both operators
numerically using tensor networks and extensively compare their physical
properties. We find that the local operator has a significant overlap with
energy flux, it does not correspond to an integral of motion, and, as one goes
away from the integrable point, its revivals get suppressed and the rate of
delocalization changes from extremely slow to slower than diffusion. The
translationally-invariant operator corresponds to an integral of motion; as the
system becomes less integrable, at some point this operator changes its nature:
from no overlap with any magnetization and fast rate of delocalization, to
non-zero overlap with magnetizations $\sigma_{x}$ and $\sigma_{z}$ and slow
rate of delocalization.

Wearable devices, particularly IMU sensors, can help us collect rich features

researchers. One major problem is that there is usually a deficit of training
data for some activities, making it difficult and sometimes impossible to
develop a classifier. In this work, a novel GAN network called TheraGAN was
developed to generate realistic IMU signals associated with a particular
activity. The generated signal is of a 6-channel IMU. i.e., angular velocities
and linear accelerations. Also, by introducing simple activities, which are
meaningful subparts of a complex full-length activity, the generation process
was facilitated for any activity with arbitrary length. To evaluate the
generated signals, besides perceptual similarity metrics, they were applied
along with real data to improve the accuracy of classifiers. The results show
that the maximum increase in the f1-score belongs to the LSTM classifier by a
13.27% rise when generated data were added. This shows the validity of the
generated data as well as TheraGAN as a tool to build more robust classifiers

defense for mitigating BGP hijacking attacks against certificate authorities.
While the adoption of multiVA is on the rise, little work has quantified its
effectiveness against BGP hijacks in the wild. We bridge the gap by presenting
the first analysis framework that measures the security of a multiVA deployment
under real-world network configurations (e.g., DNS and RPKI). Our framework
accurately models the attack surface of multiVA by 1) considering the attacks
on DNS nameservers involved in domain validation, 2) considering deployed
practical security techniques such as RPKI, 3) performing fine-grained
internet-scale analysis to compute multiVA resilience (i.e., how difficult it
is to launch a BGP hijack against a domain and get a bogus certificate under
multiVA). We use our framework to perform a rigorous security analysis of the
multiVA deployment of Let's Encrypt, using a dataset that consists of about 1
million certificates and 31 billion DNS queries collected over four months. Our
analysis shows while DNS does enlarge the attack surface of multiVA, the of
Let's Encrypt's multiVA deployment still offers an 88% median resilience
against BGP hijacks, a notable improvement over 76% offered by
single-vantage-point validation. RPKI, even in its current state of partial
deployment, effectively mitigates BGP attacks and improves the security of the
deployment by 15% as compared to the case without considering RPKI. Exploring
11,000 different multiVA configurations, we find that Let's Encrypt's
deployment can be further enhanced to achieve a resilience of over 99% by using
a full quorum policy with only two additional vantage points in different

captures coordination among agents and enjoys good algorithmic properties. In
real-world multi-agent systems, in addition to being in an equilibrium, agents'
policies are often expected to meet requirements with respect to safety, and
fairness. Such additional requirements can often be expressed in terms of the
state density which measures the state-visitation frequencies during the course
of a game. However, existing CE notions or CE-finding approaches cannot
explicitly specify a CE with particular properties concerning state density;
they do so implicitly by either modifying reward functions or using value
functions as the selection criteria. The resulting CE may thus not fully fulfil
the state-density requirements. In this paper, we propose Density-Based
Correlated Equilibria (DBCE), a new notion of CE that explicitly takes state
density as selection criterion. Concretely, we instantiate DBCE by specifying
different state-density requirements motivated by real-world applications. To
compute DBCE, we put forward the Density Based Correlated Policy Iteration
algorithm for the underlying control problem. We perform experiments on various
games where results demonstrate the advantage of our CE-finding approach over

(DL) models, which makes training efficiency crucial. Common practice is
struggling with the trade-off between usability and performance. On one hand,
DL frameworks such as PyTorch use dynamic graphs to facilitate model developers
at a price of sub-optimal model training performance. On the other hand,
practitioners propose various approaches to improving the training efficiency
by sacrificing some of the flexibility, ranging from making the graph static
for more thorough optimization (e.g., XLA) to customizing optimization towards
large-scale distributed training (e.g., DeepSpeed and Megatron-LM).
  In this paper, we aim to address the tension between usability and training
efficiency through separation of concerns. Inspired by DL compilers that
decouple the platform-specific optimizations of a tensor-level operator from
its arithmetic definition, this paper proposes a schedule language to decouple
model execution from definition. Specifically, the schedule works on a PyTorch
model and uses a set of schedule primitives to convert the model for common
model training optimizations such as high-performance kernels, effective 3D
parallelism, and efficient activation checkpointing. Compared to existing
optimization solutions, we optimize the model as-needed through high-level
primitives, and thus preserving programmability and debuggability for users to
a large extent. Our evaluation results show that by scheduling the existing
hand-crafted optimizations in a systematic way, we are able to improve training
throughput by up to 3.35x on a single machine with 8 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, and by

and (2) extending the sample size of known RV of PNe in order to understand
their kinematics and the dynamics of the Milky Way. As a target sample, we used

game between the buyers. A key component of this model is the negative
externality buyers induce on one another due to purchasing data with a
competitive advantage, a phenomenon exacerbated by data's easy replicability.
We consider two settings. In the simpler complete-information setting, where
all buyers know their valuations, we characterize both the existence and
welfare properties of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in the presence of
buyer externality. While this picture is bleak without any market intervention,
reinforcing the limitations of current data markets, we prove that for a
standard class of externality functions, market intervention in the form of a
transaction cost can lead to a pure-strategy equilibrium with strong welfare
guarantees. We next consider a more general setting where buyers start with
unknown valuations and learn them over time through repeated data purchases.
Our intervention is feasible in this regime as well, and we provide a learning
algorithm for buyers in this online scenario that under some natural
assumptions, achieves low regret with respect to both individual and cumulative
utility metrics. Lastly, we analyze the promise and shortfalls of this
intervention under a much richer model of externality. Our work paves the way

fluids with viscoelastic properties. We show that a number of previous studies

correctly reformulate the problem and solve the governing equations using a
Chebyshev collocation scheme. By analysing the decay of the solutions to the
far-field we determine the correct stress boundary conditions required to solve
problems of this form.
  Our results show that both the fluid velocity within the boundary layer and
the stress at the solid boundary increase due to the effect of viscoelasticity.
As a consequence of this, we predict a thinning of the boundary layer as the
value of the dimensionless viscoelastic flow parameter is increased. These
results contradict a number of prominent studies in the literature but are
supported by results owing from an asymptotic analysis based on the assumption
of the smallness of the non-dimensional viscoelastic flow parameter.

individual fairness in learning with censorship where the assumption of

velocity and normal stress coupled together, which brings great challenges to
some commonly used numerical methods to obtain accurate solutions. To overcome
the difficulties, a kernel free boundary integral (KFBI) method combined with a
modified marker-and-cell (MAC) scheme is developed to solve the two-phase

the two-phase Stokes problem into a single-fluid Stokes problem by using
boundary integral equations and then evaluate the boundary integrals indirectly
through a Cartesian grid-based method. Since the jump conditions of the
single-fluid Stokes problems can be easily decoupled, the modified MAC scheme
is adopted here and the existing fast solver can be applicable for the
resulting linear saddle system. The computed numerical solutions are second
order accurate in discrete $\ell^2$-norm for velocity and pressure as well as
the gradient of velocity, and also second order accurate in maximum norm for
both velocity and its gradient, even in the case of high contrast viscosity
coefficient, which is demonstrated in numerical tests.

proposed cyclic walks between perceptual features extracted from CNN or
transformers and object entities. First, a slot-attention module interfaces
with these perceptual features and produces a finite set of slot
representations. These slots can bind to any object entities in the scene via
inter-slot competitions for attention. Next, we establish entity-feature
correspondence with cyclic walks along high transition probability based on
pairwise similarity between perceptual features (aka ""parts"") and slot-binded
object representations (aka ""whole""). The whole is greater than its parts and
the parts constitute the whole. The part-whole interactions form cycle
consistencies, as supervisory signals, to train the slot-attention module. We
empirically demonstrate that the networks trained with our cyclic walks can
extract object-centric representations on seven image datasets in three
unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to object-centric models attached with
a decoder for image or feature reconstructions, our cyclic walks provide strong
supervision signals, avoiding computation overheads and enhancing memory

paper introduces the concept of Fourier-Averaged Navier-Stokes (FANS) equations

identifying terms contributing to momentum transport at different timescales.
The method also allows for direct interpretation of non-linear interactions of
the terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. By analysing well-known cases, the
characteristics of FANS are evaluated. Particularly, we focus on physical
interpretation of the terms as they relate to the interactions between modes at
different timescales. Through comparison with established physics and other
methods, FANS is shown to provide insight into the transfer of momentum between
modes by extracting information about the contributing pressure, convective,

set of equations to analyse flow physics by leveraging momentum conservation
principles and Fourier analysis. The method is applicable to flows with complex

produce accurate solutions and numerical convergence can be demonstrated using
a resolution study, the rigorous convergence proofs are usually limited to
particular reformulations and boundary conditions. In this paper, a rigorous
error analysis of the marker and cell (MAC) scheme for Stokes interface
problems with constant viscosity in the framework of the finite difference
method is presented. Without reformulating the problem into elliptic PDEs, the
main idea is to use a discrete Ladyzenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition and
construct auxiliary functions, which satisfy discretized Stokes equations and
possess at least second order accuracy in the neighborhood of the moving
interface. In particular, the method, for the first time, enables one to prove
second order convergence of the velocity gradient in the discrete
$\ell^2$-norm, in addition to the velocity and pressure fields. Numerical
experiments verify the desired properties of the methods and the expected order
of accuracy for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples.

differential equations. Typically, the right-hand side of the differential
equation is split into a number of parts that can then be integrated
separately. Many methods are known that split the right-hand side into two

3-splitting is more natural and ultimately more advantageous. The second-order
Strang operator-splitting method readily generalizes to a right-hand side
splitting into any number of operators. It is arguably the most popular method
for 3-splitting because of its efficiency, ease of implementation, and
intuitive nature. Other 3-splitting methods exist, but they are less
well-known, and evaluations of their performance in practice are scarce. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of some alternative 3-split, second-order methods
to Strang splitting on two problems: the reaction-diffusion Brusselator, which
can be split into three parts that each have closed-form solutions, and the
kinetic Vlasov--Poisson equations that is used in semi-Lagrangian plasma
simulations. We find alternative second-order 3-operator-splitting methods that
realize efficiency gains of 10\%--20\% over traditional Strang splitting.

using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in this work. In particular, to
better capture the sharpness of the solution, we propose adaptive sampling
methods (ASMs) based on the residual and the gradient of the solution. We first
present a residual only based ASM algorithm denoted by ASM I. In this approach,
we first train the neural network by using a small number of residual points
and divide the computational domain into a certain number of sub-domains, we
then add new residual points in the sub-domain which has the largest mean
absolute value of the residual, and those points which have largest absolute
values of the residual in this sub-domain will be added as new residual points.
We further develop a second type of ASM algorithm (denoted by ASM II) based on
both the residual and the gradient of the solution due to the fact that only
the residual may be not able to efficiently capture the sharpness of the
solution. The procedure of ASM II is almost the same as that of ASM I except
that in ASM II, we add new residual points which not only have large residual
but also large gradient. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the present
methods, we employ both ASM I and ASM II to solve a number of PDEs, including
Burger equation, compressible Euler equation, Poisson equation over an L-shape
domain as well as high-dimensional Poisson equation. It has been shown from the
numerical results that the sharp solutions can be well approximated by using
either ASM I or ASM II algorithm, and both methods deliver much more accurate
solution than original PINNs with the same number of residual points. Moreover,
the ASM II algorithm has better performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency
and stability compared with the ASM I algorithm.

investigated experimentally and numerically. The baseline deterrent, a
single-whistle design inspired by Beeken [1], is examined first. It consists of
two resonating cavities/chambers. The whistle is ``powered'' by a regulated
high-pressure air supply and the performance of the whistle is examined for a
range of supply pressures. Farfield acoustic measurements in the $20$ Hz - $50$
kHz frequency range are made in an anechoic chamber. The noise measurements are
supplemented with two- and three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes (uRANS) simulations to investigate the mechanisms of ultrasound
generation. The Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings acoustic analogy is used with the 3-D
uRANS results to predict the far field radiation. The farfield acoustic
predictions are in good agreement with the measurements in the anechoic
chamber. The peak frequency (fundamental) of the radiated ultrasound of the
baseline deterrent is approximately $23$ kHz. Harmonics and a sub-harmonic of
the fundamental tone are also observed. The numerical simulations show that the
two resonating chambers of the baseline deterrent operate out-of-phase and
Helmholtz resonance determines the whistling frequency over the range of supply
air pressure considered.
  A six-whistle deterrent targeting a broad spectral coverage in the $20-50$
kHz frequency range is designed, fabricated and tested in the anechoic chamber.
Each whistle in the deterrent is obtained by geometrically scaling the baseline
whistle. Measurements show that the six-whistle ultrasound deterrent generates
ultrasound with six dominant peaks in the designed frequency range when the
supply air pressure exceeds $5$ psig. The proposed ultrasound devices can serve
as effective bat deterrents for a variety of purposes including reducing bat
mortality at wind turbines.

robots. Specifically, to alleviate the online computational complexity of
nonlinear MPC, this paper devises a lattice piecewise affine (PWA)
approximation method that can approximate both the nonlinear system and control
law of explicit nonlinear MPC. The kinematic model of the mobile robot is
successively linearized along the trajectory to obtain a linear time-varying
description of the system, which is then expressed using a lattice PWA model.
Subsequently, the nonlinear MPC problem can be transformed into a series of
linear MPC problems. Furthermore, to reduce the complexity of online
calculation of multiple linear MPC problems, we approximate the optimal
solution of the linear MPC by using the lattice PWA model. That is, for
different sampling states, the optimal control inputs are obtained, and lattice
PWA approximations are constructed for the state control pairs. Simulations are
performed to evaluate the performance of our method in comparison with the

Nevertheless, recent studies have illustrated that FL still suffers from
information leakage as adversaries try to recover the training data by
analyzing shared parameters from local clients. To deal with this issue,
differential privacy (DP) is adopted to add noise to the gradients of local

unnormalized densities by leveraging the momentum of a particle moving in a

questions: (1) Can we obtain improved sampling guarantees beyond strong
log-concavity? (2) Can we achieve acceleration for sampling?
  For (1), prior results for ULMC only hold under a log-Sobolev inequality
together with a restrictive Hessian smoothness condition. Here, we relax these
assumptions by removing the Hessian smoothness condition and by considering
distributions satisfying a Poincar\'e inequality. Our analysis achieves the
state of art dimension dependence, and is also flexible enough to handle weakly
smooth potentials. As a byproduct, we also obtain the first KL divergence
guarantees for ULMC without Hessian smoothness under strong log-concavity,
which is based on a new result on the log-Sobolev constant along the
underdamped Langevin diffusion.
  For (2), the recent breakthrough of Cao, Lu, and Wang (2020) established the
first accelerated result for sampling in continuous time via PDE methods. Our
discretization analysis translates their result into an algorithmic guarantee,
which indeed enjoys better condition number dependence than prior works on
ULMC, although we leave open the question of full acceleration in discrete
time.
  Both (1) and (2) necessitate R\'enyi discretization bounds, which are more
challenging than the typically used Wasserstein coupling arguments. We address

and instances that are not labeled as positive are considered negative samples.
However, manual cell annotation is complicated due to the large number and
diversity of cells, and it can be difficult to ensure the annotation of every
positive instance. In many cases, only incomplete annotations are available,
where some of the positive instances are annotated and the others are not, and
the classification loss term for negative samples in typical network training
becomes incorrect. In this work, to address this problem of incomplete
annotations, we propose to reformulate the training of the detection network as
a positive-unlabeled learning problem. Since the instances in unannotated
regions can be either positive or negative, they have unknown labels. Using the
samples with unknown labels and the positively labeled samples, we first derive
an approximation of the classification loss term corresponding to negative

extend the proposed framework to multi-class cell detection. For evaluation,

CNN-based paradigm, which is unable to model long-range dependencies across

Hierarchical Cross-modal Transformer (HCT), a new multi-modal transformer, to
tackle this problem. Unlike previous multi-modal transformers that directly
connecting all patches from two modalities, we explore the cross-modal
complementarity hierarchically to respect the modality gap and spatial
discrepancy in unaligned regions. Specifically, we propose to use intra-modal
self-attention to explore complementary global contexts, and measure
spatial-aligned inter-modal attention locally to capture cross-modal
correlations. In addition, we present a Feature Pyramid module for Transformer

the first method, the switching frequency is constant. Furthermore, in each
switching cycle, the pulse position is determined as a function of the duty
cycle in the current cycle and the pulse position in the previous cycle. Based
on random pulse width modulation techniques, the second method involves
establishing a unique relationship among the switching frequency, pulse

both proposed methods can create a gap in the power spectrum density (PSD) of
the line voltage at a specific frequency. The PSD using the second SNS method
is more uniform near integer multiples of the switching frequency than random

provide a valuable reference for effectively eliminating electromagnetic and

approach with one server and two FPGA boards with 100 Gbps network and measure
the memory access latency. Furthermore, we optimize the memory access path by
using data cache and congestion control algorithm in the critical path to
further lower access latency. The evaluation results show that the average
latency for the server to access remote memory is 1.97 {\mu}s, which is about
37% lower than the baseline latency in the industry. The latency can be further
reduced to 415 ns with cache block and hit access on FPGA.

advances from deep learning have shown promising prospects in fossil image
identification. However, the quantity and quality of labeled fossil images are
often limited due to fossil preservation, conditioned sampling, and expensive
and inconsistent label annotation by domain experts, which pose great
challenges to the training of deep learning based image classification models.
To address these challenges, we follow the idea of the wisdom of crowds and
propose a novel multiview ensemble framework, which collects multiple views of
each fossil specimen image reflecting its different characteristics to train
multiple base deep learning models and then makes final decisions via soft
voting. We further develop OGS method that integrates original, gray, and
skeleton views under this framework to demonstrate the effectiveness.
Experimental results on the fusulinid fossil dataset over five deep learning
based milestone models show that OGS using three base models consistently
outperforms the baseline using a single base model, and the ablation study
verifies the usefulness of each selected view. Besides, OGS obtains the
superior or comparable performance compared to the method under well-known
bagging framework. Moreover, as the available training data decreases, the
proposed framework achieves more performance gains compared to the baseline.
Furthermore, a consistency test with two human experts shows that OGS obtains
the highest agreement with both the labels of dataset and the two experts.
Notably, this methodology is designed for general fossil identification and it
is expected to see applications on other fossil datasets. The results suggest
the potential application when the quantity and quality of labeled data are
particularly restricted, e.g., to identify rare fossil images.

differ in the type of inputs (only video, or video-query pair where query is an
image region or sentence) and outputs (temporal segments or spatio-temporal
tubes). However, at their core they require the same fundamental understanding
of the video, i.e., the actors and objects in it, their actions and
interactions. So far these tasks have been tackled in isolation with
individual, highly specialized architectures, which do not exploit the
interplay between tasks. In contrast, in this paper, we present a single,
unified model for tackling query-based video understanding in long-form videos.
In particular, our model can address all three tasks of the Ego4D Episodic

egocentric video and a visual, textual or activity query, the goal is to
determine when and where the answer can be seen within the video. Our model

sliding window inference that allow multi-task training with diverse input

Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks by inserting a template into model

differences between the Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) and the current task.
But in the case of relation classification, it is difficult to map the masked
output to the relation labels because of its abundant semantic information,
e.g. org:founded_by''. Therefore, a pre-trained model still needs enough
labelled data to fit the relations. To mitigate this challenge, in this paper,
we present a novel prompt-based learning method, namely LabelPrompt, for the
relation classification task. It is an extraordinary intuitive approach by a
motivation: ``GIVE MODEL CHOICES!''. First, we define some additional tokens to
represent the relation labels, which regards these tokens as the verbalizer
with semantic initialisation and constructs them with a prompt template method.
Then we revisit the inconsistency of the predicted relation and the given
entities, an entity-aware module with the thought of contrastive learning is
designed to mitigate the problem. At last, we apply an attention query strategy
to self-attention layers to resolve two types of tokens, prompt tokens and
sequence tokens. The proposed strategy effectively improves the adaptation
capability of prompt-based learning in the relation classification task when
only a small labelled data is available. Extensive experimental results
obtained on several bench-marking datasets demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed LabelPrompt method, particularly in the few-shot scenario.

perpetuating the population as a whole. In this work we focus on the

damage in cells born at a given time asymptotically becomes fractal. By
exploiting the analogy of linear ADS models with the Iterated Function Systems

a $q$-deformation of matrix permanents: Given a complex number $q$ on the unit
circle in the complex plane and an $n\times n$ matrix $X$, the $q$-permanent of
$X$ is defined as $$\mathrm{Per}_q(X) = \sum_{\sigma\in S_n}
q^{\ell(\sigma)}X_{1,\sigma(1)}\ldots X_{n,\sigma(n)},$$ where $\ell(\sigma)$
is the inversion number of permutation $\sigma$ in the symmetric group $S_n$ on
$n$ elements. The function family generalizes determinant and permanent, which
correspond to the cases $q=-1$ and $q=1$ respectively.
  For worst-case hardness, by Liouville's approximation theorem and facts from
algebraic number theory, we show that for primitive $m$-th root of unity $q$
for odd prime power $m=p^k$, exactly computing $q$-permanent is
$\mathsf{Mod}_p\mathsf{P}$-hard. This implies that an efficient algorithm for
computing $q$-permanent results in a collapse of the polynomial hierarchy.
Next, we show that computing $q$-permanent can be achieved using an oracle that
approximates to within a polynomial multiplicative error and a membership
oracle for a finite set of algebraic integers. From this, an efficient
approximation algorithm would also imply a collapse of the polynomial
hierarchy. By random self-reducibility, computing $q$-permanent remains to be
hard for a wide range of distributions satisfying a property called the strong
autocorrelation property. Specifically, this is proved via a reduction from
$1$-permanent to $q$-permanent for $O(1/n^2)$ points $z$ on the unit circle.
Since the family of permanent functions shares common algebraic structure,
various techniques developed for the hardness of permanent can be generalized
to $q$-permanents.

short trajectory parallelization. Local kinetics between milestones are
aggregated to compute the flux through the entire reaction space. In addition
to the accuracy of force fields, the accuracy of Milestoning crucially depends
on two factors: the initial distribution of the short trajectory ensemble and
statistical adequacy of trajectory sampling. The latter can be improved by
increasing the number of trajectories while the true initial distribution,
i.e., first hitting point distribution (FHPD), has no analytic expression in
the general case. Here, we propose two algorithms, local passage time weighted
Milestoning (LPT-M) and Bayesian inference Milestoning (BI-M), to accurately
and efficiently approximate FHPD for systems at equilibrium condition. Starting
from equilibrium Boltzmann distribution on milestones, we calculate the proper
weighting factor for equilibrium FHPD approximation and consequently for
trajectory flux. The methods are tested on two model examples for illustration
purpose. Both methods improve significantly over the widely used classical
Milestoning method in terms of the accuracy of mean first passage time (MFPT).
In particular, BI-M covers the directional Milestoning method as a special case
in the deterministic Hamiltonian dynamics. LPT-M is especially advantageous in
terms of computational costs and robustness with respect to the increasing
number of intermediate milestones. Furthermore, a locally iterative correction
algorithm for FHPD is proposed for exact MFPT calculation on the basis of
LPT-M/BI-M, which is much cheaper than the exact Milestoning method.

Verbal autopsy (VA) is a routinely used tool to collect information on cause of

degradation of the VSR model on unseen speakers, we propose prompt tuning
methods of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for speaker-adaptive VSR. Specifically,
motivated by recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP), we finetune
prompts on adaptation data of target speakers instead of modifying the
pre-trained model parameters. Different from the previous prompt tuning methods
mainly limited to Transformer variant architecture, we explore different types
of prompts, the addition, the padding, and the concatenation form prompts that
can be applied to the VSR model which is composed of CNN and Transformer in
general. With the proposed prompt tuning, we show that the performance of the
pre-trained VSR model on unseen speakers can be largely improved by using a
small amount of adaptation data (e.g., less than 5 minutes), even if the
pre-trained model is already developed with large speaker variations. Moreover,
by analyzing the performance and parameters of different types of prompts, we
investigate when the prompt tuning is preferred over the finetuning methods.
The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on both word- and
sentence-level VSR databases, LRW-ID and GRID.

(PGE) and second harmonic generation (SHG), are important physical phenomena in
nonlinear optics. The PGE (SHG) related to linearly and circularly polarized
light are called the linear and circular PGE (LPGE and CPGE) [linear and
circular SHG (LSHG and CSHG)], respectively. In this work, we use the quantum
kinetics under relaxation time approximation to study the dependence of
second-order nonlinear optical responses on Fermi level and frequency under
different out-of-plane electric fields in WTe$_2$ monolayer from radio to
infrared region. We find that the maximum frequency at which the Berry
curvature dipole mechanism for the nonlinear Hall effect plays a major role is
about 1 THz. In radio and microwave regions, two large peaks of nonlinear
conductivities occur when the Fermi level is equal to the energy corresponding
to gap-opening points. In terms of frequency, in radio region, LPGE and SHG
conductivities maintain a large constant while the CPGE conductivity
disappears. In microwave region, LPGE and SHG start to decrease with increasing
frequency while the CPGE is large. In 125-300 THz region and in y direction,
the presence of DC current without the disturbance of second harmonic current
under circularly polarized light may be useful for fabricating new
optoelectronic devices. Moreover, we illustrate that when calculating the
nonlinear optical responses of practical materials, the theories in the clean
limit fail and it is necessary to use a theory that considers scattering
effects. We also point out that for materials with femtosecond-scale relaxation
times and complex energy band structures, the quantum kinetics is more accurate
than the semi-classical Boltzmann equation method. Besides, phenomenological
expressions of PGE and SHG are provided.

linear relaxations of semidefinite optimization programs (SDPs) using
instance-specific information. We get inspiration for our approach by studying
the celebrated SDP relaxation for max cut (GW) due to Poljak and Rendl [1995]
and analyzed by Goemans and Williamson [1995]. Using the instance at hand, we
provide a pair of closely related compact linear programs that sandwich the
optimal value of the GW semidefinite program. The instance specific information
allows us to trivially avoid hardness of approximation results of semidefinite
programs using linear ones, such as Braun et al. [2015] and Kothari et al.
[2021].
  We give sufficient conditions that guarantee that the optimal value of both
our programs match the optimal value of the semidefinite relaxation. We use
these conditions to prove that our two bounds give the same value as the GW SDP
for max cut on distance-regular graphs, and in particular, strongly regular
graphs such as cycles and the Petersen graph. Further, we show that the
approximation of the upper bounding problem is strictly better than the
eigenvalue bounds of Mohar and Poljak [1990], Alon and Sudakov [2000] for max
cut.
  To the best of our knowledge, no previously proposed linear program proposed
for max cut has this guarantee. We extensively test our methodology on
synthetic and real graphs, and show how our ideas perform in practice. Even
though our methodology is inspired by the SDP relaxation for max cut, we show
experimentally that our ideas can be applied successfully to obtain good
solutions to other computationally hard SDPs such as sparse PCA and the Lovasz
Theta number.

can be used to identify areas of concern or to provide additional information
to the clinician. In this paper, we review the various types of uncertainty in

further discuss how they can be estimated in medical imaging. More importantly,
we review recent advances in deep learning models that incorporate uncertainty

and the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), two of the most common
generalised uncertainty relations proposed in the quantum gravity literature,
can be derived within the context of canonical quantum theory, without the need
for modified commutation relations. A GUP-type relation naturally emerges when
the standard position operator is replaced by an appropriate Positive Operator
Valued Measure (POVM), representing a finite-accuracy measurement that
localises the quantum wave packet to within a spatial region $\sigma_g > 0$.
This length scale is the standard deviation of the envelope function, $g$, that
defines the POVM elements. Similarly, an EUP-type relation emerges when the
standard momentum operator is replaced by a POVM that localises the wave packet
to within a region $\tilde{\sigma}_g > 0$ in momentum space. The usual GUP and
EUP are recovered by setting $\sigma_g \simeq \sqrt{\hbar G/c^3}$, the Planck
length, and $\tilde{\sigma}_g \simeq \hbar\sqrt{\Lambda/3}$, where $\Lambda$ is
the cosmological constant. Crucially, the canonical Hamiltonian and commutation
relations, and, hence, the canonical Schr{\"" o}dinger and Heisenberg equations,
remain unchanged. This demonstrates that GUP and EUP phenomenology can be
obtained without modified commutators, which are known to lead to various
pathologies, including violation of the equivalence principle, violation of
Lorentz invariance in the relativistic limit, the reference frame-dependence of
the `minimum' length, and the so-called soccer ball problem for multi-particle
states.

little attention, or have not been considered at all in the existing
literature, with the aim of stimulating discussion on these topics. We then
show how an apparently simple assumption can solve, or, more precisely, evade
these issues, by generating GURs without modifying the basic form of the
canonical Heisenberg algebra. This simplicity is deceptive, however, as the
necessary assumption is found to have huge implications for the quantisation of
space-time and, therefore, gravity. These include the view that quantum
space-time should be considered as a quantum reference frame (QRF) and,
crucially, that the action scale characterising the quantum effects of gravity,
$\beta$, must be many orders of magnitude smaller than Planck's constant,
$\beta \sim 10^{-61} \times \hbar$, in order to recover the present day dark
energy density. We argue that these proposals should be taken seriously, as a
potential solution to the pathologies that plague minimum length models based

thoroughly as those of the existing paradigm, which has dominated research in

From numerical simulations, it is known that some secular resonances
may affect the motion of near-Earth objects (NEOs). However, the specific
location of the secular resonance inside the NEO region is not fully known,
because the methods previously used to predict their location can not be used
for highly eccentric orbits and when the NEOs cross the orbits of the planets.
  Aims. In this paper, we aim to map the secular resonances with the planets
from Venus to Saturn in the NEO region, even for high values of the
eccentricity.
  Methods. We used an averaged semi-analytical model that can deal with orbit
crossing singularities for the computation of the secular dynamics of NEOs,
from which we can obtain suitable proper elements and proper frequencies. Then,
we computed the proper frequencies over a uniform grid in the proper elements
space. Secular resonances are thus located by the level curves corresponding to
the proper frequencies of the planets.
  Results. We determined the location of the secular resonances with the
planets from Venus to Saturn, showing that they appear well inside the NEO
region. By using full numerical N-body simulations we also showed that the
location predicted by our method is fairly accurate. Finally, we provided some
indications about possible dynamical paths inside the NEO region, due to the
presence of secular resonances.

The topological excitations and ribbon operators are discussed in detail. The
gapped boundary and domain wall theories are also established, we show that the
gapped boundary is algebraically determined by a comodule algebra, or
equivalently, a module algebra; and the gapped domain wall is determined by the
bicomodule algebra, or equivalently, a bimodule algebra. The microscopic
lattice constructions of the gapped boundary and domain wall are discussed in
detail. We also introduce the weak Hopf tensor network states, via which we
solve the weak Hopf quantum double lattice models on closed and open surfaces.
The duality of the quantum double phases is discussed in the last part.

for long-term benefits but take actions that differ from the plan due to

to be caused by present bias, a tendency to overestimate immediate rewards and
underestimate future rewards. It is essential in behavioral economics to
investigate the relationship between present bias and time-inconsistency. In
this paper, we propose a model for analyzing agent behavior with present bias
in tasks to make progress toward a goal over a specific period. Unlike previous
models, the state sequence of the agent can be described analytically in our
model. Based on this property, we analyze three crucial problems related to
agents under present bias: task abandonment, optimal goal setting, and optimal
reward scheduling. Extensive analysis reveals how present bias affects the
condition under which task abandonment occurs and optimal intervention
strategies. Our findings are meaningful for preventing task abandonment and
intervening through incentives in the real world.

expanding the number of participants is a more effective approach to increase

to invite others because doing so intensifies competition among them. On the
other hand, misreporting social networks is also a common problem that can
reduce revenue. Examples of misreporting include Sybil attacks (an agent
pretending to be multiple bidders) and coalition groups (multiple agents
pretending to be an agent). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
mechanism called the Truthful Referral Diffusion Mechanism (TRDM). TRDM
incentivizes agents to report their social networks truthfully, and some of
them are rewarded by the seller for improving revenue. In spite of the fact
that some agents overbid in TRDM, the revenue is fixed, and it is higher than
the revenue of any mechanism without referrals. TRDM is budget-balanced
(non-negative revenue) and generates an efficient outcome (maximized social
welfare), making it attractive for both the seller and the buyers as it
improves revenue and reward.

Weinberg operator is unique in the standard model effective field theory

the SMEFT. We find the full contributions from the Weinberg operator to

For example, the classical Pearson's, Spearman's or Kendall's correlations are

(pQCD) is one of the crucial problems for achieving precise fixed-order pQCD
predictions. The conventional prescription is to take its value as the typical
momentum transfer $Q$ in a given process, and theoretical uncertainties are
then evaluated by varying it over an arbitrary range. The conventional
scale-setting procedure introduces arbitrary scheme-and-scale ambiguities in
fixed-order pQCD predictions. The principle of maximum conformality (PMC)
provides a systematic way to eliminate the renormalization scheme-and-scale
ambiguities. The PMC method has rigorous theoretical foundations; it satisfies
the renormalization group invariance (RGI) and all of the self-consistency
conditions derived from the renormalization group. The PMC has now been
successfully applied to many physical processes. In this paper, we summarize
recent PMC applications, including event shape observables and heavy quark pair
production near the threshold region in $e^+e^-$ annihilation and top-quark
decay at hadronic colliders. In addition, estimating the contributions related
to the uncalculated higher-order terms is also summarized. These results show
that the major theoretical uncertainties caused by different choices of $\mu_r$
are eliminated, and the improved pQCD predictions are thus obtained,
demonstrating the generality and applicability of the PMC.

achieved remarkable successes. Since its inception, many researchers have been
intrigued by the dark knowledge hidden in the outputs of the teacher model.
Recently, a study has demonstrated that knowledge distillation and label
smoothing can be unified as learning from soft labels. Consequently, how to
measure the effectiveness of the soft labels becomes an important question.
Most existing theories have stringent constraints on the teacher model or data
distribution, and many assumptions imply that the soft labels are close to the
ground-truth labels. This paper studies whether biased soft labels are still
effective. We present two more comprehensive indicators to measure the
effectiveness of such soft labels. Based on the two indicators, we give
sufficient conditions to ensure biased soft label based learners are
classifier-consistent and ERM learnable. The theory is applied to three
weakly-supervised frameworks. Experimental results validate that biased soft
labels can also teach good students, which corroborates the soundness of the
theory.

NOEMA observations addressed to constrain the spatial scale of the CO emission

approaching and receding gas, all located at a distance of 2-3~kpc on the West
and East side of the active nucleus. This high velocity gas (up to v_out=~1900
km/s) is not coincident with the rotation pattern of the CO gas in the host
galaxy disk. The estimated mass outflow rate shows that with a global mass
output of $\dot{M}_{H_2}$=~139$\pm$20$~M_\odot$~yr$^{-1}$, this powerful
galaxy-scale outflow is consistent with the wind conserving its energy, and
with a momentum rate boost of a factor of ~30 compared to the momentum rate of

architecture, Fourier neural operator (FNO) has been developed by directly
parameterising the integral kernel in the Fourier domain, and achieved
significant success in different parametric partial differential equations.
However, the Fourier transform of FNO requires the regular domain with uniform
grids, which means FNO is inherently inapplicable to complex geometric domains
widely existing in real applications. The eigenfunctions of the Laplace
operator can also provide the frequency basis in Euclidean space, and can even
be extended to Riemannian manifolds. Therefore, this research proposes a
Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) in which the kernel integral can be parameterised

grid limitation of FNO and can be applied to any complex geometries while
maintaining the discretisation-invariant property. The proposed method is
demonstrated on the Darcy flow problem with a complex 2d domain, and a

The emission produced in their wind-collision region (WCR) encodes information
of both the shocks properties and the relativistic electrons accelerated in
them. The recently discovered system Apep, a unique massive system hosting two
Wolf-Rayet stars, is the most powerful synchrotron radio emitter among the
known CWBs, being an exciting candidate to investigate the non-thermal
processes associated with stellar wind shocks.
  Aims: We intend to break the degeneracy between the relativistic particle
population and the magnetic field strength in the WCR of Apep by probing its
hard X-ray spectrum, where inverse-Compton (IC) emission is expected to
dominate.
  Methods: We observe Apep with NuSTAR for 60 ks and combine this with a
re-analysis of a deep archival XMM-Newton observation to better constrain the
X-ray spectrum. We use a non-thermal emission model to derive physical
parameters from the results.
  Results: We detect hard X-ray emission consistent with a power-law component.
This is compatible with IC emission produced in the WCR for a magnetic field of
100-160 mG and a fraction of ~1.5e-4 of the total wind kinetic power being
converted into relativistic electron acceleration.
  Conclusions: This is the first time that the non-thermal emission from a CWB
is detected both in radio and high energies. This allows us to derive the most
robust constraints of the particle acceleration efficiency and magnetic field
intensity in a CWB so far, reducing the typical uncertainty of a few orders of
magnitude to just within a factor of two. This constitutes an important step
forward in our characterisation of the physical properties of CWBs.

do this by generating populations of stars using the binary synthesis code
COMPAS and evolving them in galaxies from the semi-analytic galaxy formation
model {\sc Shark}, to determine the number of mergers occurring in each
simulation time-step. We find that large, metal-rich galaxies with high star
formation rates are more likely to have gravitational wave (GW) events compared
to younger, more metal poor galaxies. Our simulation with the default input
parameters predicts a higher local merger rate density compared to the third
gravitational wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) prediction from LIGO, VIRGO and
KAGRA. This is due to short coalescence times, low metallicities and an high
formation rate of stars at low redshift in the galaxy simulation, which
produces more BBHs that merge within the age of the Universe compared to
observations. We identify alternate remnant mass models that more accurately
reproduce the observed volumetric rate and provide updated fits to the merger
rate distribution as a function of redshift. We then investigate the relative
fraction of GW events in our simulation volume that are in observable host
galaxies from different upcoming photometric and spectroscopic surveys,
determining which of those are more ideal for tracing host galaxies with high
merger rates. The implications of this work can be utilised for numerous
applications, including for constraining stellar evolution models, better
informing follow-up programs, and placing more informative priors on potential

breaking remains an unresolved problem in fluid dynamics. Conceptually,
breaking can be described by inception and onset, where breaking inception is
the initiation of unknown irreversible processes within a wave crest that
precede the visible manifestation of breaking onset. In the search for an
energetic indicator of breaking inception, we use an ensemble of non-breaking
and breaking crests evolving within unsteady wave packets simulated in a
numerical wave tank to investigate the evolution of each term in the kinetic
energy balance equation. We observe that breaking onset is preceded by around
one quarter of a wave period by a rapid increase in the rate of convergence of
kinetic energy that triggers an irreversible acceleration of the kinetic energy
growth rate. This energetic signature, which is present only for crests that
subsequently break, arises when the kinetic energy growth rate exceeds a
critical threshold. At this point the additional kinetic energy convergence
cannot be offset by converting excess kinetic energy to potential energy or by
dissipation through friction. Our results suggest that the ratio of the leading
terms of the kinetic energy balance equation at the time of this energetic
signature is proportional to the strength of the breaking crest. Hence this
energetic inception point both predicts the occurrence of breaking onset and
indicates the strength of the breaking event.

magnitude of each filter and the linear dependence between filters into
consideration, WHC can robustly recognize the most redundant filters, which can
be safely pruned without introducing severe performance degradation to

the effectiveness of the proposed WHC. In particular, WHC can prune ResNet-50

Metal-Isulator-Semiconductor (MIS) structures with silicon nanocrystals (Si
NCs) based active layers embedded in the insulating SiO 2 oxide, for high
performance solar cell and photodetector applications. The Si NCs are produced
via the in situ solid-state dewetting of ultra-pure amorphous
silicon-oninsulator (a-SOI) grown by solid source molecular beam epitaxy
(SSMBE). The size and density of Si NCs are precisely tuned by varying the
deposited thickness of silicon. The morphological characterization carried out
by using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
shows that the Si NCs have homogeneous size with welldefined spherical shape
and densities up to ~10 12 /cm 2 (inversely proportional to the square of
nominal a-Si thickness). The structural investigations by high resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) show that the ultra-small Si NCs
(with mean diameter ~7 nm) are monocrystalline and free of structural defects.
The electrical measurements performed by current versus voltage (I-V) and
photocurrent spectroscopies on the Si-NCs based MIS structures prove the
efficiency of Si NCs to enhance the electrical conduction in MIS structures and
to increase (x10 times) the photocurrent (i.e. at bias voltage V =-1 V) via the
photogeneration of additional electron-hole pairs in the MIS structures. These
results evidence that the Si NCs obtained by the combination of MBE growth and
solid-state dewetting are perfectly suitable for the development of novel high
performance optoelectronic devices compatible with the CMOS technology.

eliminating the influence of speaker-specific information contained in

the content feature and source face, during which the landmark loss is designed
to enhance the accuracy of facial structure and identity preserving quality.
Finally, to achieve free pose control, controllable head pose features from

propagate downstream, affecting surrounding users and reducing their heat pump
efficiency. To reduce the probability of interference, regulators often rely on
simple analytical models or high fidelity groundwater simulations to determine
the impact that a heat pump has on the subsurface aquifer and surrounding heat
pumps. These are either too inaccurate or too computationally expensive for

within the subsurface aquifer around the heat pump. A data set consisting of
800 numerical simulation samples, generated from random permeability fields and

antenna spacing is generally no less than half a wavelength. It helps to reduce
the mutual coupling and therefore facilitate the system design. The maximum
array gain equals the number of antennas in this settings. However, when the
antenna spacing is made very small, the array gain of a compact array can be
proportional to the square of the number of antennas - a value much larger than
the traditional array. To achieve this so-called ``superdirectivity"" however,
the calculation of the excitation coefficients (beamforming vector) is known to
be a challenging problem. In this paper, we address this problem with a novel
double coupling-based superdirective beamforming method. In particular, we
categorize the antenna coupling effects to impedance coupling and field
coupling. By characterizing these two coupling in model, we derive the
beamforming vector for superdirective arrays. In order to obtain the field
coupling matrix, we propose a spherical wave expansion approach, which is
effective in both simulations and realistic scenarios. Moreover, a prototype of
the independently controlled superdirective antenna array is developed.
Full-wave electromagnetic simulations and real-world experiments validate the

algorithms can persist in discrimination. Indeed, when sensitive features are
omitted (fairness under unawareness), they could be inferred through non-linear
relations with the so called proxy features. In this work, we propose a way to
reveal the potential hidden bias of a machine learning model that can persist
even when sensitive features are discarded. This study shows that it is
possible to unveil whether the black-box predictor is still biased by
exploiting counterfactual reasoning. In detail, when the predictor provides a
negative classification outcome, our approach first builds counterfactual
examples for a discriminated user category to obtain a positive outcome. Then,
the same counterfactual samples feed an external classifier (that targets a
sensitive feature) that reveals whether the modifications to the user
characteristics needed for a positive outcome moved the individual to the
non-discriminated group. When this occurs, it could be a warning sign for
discriminatory behavior in the decision process. Furthermore, we leverage the
deviation of counterfactuals from the original sample to determine which
features are proxies of specific sensitive information. Our experiments show
that, even if the model is trained without sensitive features, it often suffers
discriminatory biases.

This limitation of a small number of event types does not meet our research
needs for more complex tasks such as the prediction of major financial events
and the analysis of the ripple effects of financial events. In this paper, a
three-stage approach is proposed to accomplish incremental discovery of event
types. For an existing annotated financial event dataset, the three-stage
approach consists of: for a set of financial event data with a mixture of
original and unknown event types, a semi-supervised deep clustering model with
anomaly detection is first applied to classify the data into normal and
abnormal events, where abnormal events are events that do not belong to known
types; then normal events are tagged with appropriate event types and abnormal
events are reasonably clustered. Finally, a cluster keyword extraction method
is used to recommend the type names of events for the new event clusters, thus
incrementally discovering new event types. The proposed method is effective in
the incremental discovery of new event types on real data sets.

geometric features (point, line, edge, etc.) for better performance. However,
these hand-crafted features are only suitable for specific natural scenes with
adequate geometric structures. In contrast, deep stitching schemes overcome the
adverse conditions by adaptively learning robust semantic features, but they
cannot handle large-parallax cases due to homography-based registration. To
solve these issues, we propose UDIS++, a parallax-tolerant unsupervised deep
image stitching technique. First, we propose a robust and flexible warp to
model the image registration from global homography to local thin-plate spline
motion. It provides accurate alignment for overlapping regions and shape
preservation for non-overlapping regions by joint optimization concerning
alignment and distortion. Subsequently, to improve the generalization
capability, we design a simple but effective iterative strategy to enhance the
warp adaption in cross-dataset and cross-resolution applications. Finally, to
further eliminate the parallax artifacts, we propose to composite the stitched
image seamlessly by unsupervised learning for seam-driven composition masks.
Compared with existing methods, our solution is parallax-tolerant and free from
laborious designs of complicated geometric features for specific scenes.
Extensive experiments show our superiority over the SoTA methods, both

used to approximate it. For instance, Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) corresponds to minimizing a reverse KL from an implicit target
distribution arising from a KL penalty in the objective. On the other hand,
Generative Distributional Control (GDC) has an explicit target distribution and
minimizes a forward KL from it using the Distributional Policy Gradient (DPG)
algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new approach, f-DPG, which allows the
use of any f-divergence to approximate any target distribution that can be
evaluated. f-DPG unifies both frameworks (RLHF, GDC) and the approximation
methods (DPG, RL with KL penalties). We show the practical benefits of various
choices of divergence objectives and demonstrate that there is no universally
optimal objective but that different divergences present different alignment
and diversity trade-offs. We show that Jensen-Shannon divergence strikes a good
balance between these objectives, and frequently outperforms forward KL
divergence by a wide margin, leading to significant improvements over prior
work. These distinguishing characteristics between divergences persist as the
model size increases, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate
divergence objectives.

parameter estimation, entail a huge computational complexity when dealing with
input-output maps involving the solution of nonlinear differential problems,
because of the need to query expensive numerical solvers repeatedly.
Projection-based reduced order models (ROMs), such as the Galerkin-reduced
basis (RB) method, have been extensively developed in the last decades to
overcome the computational complexity of high fidelity full order models
(FOMs), providing remarkable speedups when addressing UQ tasks related with
parameterized differential problems. Nonetheless, constructing a
projection-based ROM that can be efficiently queried usually requires extensive
modifications to the original code, a task which is non-trivial for nonlinear
problems, or even not possible at all when proprietary software is used.
Non-intrusive ROMs - which rely on the FOM as a black box - have been recently
developed to overcome this issue. In this work, we consider ROMs exploiting
proper orthogonal decomposition to construct a reduced basis from a set of FOM
snapshots, and Gaussian process regression (GPR) to approximate the RB
projection coefficients. Two different approaches, namely a global GPR and a
tensor-decomposition-based GPR, are explored on a set of 3D time-dependent
solid mechanics examples. Finally, the non-intrusive ROM is exploited to
perform global sensitivity analysis (relying on both screening and
variance-based methods) and parameter estimation (through Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods), showing remarkable computational speedups and very good
accuracy compared to high-fidelity FOMs.

latter are naturally connected to the presence of hard constraints like knots
and links within the polymer chains, the difficulty of integrating the rigorous
language of mathematical topology with the physics of polymer melts has limited
somehow a genuine topological approach to the problem of classifying these

this work, we tackle this problem by studying the occurrence of knots and links
in lattice melts of randomly knotted and randomly concatenated ring polymers of
various bending stiffness. Specifically, by introducing an algorithm which
shrinks the chains to their minimal shapes which do not violate topological
constraints and by analyzing those in terms of suitable topological invariants,
we provide a detailed characterization of the topological properties at the
intra-chain level (knots) and of links between pairs and triplets of distinct

time since injection. We find: (1) The synchrotron spectrum in the DM model is
similar to that in the homogeneous turbulence (HT) model with very low magnetic
field strength. However, the difference in the IC spectral component is
relatively more obvious between them, due to the significant change of the
postshock electron energy distribution with DM. (2) If the magnetic field decay
faster, there are less electrons cool fast, and the IC spectral component
becomes weaker. (3) The LCs in the DM model decay steeper than in the HT model,
and the spectral evolution and the LCs in the DM model is similar to the HT
model where the magnetic field energy fraction decreases with observer time,
$\epsilon_B(t) \propto t^{5\alpha_t /8}$. (4) The DM model can naturally
produce a significant IC spectral component in TeV energy range, but due to the
Klein-Nishina suppression the IC power cannot be far larger than the
synchrotron power. We apply the DM model to describe the afterglow data of GRB

bipartite graph that contains offline bins and online items, where each offline

is with a $D$-dimensional demand vector. Online arrivals are sampled from a set
of online item types which follow independent but not necessarily identical
Poisson processes. The arrival rate for each Poisson process is unknown. Each
online item will either be packed into an offline bin which will deduct the
allocated bin's capacity vector and generate a reward, or be rejected. The
decision should be made immediately and irrevocably upon its arrival. Our goal
is to maximize the total reward of the allocation without violating the
capacity constraints.
  We provide a sample-based multi-phase algorithm by utilizing both
pre-existing offline data (named historical data) and sequentially revealed
online data. We establish its performance guarantee measured by a competitive
ratio. In a simplified setting where $D=1$ and all capacities and demands are
equal to $1$, we prove that the ratio depends on the number of historical data

generalize the algorithm to the general multidimensional and multi-demand

capacity's (demand's) dimension on the algorithm's performance is further
analyzed based on the established parametric form. Finally, we demonstrate the

can learn from a never-ending data stream has attracted more interests
recently. In all settings, the online class incremental learning (CIL), where
incoming samples from data stream can be used only once, is more challenging
and can be encountered more frequently in real world. Actually, the CIL faces a
stability-plasticity dilemma, where the stability means the ability to preserve
old knowledge while the plasticity denotes the ability to incorporate new
knowledge. Although replay-based methods have shown exceptional promise, most
of them concentrate on the strategy for updating and retrieving memory to keep
stability at the expense of plasticity. To strike a preferable trade-off
between stability and plasticity, we propose a Adaptive Focus Shifting
algorithm (AFS), which dynamically adjusts focus to ambiguous samples and
non-target logits in model learning. Through a deep analysis of the
task-recency bias caused by class imbalance, we propose a revised focal loss to
mainly keep stability. By utilizing a new weight function, the revised focal
loss can pay more attention to current ambiguous samples, which can provide
more information of the classification boundary. To promote plasticity, we
introduce a virtual knowledge distillation. By designing a virtual teacher, it
assigns more attention to non-target classes, which can surmount overconfidence
and encourage model to focus on inter-class information. Extensive experiments
on three popular datasets for CIL have shown the effectiveness of AFS. The code

  Regularization","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperspectral (HS) unmixing is the process of decomposing an HS image into
material-specific spectra (endmembers) and their spatial distributions
(abundance maps). Existing unmixing methods have two limitations with respect
to noise robustness. First, if the input HS image is highly noisy, even if the
balance between sparse and piecewise-smooth regularizations for abundance maps
is carefully adjusted, noise may remain in the estimated abundance maps or
undesirable artifacts may appear. Second, existing methods do not explicitly
account for the effects of stripe noise, which is common in HS measurements, in
their formulations, resulting in significant degradation of unmixing
performance when such noise is present in the input HS image. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a new robust hyperspectral unmixing method based on
constrained convex optimization. Our method employs, in addition to the two
regularizations for the abundance maps, regularizations for the HS image
reconstructed by mixing the estimated abundance maps and endmembers. This
strategy makes the unmixing process much more robust in highly-noisy scenarios,
under the assumption that the abundance maps used to reconstruct the HS image
with desirable spatio-spectral structure are also expected to have desirable
properties. Furthermore, our method is designed to accommodate a wider variety
of noise including stripe noise. To solve the formulated optimization problem,
we develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual
splitting method, which can automatically determine appropriate stepsizes based
on the problem structure. Experiments on synthetic and real HS images
demonstrate the advantages of our method over existing methods.

superior performance, how to exactly exploit the complex data correlations
among nodes to reconstruct missing node features is still a great challenge. To
solve the above problem, we propose a self-supervised guided hypergraph feature
propagation (SGHFP). Specifically, the feature hypergraph is first generated
according to the node features with missing information. And then, the
reconstructed node features produced by the previous iteration are fed to a
two-layer GNNs to construct a pseudo-label hypergraph. Before each iteration,
the constructed feature hypergraph and pseudo-label hypergraph are fused
effectively, which can better preserve the higher-order data correlations among
nodes. After then, we apply the fused hypergraph to the feature propagation for

multi-iteration optimization are applied to the downstream semi-supervised

steepness statistics, with the overall goal to understand the cosmological
information embedded there in comparison with the commonly used peak height
statistics. We perform the analyses with ray-tracing simulations considering
different sets of cosmological parameters $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$. A
theoretical model to calculate the abundance of high peaks based on steepness
is also presented, which can well describe the main trend of the peak
distribution from simulations. We employ $\Delta\chi^2$ and Fisher analyses to
study the cosmological dependence of the two peak statistics using our limited
sets of simulations as well as our theoretical model. Within our considerations
without including potential systematic effects, the results show that the
steepness statistics tends to have higher sensitivities to the cosmological
parameters than the peak height statistics and this advantage is diluted with
the increase of the shape noise. Using the theoretical model, we investigate
the physical reasons accounting for the different cosmological information
embedded in the two statistics. Our analyses indicate that the projection
effect from large-scale structures plays an important role to enhance the gain
from the steepness statistics. The redshift and cosmology dependence of dark

students' aspirations. It sheds new light on the inequalities in tracking
between academic versus technological and vocational track. Through the
analysis of a national survey and a corpus of cover letters written by
applicants for a sociology degree, it shows that, due to the lack of means,
teachers mainly have two types of guidance support strategies.Teachers use to
target and concentrate their supporting on ``good students'' in vocational
tracks, while, in academic tracks, they delegate some steps of the tracking
procedures to families. These different strategies have effects on the way high
school students internalise school prescriptions and restitute them in cover
letters. Through the close support they benefit from teachers, ``good
students'' in vocational tracks strongly internalise the instructions and their
place in the school hierarchy. In academic tracks, students' expression of the
aspirations is much more dependent of their familial capital.

  Adversarial Examples",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial examples are carefully crafted attack points that are supposed to
fool machine learning classifiers. In the last years, the field of adversarial
machine learning, especially the study of perturbation-based adversarial
examples, in which a perturbation that is not perceptible for humans is added
to the images, has been studied extensively. Adversarial training can be used
to achieve robustness against such inputs. Another type of adversarial examples
are invariance-based adversarial examples, where the images are semantically
modified such that the predicted class of the model does not change, but the
class that is determined by humans does. How to ensure robustness against this
type of adversarial examples has not been explored yet. This work addresses the
impact of adversarial training with invariance-based adversarial examples on a
convolutional neural network (CNN).
  We show that when adversarial training with invariance-based and
perturbation-based adversarial examples is applied, it should be conducted
simultaneously and not consecutively. This procedure can achieve relatively
high robustness against both types of adversarial examples. Additionally, we
find that the algorithm used for generating invariance-based adversarial
examples in prior work does not correctly determine the labels and therefore we
use human-determined labels.

these features is the most important part of our research, as well as
establishing the appropriate statistical procedure to calculate the

of words among characters; distribution of characters in scenes, average length
of speech acts, or character-specific and macro-level network properties such
as clusterization coefficient and network density. Based on these metrics a
supervised classification procedure is applied to the sub-collections to
classify comedies and tragedies using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method.

reluctant to pass their personal sensitive data to a ML service provider. At
the same time, service providers have a strong interest in protecting their
intellectual property and therefore refrain from publicly sharing their ML
model. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) is a promising technique to enable
individuals using ML services without giving up privacy and protecting the ML
model of service providers at the same time. Despite steady improvements, FHE
is still hardly integrated in today's ML applications.
  We introduce HE-MAN, an open-source two-party machine learning toolset for
privacy preserving inference with ONNX models and homomorphically encrypted
data. Both the model and the input data do not have to be disclosed. HE-MAN
abstracts cryptographic details away from the users, thus expertise in FHE is
not required for either party. HE-MAN 's security relies on its underlying FHE
schemes. For now, we integrate two different homomorphic encryption schemes,
namely Concrete and TenSEAL. Compared to prior work, HE-MAN supports a broad
range of ML models in ONNX format out of the box without sacrificing accuracy.
We evaluate the performance of our implementation on different network
architectures classifying handwritten digits and performing face recognition
and report accuracy and latency of the homomorphically encrypted inference.
Cryptographic parameters are automatically derived by the tools. We show that
the accuracy of HE-MAN is on par with models using plaintext input while
inference latency is several orders of magnitude higher compared to the

integrating external biomedical knowledge into the GML pipeline to realise more

However, a systematic definition for this burgeoning research direction is yet

long-standing drug discovery principles, provides the foundational concepts and
cutting-edge techniques for graph-structured data and knowledge databases, and
formally summarises Knowledge-augmented Graph Machine Learning (KaGML) for drug

the nonlinear representation of neural networks, we propose Meta-Auto-Decoder

fine-tuning the trial manifold at the same time. Extensive numerical

Explanations are a promising way to create understanding, but current

existent theories on how understanding is formed and evaluated. In this work,
we aim to contribute to a better understanding of understanding by conducting a
qualitative task-based study with 30 participants, including users and affected
stakeholders. We use three explanation modalities (textual, dialogue, and
interactive) to explain a ""high-risk"" ADM system to participants and analyse
their responses both inductively and deductively, using the ""six facets of
understanding"" framework by Wiggins & McTighe. Our findings indicate that the
""six facets"" framework is a promising approach to analyse participants' thought
processes in understanding, providing categories for both rational and
emotional understanding. We further introduce the ""dialogue"" modality as a
valid explanation approach to increase participant engagement and interaction
with the ""explainer"", allowing for more insight into their understanding in the
process. Our analysis further suggests that individuality in understanding
affects participants' perceptions of algorithmic fairness, demonstrating the
interdependence between understanding and ADM assessment that previous studies
have outlined. We posit that drawing from theories on learning and
understanding like the ""six facets"" and leveraging explanation modalities can
guide XAI research to better suit explanations to learning processes of
individuals and consequently enable their assessment of ethical values of ADM

discriminating between positive (i.e., clicked by a user) and negative items

empirically find that the commonly used uniform negative sampling strategy for
pairwise algorithms (e.g., BPR) can inherit such data bias and oversample the
majority item group as negative instances, severely countering group fairness
on the item side. In this paper, we propose a Fairly adaptive Negative sampling
approach (FairNeg), which improves item group fairness via adaptively adjusting
the group-level negative sampling distribution in the training process. In
particular, it first perceives the model's unfairness status at each step and
then adjusts the group-wise sampling distribution with an adaptive momentum
update strategy for better facilitating fairness optimization. Moreover, a
negative sampling distribution Mixup mechanism is proposed, which gracefully
incorporates existing importance-aware sampling techniques intended for mining
informative negative samples, thus allowing for achieving multiple optimization
purposes. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show our proposed

of low-dimensional semiconductors in the presence of charge carriers (holes or
electrons). Trion emission from semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWCNTs) occurs in the near-infrared and at lower energies compared to the
respective exciton. It can be used as an indicator for the presence of excess
charge carriers in SWCNT samples and devices. Both excitons and trions are
highly sensitive to the surrounding dielectric medium of the nanotubes, having
an impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, the influence
of different dielectric materials on exciton and trion emission from
electrostatically doped networks of polymer-sorted (6,5) SWCNTs in top-gate
field-effect transistors is investigated. The observed differences of trion and
exciton emission energies and intensities for hole and electron accumulation
cannot be explained with the polarizability or screening characteristics of the
different dielectric materials, but they show a clear dependence on the charge
trapping properties of the dielectrics. Charge localization (trapping of holes
or electrons by the dielectric) reduces exciton quenching, emission blue-shift
and trion formation. Based on the observed carrier type and dielectric material
dependent variations, the ratio of trion to exciton emission and the exciton
blue-shift are not suitable as quantitative metrics for doping levels of carbon
nanotubes.

splines) are two common ways to extend bivariate polynomials to splines.
However, combination of both approaches leads to splines defined over mixed
triangle and quadrilateral meshes using the isogeometric approach. Mixed meshes
are especially useful for representing complicated geometries obtained e.g.
from trimming. As (bi)-linearly parameterized mesh elements are not flexible
enough to cover smooth domains, we focus in this work on the case of planar
mixed meshes parameterized by (bi)-quadratic geometry mappings. In particular
we study in detail the space of $C^1$-smooth isogeometric spline functions of
general polynomial degree over two such mixed mesh elements. We present the
theoretical framework to analyze the smoothness conditions over the common
interface for all possible configurations of mesh elements. This comprises the
investigation of the dimension as well as the construction of a basis of the
corresponding $C^1$-smooth isogeometric spline space over the domain described
by two elements. Several examples of interest are presented in detail.

top-philic interactions that can be probed at proton machines such as the Large
Hadron Collider through a variety of production and decay modes. On the one
hand, this will enable a detailed determination of the BSM model's parameters
when a discovery is made and additional sensitivity in non-dominant production
modes can be achieved. On the other hand, the naive narrow width approximation
in dominant production modes such as gluon fusion might be inadequate for some
BSM parameter regions due to interference effects, effectively making less
dominant production modes more relevant in such instances. In this work, we
consider both these questions in the context of four top quark final states at
the LHC. Firstly, we show that the SM potential can be enhanced through the
application of targeted Graph Neural Network techniques that exploit data
correlations beyond cut-and-count approaches. Secondly, we show that
destructive interference effects that can degrade BSM sensitivity of top-philic
states from gluon fusion are largely avoided by turning to four top final
states. This achieves considerable exclusion potential for, e.g., the two Higgs
doublet model. This further motivates four top final states as sensitive tools
for BSM discovery in the near future of the LHC.

The decay $J/\psi \to \gamma \eta$ is used to select clean samples of 631,686

The matrix elements for both channels are in reasonable agreement with previous

$\eta\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ is confirmed, as reported by the KLOE Collaboration,
while the other higher-order terms are found to be insignificant. Dalitz plot
asymmetries in the $\eta\to\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ decay are also explored and are
found to be consistent with charge conjugation invariance. In addition, a cusp
effect is investigated in the $\eta\to\pi^0\pi^0\pi^0$ decay, and no obvious

connected spanning subdigraph of $D$ in which every vertex except the vertex
$u$, called the root, has in-degree (out-degree) one. A {\bf good
$\mathbf{(u,v)}$-pair} in $D$ is a pair of branchings $B^+_u,B^-_v$ which have
no arc in common.
  Thomassen proved that is NP-complete to decide if a digraph has any good
pair. A digraph is {\bf semicomplete} if it has no pair of non adjacent
vertices. A {\bf semicomplete composition} is any digraph $D$ which is obtained
from a semicomplete digraph $S$ by substituting an arbitrary digraph $H_x$ for
each vertex $x$ of $S$.
  Recently the authors of this paper gave a complete classification of
semicomplete digraphs which have a good $(u,v)$-pair, where $u,v$ are
prescribed vertices of $D$. They also gave a polynomial algorithm which for a
given semicomplete digraph $D$ and vertices $u,v$ of $D$, either produces a
good $(u,v)$-pair in $D$ or a certificate that $D$ has such pair. In this paper
we show how to use the result for semicomplete digraphs to completely solve the
problem of deciding whether a given semicomplete composition $D$, has a good
$(u,v)$-pair for given vertices $u,v$ of $D$. Our solution implies that the
problem is polynomially solvable for all semicomplete compositions. In
particular our result implies that there is a polynomial algorithm for deciding
whether a given quasi-transitive digraph $D$ has a good $(u,v)$-pair for given
vertices $u,v$ of $D$. This confirms a conjecture of Bang-Jensen and Gutin from
1998.

architecture based on the emerging concept of hybrid in-crossbar and
near-crossbar memristive processing-in-memory (PIM). We enable efficient and
high-quality classification by uniting the filter and search stages within a
single algorithm. Specifically, we propose a custom filtering technique that
drastically narrows the search space and a search approach that facilitates
approximate string matching through a distance function. ClaPIM is the first
PIM architecture for scalable approximate string matching that benefits from
the high density of memristive crossbar arrays and the massive computational
parallelism of PIM. Compared with Kraken2, a state-of-the-art software
classifier, ClaPIM provides significantly higher classification quality (up to
20x improvement in F1 score) and also demonstrates a 1.8x throughput
improvement. Compared with EDAM, a recently-proposed SRAM-based accelerator
that is restricted to small datasets, we observe both a 30.4x improvement in
normalized throughput per area and a 7% increase in classification precision.

However, in the real world, we do not always have such ground truths, and thus
do not know which sample is correctly detected and cannot compute the metric
like AUROC to evaluate the performance of different OOD detection methods. In
this paper, we are the first to introduce the unsupervised evaluation problem
in OOD detection, which aims to evaluate OOD detection methods in real-world
changing environments without OOD labels. We propose three methods to compute
Gscore as an unsupervised indicator of OOD detection performance. We further
introduce a new benchmark Gbench, which has 200 real-world OOD datasets of
various label spaces to train and evaluate our method. Through experiments, we
find a strong quantitative correlation betwwen Gscore and the OOD detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Gscore achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Gscore also generalizes well with different
IND/OOD datasets, OOD detection methods, backbones and dataset sizes. We
further provide interesting analyses of the effects of backbones and IND/OOD
datasets on OOD detection performance. The data and code will be available.

outside galaxies, which is usually explained by assuming the existence of dark
matter, is the result of the dynamical evolution of particles in a Weyl type
geometry, and its associated conformally invariant Weyl geometric quadratic
gravity. As a first step in our investigations we write down the simplest
possible conformally invariant gravitational action, constructed in Weyl
geometry, and containing the Weyl scalar, and the strength of the Weyl vector
only. By introducing an auxiliary scalar field, the theoretical model can be
reformulated in the Riemann geometry as scalar-vector-tensor theory, containing
a scalar field, and the Weyl vector, respectively. The field equations of the
theory are derived in the metric formalism, in the absence of matter. A
specific static, spherically symmetric model, in which the Weyl vector has only
a radial component, is considered. In this case, an exact analytic solution of
the gravitational field equations can be obtained. The behavior of the galactic
rotation curves is also considered in detail, and it is shown that an effective
geometric mass term, with an associated density profile, can also be
introduced. Three particular cases, corresponding to some specific functional
forms of the Weyl vector, are also investigated. A comparison of the model with
a selected sample of galactic rotation curves is also performed when an
explicit breaking of conformal invariance is introduced, which allows the fix
of the numerical values of the free parameters of the model. Our results show
that Weyl geometric models can be considered as a viable theoretical
alternative to the dark matter paradigm.

manually and evaluate them because it costs a lot of time and effort for human

by quantifying the mutual gaze performance of children receiving play-based
autism interventions using an automated mutual gaze detection framework. Our
analysis is based on a video dataset that captures and records social
interactions between children with autism and their therapy trainers (N=28
observations, 84 video clips, 21 Hrs duration). The effectiveness of our
framework was evaluated by comparing the mutual gaze ratio derived from the
mutual gaze detection framework with the human-coded ratio values. We analyzed
the mutual gaze frequency and duration across different therapy settings,
activities, and sessions. We created mutual gaze-related measures for social
visual behavior score prediction using multiple machine learning-based
regression models. The results show that our method provides mutual gaze
measures that reliably represent (or even replace) the human coders' hand-coded
social gaze measures and effectively evaluates and predicts ASD children's
social visual performance during the intervention. Our findings have
implications for social interaction analysis in small-group behavior

conjunction with inertial data fusion to estimate link positions. SLAM is a
method that tracks a target in a reconstructed map of the environment using a
camera. This paper proposes quaternion-based extended and square-root unscented
Kalman filters (EKF & SRUKF) algorithms for pose estimation. The Kalman filters
use measurements based on SLAM position data, multi-link biomechanical
constraints, and vertical referencing to correct errors. In addition to the
sensor biases, the fusion algorithm is capable of estimating link geometries,
allowing the imposing of biomechanical constraints without a priori knowledge
of sensor positions. An optical tracking system is used as a reference of
ground-truth to experimentally evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithm in various scenarios of human arm movements. The proposed algorithms
achieve up to 5.87 (cm) and 1.1 (deg) accuracy in position and attitude
estimation. Compared to the EKF, the SRUKF algorithm presents a smoother and
higher convergence rate but is 2.4 times more computationally demanding. After
convergence, the SRUKF is up to 17% less and 36% more accurate than the EKF in
position and attitude estimation, respectively. Using an absolute position
measurement method instead of SLAM produced 80% and 40%, in the case of EKF,

works by first building a surrogate for the objective and quantifying the
uncertainty in that surrogate. It then decides where to sample by maximizing an
acquisition function defined by the surrogate model. Prior approaches typically
use randomly generated raw samples to initialize the acquisition function
maximizer. However, this strategy is ill-suited for high-dimensional BO. Given
the large regions of high posterior uncertainty in high dimensions, a randomly
initialized acquisition function maximizer is likely to focus on areas with
high posterior uncertainty, leading to overly exploring areas that offer little
gain. This paper provides the first comprehensive empirical study to reveal the
importance of the initialization phase of acquisition function maximization. It
proposes a better initialization approach by employing multiple heuristic
optimizers to leverage the knowledge of already evaluated samples to generate
initial points to be explored by an acquisition function maximizer. We evaluate
our approach on widely used synthetic test functions and real-world
applications. Experimental results show that our techniques, while simple, can
significantly enhance the standard BO and outperforms state-of-the-art
high-dimensional BO techniques by a large margin in most test cases.

presented randomized algorithms that produce such points using $\tilde

dimension $d$. It has been an open problem as to whether a similar result can
be obtained via a deterministic algorithm. We resolve this open problem,
showing that randomization is necessary to obtain a dimension-free rate. In
particular, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ for any deterministic
algorithm. Moreover, we show that unlike smooth or convex optimization, access
to function values is required for any deterministic algorithm to halt within
any finite time.
  On the other hand, we prove that if the function is even slightly smooth,
then the dimension-free rate of $\tilde O(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$ can be
obtained by a deterministic algorithm with merely a logarithmic dependence on
the smoothness parameter. Motivated by these findings, we turn to study the
complexity of deterministically smoothing Lipschitz functions. Though there are
efficient black-box randomized smoothings, we start by showing that no such
deterministic procedure can smooth functions in a meaningful manner, resolving
an open question. We then bypass this impossibility result for the structured
case of ReLU neural networks. To that end, in a practical white-box setting in
which the optimizer is granted access to the network's architecture, we propose
a simple, dimension-free, deterministic smoothing that provably preserves
$(\delta,\epsilon)$-stationary points. Our method applies to a variety of
architectures of arbitrary depth, including ResNets and ConvNets. Combined with
our algorithm, this yields the first deterministic dimension-free algorithm for
optimizing ReLU networks, circumventing our lower bound.

optimal consumption with wealth tracking of a non-decreasing benchmark process.
In particular, the monotone benchmark is modelled by the running maximum of a
drifted Brownian motion. We consider a relaxed tracking formulation using
capital injection such that the wealth compensated by the injected capital
dominates the benchmark process at all times. The stochastic control problem is
to maximize the expected utility on consumption deducted by the cost of the
capital injection under the dynamic floor constraint. By introducing two
auxiliary state processes with reflections, an equivalent auxiliary control
problem is formulated and studied such that the singular control of capital
injection and the floor constraint can be hidden. To tackle the HJB equation
with two Neumann boundary conditions, we establish the existence of a unique
classical solution to the dual PDE in a separation form using some novel
probabilistic representations involving the dual reflected processes and the
local time, and a homogenization technique of Neumann boundary conditions. The
proof of the verification theorem on the optimal feedback control can be
carried out by some technical stochastic flow analysis of the dual reflected

above a finite phase-transition density, and adding short-range interactions is
believed not to qualitatively change their thermal stabilities. By molecular
dynamics simulation, however, we find that adding a short-range Lennard-Jones
interaction on each vertex of the hard regular triangle leads to ground-state
degeneracy of the triangular system due to the fact that the unit cell of the
crystal formed by a dimer has two isotopic structures with identical potential
energies, which induces spontaneous crystalline instability and allows the
system to be in the glassy state at any finite temperatures before liquidizing.
At a fixed finite temperature, the initial crystalline structure eventually
evolves to the glassy state spontaneously through a down-hill process after it
comes over a single energy barrier. This mechanism is further verified by the

is requiring new paradigms for early-phase clinical trial methodologies to
enable us to evaluate efficacy of several subtypes simultaneously and
efficiently. The concept of the basket trial is getting of much attention to
realize this requirement borrowing information across subtypes, which are
called baskets. Bayesian approach is a natural approach to this end and indeed
the majority of the existing proposals relies on it. On the other hand, it
required complicated modeling and may not necessarily control the type 1 error
probabilities at the nominal level. In this paper, we develop a purely
frequentist approach for basket trials based on one-sample Mantel-Haenszel
procedure relying on a very simple idea for borrowing information under the
common treatment effect assumption over baskets. We show that the proposed
estimator is consistent under two limiting models of the large strata and
sparse data limiting models (dually consistent) and propose dually consistent
variance estimators. The proposed Mantel-Haenszel estimators are interpretable
even if the common treatment assumptions are violated. Then, we can design
basket trials in a confirmatory matter. We also propose an information
criterion approach to identify effective subclass of baskets.

substantially enlarges the applicable range of PINNs to nonsmooth cases of
PDE-constrained optimization problems. The application of the ADMM makes it
possible to untie the PDE constraints and the nonsmooth regularization terms
for iterations. Accordingly, at each iteration, one of the resulting
subproblems is a smooth PDE-constrained optimization which can be efficiently
solved by PINNs, and the other is a simple nonsmooth optimization problem which
usually has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved by various
standard optimization algorithms or pre-trained neural networks. The ADMM-PINNs
algorithmic framework does not require to solve PDEs repeatedly, and it is
mesh-free, easy to implement, and scalable to different PDE settings. We
validate the efficiency of the ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework by different
prototype applications, including inverse potential problems, source

for next 6G generation wireless communication networks. An STMM augments the

Hence, STMM represents an evolution of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces

without a relevant increase in the energy budget, which is convenient for

flexibility, whereas the other is more cost-effective. The model describes
STMM's distinguishing features, such as space-time coupling, and their impact

schedule power injection from the grid as well as SESS according to their

demand simultaneously. SESS is encouraged to charge when the price is low, thus
providing as much energy as possible for users while achieving energy savings.
However, due to the complex dynamics of buildings and real-time external

framework with state-aware reward functions, SESS and users can realize power
scheduling to meet the users' energy demand and SESS's charging/discharging
balance without additional communication, so as to achieve energy optimization.

sub-parsec separations in observations are still elusive. Recently,
unprecedented spatial resolutions achieved by GRAVITY/GRAVITY+ onboard The Very
Large Telescope Interferometer through spectroastrometry (SA) provide new
opportunities to resolve CB-SMBHs. Differential phase curves of CB-SMBHs with
two independent broad-line regions (BLRs) are found to have distinguished
characteristic structures from a single BLR \citep{songsheng2019}. Once the
CB-SMBH evolves to the stage where BLRs merge to form a circumbinary BLR, it
will hopefully be resolved by the pulsar timing array (PTA) in the near future
as sources of nano-hertz gravitational waves. In this work, we use a
parameterized model for circumbinary BLRs to calculate line profiles and
differential phase curves for SA observations. We show that both profiles and
phase curves exhibit asymmetries caused by the Doppler boosting effect of
accretion disks around individual black holes, depending on the orbital
parameters of the binary and geometries of the BLR. We also generate mock SA
data using the model and then recover orbital parameters by fitting the mock

affected by multiple sources of uncertainty such as precipitation and land
surface conditions. To quantify and curb these uncertainties, an ensemble-based
simulation and data assimilation model for pluvial flood inundation is
constructed. The shallow water equation is decoupled in the x and y directions,
and the inertial form of the Saint-Venant equation is chosen to realize fast
computation. The probability distribution of the input and output factors is
described using Monte Carlo samples. Subsequently, a particle filter is
incorporated to enable the assimilation of hydrological observations and
improve prediction accuracy. To achieve high-resolution, real-time ensemble
simulation, heterogeneous computing technologies based on CUDA (compute unified
device architecture) and a distributed storage multi-GPU (graphics processing
unit) system are used. Multiple optimization skills are employed to ensure the
parallel efficiency and scalability of the simulation program. Taking an urban
area of Fuzhou, China as an example, a model with a 3-m spatial resolution and
4.0 million units is constructed, and 8 Tesla P100 GPUs are used for the
parallel calculation of 96 model instances. Under these settings, the ensemble
simulation of a 1-hour hydraulic process takes 2.0 minutes, which achieves a
2680 estimated speedup compared with a single-thread run on CPU. The
calculation results indicate that the particle filter method effectively
constrains simulation uncertainty while providing the confidence intervals of
key hydrological elements such as streamflow, submerged area, and submerged
water depth. The presented approaches show promising capabilities in handling
the uncertainties in flood modeling as well as enhancing prediction efficiency.

algorithms. In this paper, we study the effect of bias on two popular consensus
protocols, namely, the {\em voter rule} and the {\em 2-choices rule} with
binary opinions. We assume that agents with opinion $1$ update their opinion
with a probability $q_1$ strictly less than the probability $q_0$ with which
update occurs for agents with opinion $0$. We call opinion $1$ as the superior
opinion and our interest is to study the conditions under which the network
reaches consensus on this opinion. We assume that the agents are located on the
vertices of a regular expander graph with $n$ vertices. We show that for the
voter rule, consensus is achieved on the superior opinion in $O(\log n)$ time
with high probability even if system starts with only $\Omega(\log n)$ agents
having the superior opinion. This is in sharp contrast to the classical voter
rule where consensus is achieved in $O(n)$ time and the probability of
achieving consensus on any particular opinion is directly proportional to the
initial number of agents with that opinion. For the 2-choices rule, we show
that consensus is achieved on the superior opinion in $O(\log n)$ time with
high probability when the initial proportion of agents with the superior
opinion is above a certain threshold. We explicitly characterise this threshold
as a function of the strength of the bias and the spectral properties of the
graph. We show that for the biased version of the 2-choice rule this threshold
can be significantly less than that for the unbiased version of the same rule.
Our techniques involve using sharp probabilistic bounds on the drift to
characterise the Markovian dynamics of the system.

the atmospheres of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, exoplanets, and brown
dwarfs. In these environments dust and cloud particles grow to macroscopic
sizes when gas phase species condense onto cloud condensation nuclei (CCNs).
Understanding the formation processes of CCNs and dust in AGB stars is
important because the species that formed in their outflows enrich the
interstellar medium. Although widely used, the validity of chemical and thermal
equilibrium conditions is debatable in some of these highly dynamical
astrophysical environments. We aim to derive a kinetic nucleation model that
includes the effects of thermal non-equilibrium by adopting different
temperatures for nucleating species, and to quantify the impact of thermal
non-equilibrium on kinetic nucleation. Forward and backward rate coefficients
are derived as part of a collisional kinetic nucleation theory ansatz. The
endothermic backward rates are derived from the law of mass action in thermal
non-equilibrium. We consider elastic collisions as thermal equilibrium drivers.
For homogeneous TiO2 nucleation and a gas temperature of 1250 K, we find that
differences in the kinetic cluster temperatures as small as 20 K increase the
formation of larger TiO2 clusters by over an order of magnitude. An increase in
cluster temperature of around 20 K at gas temperatures of 1000 K can reduce the
formation of a larger TiO2 cluster by over an order of magnitude. Our results
confirm and quantify the prediction of previous thermal non-equilibrium
studies. Small thermal non-equilibria can cause a significant change in the
synthesis of larger clusters. Therefore, it is important to use kinetic
nucleation models that include thermal non-equilibrium to describe the
formation of clusters in environments where even small thermal non-equilibria

space-/satellite-based systems. In particular, we practically and successfully
implement and demonstrate the first (to our knowledge) attacks on COSPAS-SARSAT
406 MHz protocols, namely replay, spoofing, and protocol fuzzing on EPIRB
protocols. We also identify a set of core research challenges preventing more
effective cybersecurity research in the field and outline the main
cybersecurity weaknesses and possible mitigations to increase the system's
cybersecurity level.

sentence-level style transfer without considering contextual information, and
the style is described with attributes (e.g., formality). When applying style
transfer on conversations such as task-oriented dialogues, existing approaches
suffer from these limitations as context can play an important role and the
style attributes are often difficult to define in conversations. In this paper,
we introduce conversation style transfer as a few-shot learning problem, where
the model learns to perform style transfer by observing only the target-style
dialogue examples. We propose a novel in-context learning approach to solve the
task with style-free dialogues as a pivot. Human evaluation shows that by
incorporating multi-turn context, the model is able to match the target style
while having better appropriateness and semantic correctness compared to
utterance-level style transfer. Additionally, we show that conversation style
transfer can also benefit downstream tasks. Results on multi-domain intent
classification tasks show improvement in F1 scores after transferring the style
of training data to match the style of test data.

trans-series, in which one adds to the perturbative series a typically infinite
sum of exponentially small corrections, due to instantons or to renormalons.
Even after Borel resummation of the series in the coupling constant, one has to
sum this infinite series of small exponential corrections. It has been argued
that this leads to a new divergence, which is sometimes called the divergence
of the OPE. We show that, in some interesting examples in quantum field theory,
the series of small exponential corrections is convergent, order by order in
the coupling constant. In particular, we give numerical evidence for this
convergence property in the case of the free energy of integrable
asymptotically free theories, which has been intensively studied recently in
the framework of resurgence. Our results indicate that, in these examples, the
Borel resummed trans-series leads to a well defined function, and there are no
further divergences.

shaking or shading can remove dependencies that are completely unused by a
project, which partly address these challenges. Yet, the remaining dependencies
are likely to be used only partially, leaving room for further reduction of
third-party code. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to specialize
dependencies of Java projects, based on their actual usage. For each
dependency, we systematically identify the subset of its functionalities that
is necessary to build the project, and remove the rest. Each specialized
dependency is repackaged. Then, we generate specialized dependency trees where
the original dependencies are replaced by the specialized versions and we
rebuild the project. We implement our technique in a tool called DepTrim, which
we evaluate with 30 notable open-source Java projects. DepTrim specializes a
total of 343 (86.6%) dependencies across these projects, and successfully
rebuilds each project with a specialized dependency tree. Moreover, through
this specialization, DepTrim removes a total of 60,962 (47.0%) classes from the

8.7x in the original projects to 4.4x after specialization. These results
indicate the relevance of dependency specialization to significantly reduce the

oscillations when attached to structural components. Powder bed fusion additive
manufacturing of metals allows to integrate particle inclusions of arbitrary
shape, size and spatial distribution directly into bulk material, giving rise
to novel metamaterials with controllable dissipation without the need for
additional external damping devices. At present, however, it is not well
understood how the degree of dissipation is influenced by the properties of the
enclosed powder packing. In the present work, a two-way coupled discrete
element - finite element model is proposed allowing for the first time to
consistently describe the interaction between oscillating deformable structures
and enclosed powder packings. As fundamental test case, the free oscillations
of a hollow cantilever beam filled with various powder packings differing in
packing density, particle size, and surface properties are considered to
systematically study these factors of influence. Critically, it is found that
the damping characteristics strongly depend on the packing density of the
enclosed powder and that an optimal packing density exists at which the
dissipation is maximized. Moreover, it is found that the influence of
(absolute) particle size on dissipation is rather small. First-order analytical
models for different deformation modes of such powder cavities are derived to
shed light on this observation.

understanding of excitonic properties of 1L WSe2. We find that the states
consist of hybridized excitations around the corresponding valleys which leads
to brightening of the dark excitons, i.e., significantly decreasing their
lifetime which is reflected in the PL spectrum. Using many-body perturbation
theory, we calculate the phonon contribution to the energy bandgap and the
linewidths of the excited electrons, holes and (bright) exciton to find that as
the temperature increases the bandgap significantly decreases, while the
linewidths increase. Our work paves for describing the ultrafast charge

propose an efficient channel estimation scheme to reduce the training overhead

  arXiv:2111.14723",,,,"quant-ph hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The so-called quantum measurement problems are solved from a new perspective.
One of the main observations is that the basic entities of our world are {\it
particles}, elementary or composite. It follows that each elementary process,
hence each measurement process at its core, is a spacetime, pointlike, event.
Another key idea is that, when a microsystem $\psi$ gets into contact with the
experimental device, factorization of $\psi$ rapidly fails and entangled mixed
states appear. The wave functions for the microsystem-apparatus coupled system
for different measurement outcomes then lack overlapping spacetime support. It
means that the aftermath of each measurement is a single term in the sum: a
``wave-function collapse"". Our discussion leading to a diagonal density matrix,
$\rho= {\rm diag} ( |c_1|^2, \ldots, |c_n|^2, \ldots )$ shows how the
information encoded in the wave function $|\psi\rangle = \sum_n c_n | n \rangle
$ gets transcribed, via entanglement with the experimental device and
environment, into the relative frequencies ${\cal P}_n = |c_n|^2$ for various
experimental outcomes $F=f_n$. Our discussion represents the first, significant
steps towards filling in the logical gaps in the conventional interpretation
based on Born's rule, replacing it with a clearer understanding of quantum
mechanics. Accepting objective reality of quantum fluctuations, independent of
any experiments, and independently of human presence, one renounces the idea
that in a fundamental, complete theory of Nature the result of each single
experiment must necessarily be predictable.

suggested\cite{Volovik2023b} that one can introduce two Planck constants, which
are the parameters of the corresponding components of Minkowski metric. In the
AK theory, the interval $ds$ is dimensionless, as a result the metric elements
and thus the Planck constants have nonzero dimensions. The Planck constant
$\hbar$ has dimension of time, and the second Planck constant $\hslash$ has
dimension of length. It is natural to compare $\hslash$ with the Planck length
$l_{\rm P}$, which is related to the Newton constant as $l_{\rm P}^2= \hslash
G$. However, this connection remains an open question, because the microscopic
(trans-Planckian) physics of the quantum vacuum is not known. Here we study
this question using the effective gravity emerging for sound wave quanta
(phonons) in superfluid Bose liquid, such as $^4$He, where the microscopic
physics is known: it is atomic physics. The elements of the effective acoustic
metric are determined by the parameters of this Bose liquid, and as in the AK
theory, the interval $ds$ is dimensionless. One may introduce the effective
""acoustic Planck constants"" as elements of acoustic metric, $g^{\mu\nu}_{\rm
ac}= {\rm diag}(-\hbar_{\rm ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm
ac}^2,\hslash_{\rm ac}^2)$. Then one obtains that the acoustic Planck constant
$\hslash_{\rm ac}$ has dimension of length, and in liquid helium it is on the
order of the interatomic distance in this liquid, $\hslash_{\rm ac} \sim a$.
This supports the scenario in which the Planck constant in the relativistic
quantum vacuum is on the order of the Planck length, $\hslash\sim l_{\rm P}
\sim G$. We also use the acoustic metric for consideration of the possible
dependence of the Planck constant on the Hubble parameter in expanding
Universe.

instance, TPLMs jointly pre-trained with table and text input could be
effective for tasks also with table-text joint input like table question
answering, but it may fail for tasks with only tables or text as input such as
table retrieval. To this end, we propose UTP, an approach that dynamically
supports three types of multi-modal inputs: table-text, table, and text.
Specifically, UTP is pre-trained with two strategies: (1) We first utilize a
universal mask language modeling objective on each kind of input, enforcing the

Regularization (CMCR), which utilizes contrastive learning to encourage the
consistency between table-text cross-modality representations via unsupervised
instance-wise training signals during pre-training. By these means, the

also contain rich information, including room layout, as well as furniture
type, geometry, and placement. High-quality 3D indoor scenes are highly
demanded while it requires expertise and is time-consuming to design
high-quality 3D indoor scenes manually. Existing research only addresses
partial problems: some works learn to generate room layout, and other works
focus on generating detailed structure and geometry of individual furniture
objects. However, these partial steps are related and should be addressed
together for optimal synthesis. We propose SCENEHGN, a hierarchical graph
network for 3D indoor scenes that takes into account the full hierarchy from
the room level to the object level, then finally to the object part level.
Therefore for the first time, our method is able to directly generate plausible

their layout. To address the challenge, we introduce functional regions as
intermediate proxies between the room and object levels to make learning more

integration of numerical models solving the Navier-Stokes equations, which is
computationally complex and time-consuming even on high-end hardware. This is a
notoriously hard problem to solve, which has recently been addressed with
machine learning, in particular graph neural networks (GNN) and variants
trained and evaluated on datasets of static objects in static scenes with fixed
geometry. We attempt to go beyond existing work in complexity and introduce a
new model, method and benchmark. We propose EAGLE, a large-scale dataset of 1.1
million 2D meshes resulting from simulations of unsteady fluid dynamics caused
by a moving flow source interacting with nonlinear scene structure, comprised
of 600 different scenes of three different types. To perform future forecasting
of pressure and velocity on the challenging EAGLE dataset, we introduce a new
mesh transformer. It leverages node clustering, graph pooling and global
attention to learn long-range dependencies between spatially distant data
points without needing a large number of iterations, as existing GNN methods
do. We show that our transformer outperforms state-of-the-art performance on,
both, existing synthetic and real datasets and on EAGLE. Finally, we highlight
that our approach learns to attend to airflow, integrating complex information
in a single iteration.

the representation position within the model manifold. However, for most
machine learning models (in particular neural networks) this representation is
not fixed due to the training pool fluctuations in between active learning
rounds. Therefore, several popular strategies are sensitive to experiment
parameters (e.g. architecture) and do not consider model robustness to
out-of-distribution settings. To alleviate this issue, we propose a grounded
second-order definition of information content and sample importance within the
context of active learning. Specifically, we define importance by how often a
neural network ""forgets"" a sample during training - artifacts of second order
representation shifts. We show that our definition produces highly accurate
importance scores even when the model representations are constrained by the
lack of training data. Motivated by our analysis, we develop Gaussian Switch
Sampling (GauSS). We show that GauSS is setup agnostic and robust to anomalous
distributions with exhaustive experiments on three in-distribution benchmarks,
three out-of-distribution benchmarks, and three different architectures. We
report an improvement of up to 5% when compared against four popular query
strategies.

  using thermoreflectance thermal imaging",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To develop effective thermal management strategies for GaN transistors, it is
essential to accurately predict the device junction temperature. Since the
width of the heat generation in the devices is comparable to phonon mean free
paths of GaN, phonon ballistic transport exists and can significantly affect
the heat transport process, which necessitates a thorough understanding of the
influence of the phonon ballistic effects in GaN transistors. In this paper,
the ballistic-diffusive phonon transport in GaN-on-SiC devices is examined by
measuring the hotspot temperature using the thermoreflectance thermal imaging
TTI combined with the hybrid phonon Monte Carlo-diffusion simulations. A series
of Au heaters are fabricated on the top of the GaN layer to quantitatively
mimic the different heat source distributions during device operation. The
experimental and simulation results show a good consistency and both indicate
that the phonon ballistic effects can significantly increase the hotspot
temperature. With the size of the heat source decreasing, the errors of
Fourier's law-based predictions increase, which emphasizes the necessity to
carefully consider the phonon ballistic transport in device thermal
simulations.

from human-made work, the responsible use of this technology is a growing
concern. Although understanding the benefits and harms of using AI systems
requires more time, their rapid and indiscriminate adoption in practice is a
reality. Currently, we lack a common framework and language to define and
report the responsible use of AI for content generation. Prior work proposed
guidelines for using AI in specific scenarios (e.g., robotics or medicine)
which are not transferable to conducting and reporting scientific research. Our
work makes two contributions: First, we propose a three-dimensional model
consisting of transparency, integrity, and accountability to define the
responsible use of AI. Second, we introduce ``AI Usage Cards'', a standardized
way to report the use of AI in scientific research. Our model and cards allow
users to reflect on key principles of responsible AI usage. They also help the
research community trace, compare, and question various forms of AI usage and
support the development of accepted community norms. The proposed framework and
reporting system aims to promote the ethical and responsible use of AI in
scientific research and provide a standardized approach for reporting AI usage
across different research fields. We also provide a free service to easily
generate AI Usage Cards for scientific work via a questionnaire and export them

Science, access to it is limited. It is thus unsurprising that substantial
research efforts are made to develop methods aiming at mitigating the scarcity

remain limited. On these premises, data curation is becoming a key element of
many SDS research endeavors. Surgical video datasets are demanding to curate
and would benefit from dedicated support tools. In this work, we propose to
summarize surgical videos into storyboards or collages of representative frames
to ease visualization, annotation, and processing. Video summarization is
well-established for natural images. However, state-of-the-art methods
typically rely on models trained on human-made annotations, few methods have
been evaluated on surgical videos, and the availability of software packages

rheological Herschel-Bulkley fluid through a cylindrical tube of variable
cross-section. The concern of this study is to analyze combined pressure-driven
and electroosmotic flow of Herschel-Bulkley fluid. The wall potential is
considered to vary slowly and periodically along the axis of the tube. With
reference to flow in the micro-vessels, the problem has been solved using the
lubrication theory. The Helmholtz-Smoluchowski (HS) slip boundary condition has
been employed in this study. Volumetric flow rate $Q$ is found to be
significantly affected by the yield stress parameter $\nu$ only if an applied
pressure force is active. The linear superposition of flow components
separately due to the hydrodynamic and electric force occurs only for a
strictly uniform tube. This linear relationship fails if non-uniformity appears
in either tube radius or in distribution of the electrokinetic slip boundary
condition. Moreover, converging/diverging nature of the mean tube radius plays
a crucial role on the fluid transport. For the benefit of readers, along with
the original contribution, some applications of external electrical stimulation
(ES) in the human body and HS slip velocity, studied in the past by previous
researchers have been discussed in the paper.

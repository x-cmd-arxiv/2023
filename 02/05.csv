  with Metaball Descriptor based on X-Ray Computed Tomography",,,,,"eess.IV physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The morphology of geological particles is crucial in determining its granular
characteristics and assembly responses. In this paper, Metaball-function based
solutions are proposed for morphological characterization and generation of
three-dimensional realistic particles according to the X-ray Computed
Tomography (XRCT) images. For characterization, we develop a geometric-based
Metaball-Imaging algorithm. This algorithm can capture the main contour of
parental particles with a series of non-overlapping spheres and refine
surface-texture details through gradient search. Four types of particles,
hundreds of samples, are applied for evaluations. The result shows good matches
on key morphological indicators(i.e., volume, surface area, sphericity,
circularity, corey-shape factor, nominal diameter and surface-equivalent-sphere
diameter), confirming its characterization precision. For generation, we
propose the Metaball Variational Autoencoder. Assisted by deep neural networks,
this method can generate 3D particles in Metaball form, while retaining
coessential morphological features with parental particles. Additionally, this
method allows for control over the generated shapes through an arithmetic
pattern, enabling the generation of particles with specific shapes. Two sets of
XRCT images different in sample number and geometric features are chosen as
parental data. On each training set, one thousand particles are generated for
validations. The generation fidelity is demonstrated through comparisons of
morphologies and shape-feature distributions between generated and parental
particles. Examples are also provided to demonstrate controllability on the
generated shapes. With Metaball-based simulations frameworks previously
proposed by the authors, these methods have the potential to provide valuable
insights into the properties and behavior of actual geological particles.

according to their relationships. These objects are not mapped to vectors, and
``similarity'' between objects need be neither numerical nor symmetrical. All
an object needs to do is rank nearby objects by similarity to itself, using a
Comparator which is transitive, but need not be consistent with any metric on
the whole set. Call this a ranking system on $S$. Rank-based linkage is applied
to the $K$-nearest neighbor digraph derived from a ranking system. Computations
occur on a 2-dimensional abstract oriented simplicial complex whose faces are
among the points, edges, and triangles of the line graph of the undirected
$K$-nearest neighbor graph on $S$. In $|S| K^2$ steps it builds an
edge-weighted linkage graph $(S, \mathcal{L}, \sigma)$ where $\sigma(\{x, y\})$
is called the in-sway between objects $x$ and $y$. Take $\mathcal{L}_t$ to be
the links whose in-sway is at least $t$, and partition $S$ into components of
the graph $(S, \mathcal{L}_t)$, for varying $t$. Rank-based linkage is a
functor from a category of out-ordered digraphs to a category of partitioned
sets, with the practical consequence that augmenting the set of objects in a
rank-respectful way gives a fresh clustering which does not ``rip apart`` the
previous one. The same holds for single linkage clustering in the metric space
context, but not for typical optimization-based methods. Open combinatorial
problems are presented in the last section.

group of stars and related their variability characteristics to other stellar

curves with maximum time span and temporal coverage for a sample of 548 Miras.
We determined their pulsation period evolution over a time span of many
decades, searched for changes in the periods, and determined the amplitude of
the period change. We also analysed the Fourier spectra with respect to
possible secondary frequency maxima. The sample was divided into two groups
with respect to the presence of light curve bumps. IR colours and indicators of
the third dredge-up were collected to study the sample stars' mass-loss and
deep mixing properties. Our analysis revealed one new star, T~Lyn, with a
continuously changing period. The group of Miras with meandering period changes
is exclusively made up of M-type stars. The Fourier spectra of the meandering
period Miras have no prominent additional peaks, suggesting that additional
pulsation modes are not the cause of the meandering periods. We confirm that
bumps are more common among S and C Miras and show, for the first time, that
Miras with bumps have lower mass-loss rates than those with regular, symmetric
light curves. Also Miras with meandering period changes have relatively little
mass loss. We conclude that Miras with strongly changing periods or asymmetries
in their light curves have relatively low dust mass-loss rates. Meandering
period changes and light curve asymmetries could be connected to He-shell
flashes and third dredge-up episodes.

training, in which quantized weights frequently jump between two quantized

discover that the learnable scaling factor, a widely-used $\textit{de facto}$
setting in quantization aggravates weight oscillation. In this study, we
investigate the connection between the learnable scaling factor and quantized
weight oscillation and use ViT as a case driver to illustrate the findings and
remedies. In addition, we also found that the interdependence between quantized

ViT vulnerable to oscillation. We, therefore, propose three techniques
accordingly: statistical weight quantization ($\rm StatsQ$) to improve
quantization robustness compared to the prevalent learnable-scale-based method;
confidence-guided annealing ($\rm CGA$) that freezes the weights with
$\textit{high confidence}$ and calms the oscillating weights; and
$\textit{query}$-$\textit{key}$ reparameterization ($\rm QKR$) to resolve the
query-key intertwined oscillation and mitigate the resulting gradient
misestimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these proposed techniques
successfully abate weight oscillation and consistently achieve substantial

atmosphere is used as a calorimeter to measure the energy of extensive air
showers induced by cosmic gamma rays, which brings along a series of
constraints on the precision to which energy can be reconstructed. The presence
of clouds during observations can severely affect Cherenkov light yield,
contributing to the systematic uncertainty in energy scale calibration. To
minimize these systematic uncertainties, a calibration of telescopes is of
great importance. For this purpose, the influence of cloud transmission and
altitude on CTA-N performance degradation was investigated using detailed Monte
Carlo simulations for the case where no action is taken to correct for the
effects of clouds. Variations of instrument response functions in the presence
of clouds are presented. In the presence of clouds with low transmission
($\leq$ 80%) the energy resolution is aggravated by 30% at energies below 1
TeV, and by 10% at higher energies. For higher transmissions, the energy
resolution is worse by less than 10% in the whole energy range. The angular
resolution varies up to 10% depending both on the transmission and altitude of
the cloud. The sensitivity of the array is most severely reduced at lower
energies, even by 60% at 40 GeV, depending on the clouds' properties. A simple
semi-analytical model of sensitivity degradation has been introduced to
summarize the influence of clouds on sensitivity and provide useful scaling

Assuming agents can communicate via a central server, we ask: Does exchanging

question, we provide the first comprehensive finite-time analysis of a
federated temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with linear function
approximation, while accounting for Markovian sampling, heterogeneity in the

analysis crucially relies on several novel ingredients: (i) deriving
perturbation bounds on TD fixed points as a function of the heterogeneity in
the agents' underlying Markov decision processes (MDPs); (ii) introducing a
virtual MDP to closely approximate the dynamics of the federated TD algorithm;
and (iii) using the virtual MDP to make explicit connections to federated

low-heterogeneity regime, exchanging model estimates leads to linear

edges. An orientation of $G$ is formed by orienting all the undirected edges of

is either $(u,v)$ or $(v,u)$. The problem of finding an orientation of a mixed
graph that makes it strongly connected is well understood and can be solved in
linear time. Here we introduce the following orientation problem in mixed
graphs. Given a mixed graph $G$, we wish to compute its maximal sets of
vertices $C_1,C_2,\ldots,C_k$ with the property that by removing any edge $e$
from $G$ (directed or undirected), there is an orientation $R_i$ of
$G\setminus{e}$ such that all vertices in $C_i$ are strongly connected in
$R_i$. We discuss properties of those sets, and we show how to solve this
problem in linear time by reducing it to the computation of the $2$-edge
twinless strongly connected components of a directed graph. A directed graph
$G=(V,E)$ is twinless strongly connected if it contains a strongly connected
spanning subgraph without any pair of antiparallel (or twin) edges. The
twinless strongly connected components (TSCCs) of a directed graph $G$ are its
maximal twinless strongly connected subgraphs. A $2$-edge twinless strongly
connected component (2eTSCC) of $G$ is a maximal subset of vertices $C$ such
that any two vertices $u, v \in C$ are in the same twinless strongly connected
component of $G \setminus e$, for any edge $e$. These concepts are motivated by
several diverse applications, such as the design of road and telecommunication

interpreting measured field electron emission (FE) current-voltage [I(V)]
characteristics. It is commonly assumed that I(V) data interpretation is a
problem in emission physics and related electrostatics. Many experimentalists
then apply Fowler-Nordheim plot methodology, developed in 1929. However, with
modern emitting materials this 90-year-old interpretation methodology often
fails (maybe in nearly 50% of cases), and yields spurious values for
characterization parameters, particularly field enhancement factors. This has
generated an unreliable literature, and validity checks on experimental I(V)
data are nearly always needed before use. A new check, supplementing existing
checks, is described. Twelve different ""system complications"" that, acting
singly or in combinations, can cause validity-check failure are identified. A
top-level path forwards from this unsatisfactory situation is proposed. The
term ""field electron emission system (FE system)"" is defined to include all
aspects of an experimental system that affect the measured I(V)
characteristics. The analysis of FE systems should now be regarded as a
specialized form of electronic/electrical engineering, provisionally called ""FE
Systems Engineering"". In this approach, the I(V) relationship is split: (a) the
current is expressed as a function I(F_C) of the local surface-field magnitude
F_C at some defined emitter surface location ""C""; and (b) the relationship
between F_C and measured voltage V is expressed and determined separately.
Determining I(F_C) is mostly a problem in emission physics; determining the
relationship (F_C)(V) depends on system electrostatics and (for systems failing
a validity check) on other aspects of FE Systems Engineering. The scope of FE
Systems Engineering, and some related research implications and problems, are
outlined.

edges. PubGraph is comprehensive and unifies data from various sources,
including Wikidata, OpenAlex, and Semantic Scholar, using the Wikidata
ontology. Beyond the metadata available from these sources, PubGraph includes
outputs from auxiliary community detection algorithms and large language
models. To further support studies on reasoning over scientific networks, we
create several large-scale benchmarks extracted from PubGraph for the core task
of knowledge graph completion (KGC). These benchmarks present many challenges
for knowledge graph embedding models, including an adversarial community-based
KGC evaluation setting, zero-shot inductive learning, and large-scale learning.

counterpart and has a wide range of applications in computer vision. The
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have performed well in this domain for many
years, and until recently an alternative network architecture, namely
Transformer, has demonstrated even stronger performance. One can attribute its
superiority to the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism, which offers a
larger receptive field and better input content adaptability than CNNs.
However, as MHSA demands high computational costs that grow quadratically with
respect to the input resolution, it becomes impractical for high-resolution
image deblurring tasks. In this work, we propose a unified lightweight CNN
network that features a large effective receptive field (ERF) and demonstrates
comparable or even better performance than Transformers while bearing less
computational costs. Our key design is an efficient CNN block dubbed LaKD,
equipped with a large kernel depth-wise convolution and spatial-channel mixing
structure, attaining comparable or larger ERF than Transformers but with a
smaller parameter scale. Specifically, we achieve +0.17dB / +0.43dB PSNR over
the state-of-the-art Restormer on defocus / motion deblurring benchmark
datasets with 32% fewer parameters and 39% fewer MACs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of our network and the effectiveness of
each module. Furthermore, we propose a compact and intuitive ERFMeter metric
that quantitatively characterizes ERF, and shows a high correlation to the
network performance. We hope this work can inspire the research community to
further explore the pros and cons of CNN and Transformer architectures beyond
image deblurring tasks.

high computational costs and low modeling efficiency in Vertical Federated
Learning (VFL). However, despite its popularity, vanilla splitNN lacks
encryption protection, leaving it vulnerable to privacy leakage issues,
especially Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG). Motivated by the LLG issue
resulting from the use of labels during training, we propose the Generative
Adversarial Federated Model (GAFM), a novel method designed specifically to
enhance label privacy protection by integrating splitNN with Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs). GAFM leverages GANs to indirectly utilize label
information by learning the label distribution rather than relying on explicit
labels, thereby mitigating LLG. GAFM also employs an additional cross-entropy
loss based on the noisy labels to further improve the prediction accuracy. Our
ablation experiment demonstrates that the combination of GAN and the
cross-entropy loss component is necessary to enable GAFM to mitigate LLG
without significantly compromising the model utility. Empirical results on
various datasets show that GAFM achieves a better and more robust trade-off
between model utility and privacy compared to all baselines across multiple
random runs. In addition, we provide experimental justification to substantiate
GAFM's superiority over splitNN, demonstrating that it offers enhanced label
protection through gradient perturbation relative to splitNN.

Decomposition (PID) for multiple variables by defining synergistic, redundant,
and unique information, there is no consensus on how one ought to precisely
define either of these quantities. One aim here is to illustrate how that
ambiguity -- or, more positively, freedom of choice -- may arise. Using the
basic idea that information equals the average reduction in uncertainty when
going from an initial to a final probability distribution, synergistic
information will likewise be defined as a difference between two entropies. One
term is uncontroversial and characterizes ``the whole'' information that source
variables carry jointly about a target variable $\varT$. The other term then is
meant to characterize the information carried by the ``sum of its parts.'' Here
we interpret that concept as needing a suitable probability distribution
aggregated (``pooled'') from multiple marginal distributions (the parts).
Ambiguity arises in the definition of the optimum way to pool two (or more)
probability distributions. Independent of the exact definition of optimum
pooling, the concept of pooling leads to a lattice that differs from the
often-used redundancy-based lattice. One can associate not just a number (an
average entropy) with each node of the lattice, but (pooled) probability
distributions. As an example,one simple and reasonable approach to pooling is
presented, which naturally gives rise to the overlap between different
probability distributions as being a crucial quantity that characterizes both
synergistic and unique information.

enables expressive function approximation for value-based learning and has been
studied extensively. In this work, we instead investigate sample-efficient
learning with density features, i.e., the right matrix, which induce powerful
models for state-occupancy distributions. This setting not only sheds light on
leveraging unsupervised learning in RL, but also enables plug-in solutions for
convex RL. In the offline setting, we propose an algorithm for off-policy
estimation of occupancies that can handle non-exploratory data. Using this as a
subroutine, we further devise an online algorithm that constructs exploratory
data distributions in a level-by-level manner. As a central technical
challenge, the additive error of occupancy estimation is incompatible with the
multiplicative definition of data coverage. In the absence of strong
assumptions like reachability, this incompatibility easily leads to exponential
error blow-up, which we overcome via novel technical tools. Our results also
readily extend to the representation learning setting, when the density
features are unknown and must be learned from an exponentially large candidate
set.

the question of which semilattices arise as the collection of definable sets in
a continuous theory. We show that for any non-trivial finite semilattice $L$

text generation tasks. However, learning complex structures with S2S models
remains challenging as external neural modules and additional lexicons are
often supplemented to predict non-textual outputs. We present a systematic
study of S2S modeling using contained decoding on four core tasks:
part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, constituency and dependency
parsing, to develop efficient exploitation methods costing zero extra
parameters. In particular, 3 lexically diverse linearization schemas and
corresponding constrained decoding methods are designed and evaluated.
Experiments show that although more lexicalized schemas yield longer output
sequences that require heavier training, their sequences being closer to
natural language makes them easier to learn. Moreover, S2S models using our
constrained decoding outperform other S2S approaches using external resources.
Our best models perform better than or comparably to the state-of-the-art for
all 4 tasks, lighting a promise for S2S models to generate non-sequential
structures.

contains hidden information or not. Since JEPG is the most commonly used image
format over social networks, steganalysis in JPEG images is also the most
urgently needed to be explored. However, in order to detect whether secret
information is hidden within JEPG images, the majority of existing algorithms
are designed in conjunction with the popular computer vision related networks,
without considering the key characteristics appeared in image steganalysis. It
is crucial that the steganographic signal, as an extremely weak signal, can be
enhanced during its representation learning process. Motivated by this insight,
in this paper, we introduce a novel representation learning algorithm for JPEG
steganalysis that is mainly consisting of a graph attention learning module and
a feature enhancement module. The graph attention learning module is designed
to avoid global feature loss caused by the local feature learning of
convolutional neural network and reliance on depth stacking to extend the
perceptual domain. The feature enhancement module is applied to prevent the
stacking of convolutional layers from weakening the steganographic information.
In addition, pretraining as a way to initialize the network weights with a
large-scale dataset is utilized to enhance the ability of the network to
extract discriminative features. We advocate pretraining with ALASKA2 for the
model trained with BOSSBase+BOWS2. The experimental results indicate that the
proposed algorithm outperforms previous arts in terms of detection accuracy,
which has verified the superiority and applicability of the proposed work.

effective at quickly optimizing neural networks within the accelerated schemes
category. By revealing the potential interplay between these two types of
algorithms (LR and momentum optimizers or momentum rate (MR) in short), in this

suggest using cyclic learning as the base optimizer and integrating optimal
values of learning rate and momentum rate. We investigated the relationship of
LR and MR under an important problem of medical image segmentation of cardiac

Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that the proposed optimizer achieved
better results (over a 2\% improvement in the dice metric) than other

visualization enhancement applications in computer-assisted surgery (CAS).
Learning-based stereo matching methods are promising to predict accurate
results on laparoscopic images. However, they require a large amount of
training data, and their performance may be degraded due to domain shifts.
  Methods: Maintaining robustness and improving the accuracy of learning-based
methods are still open problems. To overcome the limitations of learning-based
methods, we propose a disparity refinement framework consisting of a local
disparity refinement method and a global disparity refinement method to improve
the results of learning-based stereo matching methods in a cross-domain
setting. Those learning-based stereo matching methods are pre-trained on a
large public dataset of natural images and are tested on two datasets of
laparoscopic images.
  Results: Qualitative and quantitative results suggest that our proposed
disparity framework can effectively refine disparity maps when they are
noise-corrupted on an unseen dataset, without compromising prediction accuracy
when the network can generalize well on an unseen dataset.
  Conclusion: Our proposed disparity refinement framework could work with
learning-based methods to achieve robust and accurate disparity prediction.
Yet, as a large laparoscopic dataset for training learning-based methods does
not exist and the generalization ability of networks remains to be improved,
the incorporation of the proposed disparity refinement framework into existing
networks will contribute to improving their overall accuracy and robustness
associated with depth estimation.

in Ref.[1]. We provide detailed predictions for the visibility and phase of the
Aharonov-Bohm oscillations depending on the number of coupled channels and the

policies for a structurally time-varying factored Markov decision process
(MDP), i.e. the policy's value is estimated with a high-probability confidence
interval. In particular, we begin with a multi-agent MDP controlled by a known
policy but with unknown transition dynamics. One agent is then removed from the
system - i.e. the system experiences node dropout - forming a new MDP of the
remaining agents, with a new state space, action space, and new transition
dynamics. We assume that the effect of removing an agent corresponds to the
marginalization of its factor in the transition dynamics. The reward function
may likewise be marginalized, or it may be entirely redefined for the new
system. Robust policy importance sampling is then used to evaluate candidate
policies for the new system, and estimated values are presented with
probabilistic confidence bounds. This computation is completed with no
observations of the new system, meaning that a safe policy may be found before
dropout occurs. The utility of this approach is demonstrated in simulation and
compared to Monte Carlo simulation of the new system.

their preferred class and then a second, Run-Off election is held between the
top two classes in the first round. Based on this approach, we propose DPA+ROE

the possibility of a merging between the stable chaotic attractor that persists

single/cross-modal contrastive teachers through ensemble distillation, where
the generative student guides the contrastive student. An encoder-decoder style
ReCon-block is proposed that transfers knowledge through cross attention with
stop-gradient, which avoids pretraining over-fitting and pattern difference

analytically show that existing in-processing fair algorithms have fundamental
limits in accuracy and group fairness. We introduce the notion of correlation
shifts, which can explicitly capture the change of the above bias. Second, we
propose a novel pre-processing step that samples the input data to reduce

key benefit of our approach lies in decoupling the roles of pre- and

unfairness mitigation on the processed data via in-processing. Experiments show

operating inside critical environments. However, due to their constrained
nature, novel mechanisms are required to provide external, and non-intrusive
anomaly detection. Among such approaches, one that has gained traction is based
on the analysis of the electromagnetic (EM) signals that get emanated during a
device's operation. However, one of the most neglected challenges of this
approach is the requirement for manually gathering and fingerprinting the
signals that correspond to each execution path of the software/firmware.
Indeed, even simple programs are comprised of hundreds if not thousands of
branches thus, making the fingerprinting stage an extremely time-consuming
process that involves the manual labor of a human specialist. To address this
issue, we propose a framework for generating synthetic EM signals directly from
the machine code. The synthetic signals can be used to train a Machine Learning
based (ML) system for anomaly detection. The main advantage of the proposed
approach is that it completely removes the need for an elaborate and
error-prone fingerprinting stage, thus, dramatically increasing the scalability
of the corresponding protection mechanisms. The experimental evaluations
indicate that our method provides high detection accuracy (above 90% AUC score)
when employed for the detection of injection attacks. Moreover, the proposed
methodology inflicts only a small penalty (-1.3%) in accuracy for the detection
of the injection of as little as four malicious instructions when compared to
the same methods if real signals were to be used.

exploratory data analysis (EDA). EDA is a parametric statistical approach based
on the characteristics of data and is suitable for data-driven investigations.
The distribution style of each dataset was determined, and the important
parameters were found. This enabled us to identify and evaluate the anomalies
in the data. Before the huge 2011 Tohoku earthquake, swarm earthquakes occurred
before the main earthquake at improbable frequencies. The frequency and
magnitude of all earthquakes increased. Both changes made larger earthquakes
more likely to occur: even an M9 earthquake was expected every two years. From
these simple measurements, the EDA succeeded in extracting useful information.
Detecting and evaluating anomalies using this approach for every set of data

part-level attention map, and joint-level attention map, as well as polymerizes
these attention maps in a level-by-level way (i.e., from body level to part

extended Anderson impurity model (e-SIAM) sheds new light on several aspects of
the DMFT phase diagram. For example, the $T=0$ metal-to-insulator quantum phase
transition (QPT) is preceded by an excited state quantum phase transition
(ESQPT) where the local moment eigenstates are emergent in the low-lying
spectrum. Long-ranged fluctuations are observed near both the QPT and ESQPT,
suggesting that they are the origin of the quantum critical scaling observed
recently at high temperatures in DMFT simulations. The $T=0$ gapless

success in computer vision. In recent studies, augmentation-based contrastive
learning methods have been proposed for learning representations that are
invariant or equivariant to pre-defined data augmentation operations. However,
invariant or equivariant features favor only specific downstream tasks
depending on the augmentations chosen. They may result in poor performance when
a downstream task requires the counterpart of those features (e.g., when the
task is to recognize hand-written digits while the model learns to be invariant
to in-plane image rotations rendering it incapable of distinguishing ""9"" from
""6""). This work introduces Contrastive Invariant and Predictive Equivariant
Representation learning (CIPER). CIPER comprises both invariant and equivariant
learning objectives using one shared encoder and two different output heads on
top of the encoder. One output head is a projection head with a
state-of-the-art contrastive objective to encourage invariance to
augmentations. The other is a prediction head estimating the augmentation
parameters, capturing equivariant features. Both heads are discarded after
training and only the encoder is used for downstream tasks. We evaluate our

atmospheric particles as an example, we prove both self preserving and
lognormal distribution patterns are caused by maximum information entropy
principle (MIEP); By deducing thermodynamic entropy (Stent) is a form of Sient,
and building up a particle system approaching a part of the holographic screen,
the information probability statistics of particle number size distribution are
realized on the holographic screen, resulting in the presence of information
entropic force (Fient). Fient drives the system to evolve in the direction of
MIEP. Owing to the initial state, the evolution can undergo an increasing Sient
and enhanced discretization, or a decreasing Sient and weakened discretization.
The latter process corresponds to the system evolution tendency of self
organization; by introducing Fient into the flow field, the field for fluid
system evolution is unified including Fient, Sient, the Newton potential, the
diffusion process, and Navier Stokes equations, indicating that the atmospheric
particle dynamics could be driven by Fient. By numerical simulations of
particle collisions and coagulation based on the Smoluchowski equation, we
prove the evolution of the particle system is indeed information distributing,
inherited from the initial state, measured by information probability,
evaluated by Sient, and driven by Fient. We further prove wave function for

Inspired by the statistical efficiency of naive Bayes, the paper revisits the
classical topic on discriminative vs. generative classifiers. Theoretically,
the paper considers the surrogate loss instead of the zero-one loss in analyses
and generalizes the classical results from binary cases to multiclass ones. We
show that, under mild assumptions, multiclass naive Bayes requires $O(\log n)$
samples to approach its asymptotic error while the corresponding multiclass
logistic regression requires $O(n)$ samples, where $n$ is the feature

independent interests. Simulation results on a mixture of Gaussian validate our
theoretical findings. Experiments on various pre-trained deep vision models

conventional AI models, not LGAIMs. This paper will situate these new
generative models in the current debate on trustworthy AI regulation, and ask
how the law can be tailored to their capabilities. After laying technical
foundations, the legal part of the paper proceeds in four steps, covering (1)
direct regulation, (2) data protection, (3) content moderation, and (4) policy
proposals. It suggests a novel terminology to capture the AI value chain in
LGAIM settings by differentiating between LGAIM developers, deployers,
professional and non-professional users, as well as recipients of LGAIM output.
We tailor regulatory duties to these different actors along the value chain and
suggest strategies to ensure that LGAIMs are trustworthy and deployed for the
benefit of society at large. Rules in the AI Act and other direct regulation
must match the specificities of pre-trained models. The paper argues for three
layers of obligations concerning LGAIMs (minimum standards for all LGAIMs;
high-risk obligations for high-risk use cases; collaborations along the AI
value chain). In general, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk
applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i)
obligations regarding transparency and (ii) risk management. Non-discrimination
provisions (iii) may, however, apply to LGAIM developers. Lastly, (iv) the core
of the DSA content moderation rules should be expanded to cover LGAIMs. This
includes notice and action mechanisms, and trusted flaggers. In all areas,
regulators and lawmakers need to act fast to keep track with the dynamics of

two quantum states, the monotone metric gives the corresponding quantum
$\chi^2$ divergence. We obtain an approximate recovery result in the sense
that, if the quantum $\chi^2$ divergence is approximately preserved by a
quantum channel, then two states can be approximately recovered by the Petz

LExecutor, a learning-guided approach for executing arbitrary code snippets in

otherwise undefined variables and likely return values of calls to otherwise
missing functions. We evaluate the approach on Python code from popular
open-source projects and on code snippets extracted from Stack Overflow. The
neural model predicts realistic values with an accuracy between 80.1% and

approach successfully executes significantly more code than any available

the source plasma. Emission is produced when the plasma enters a state of
energetic excitation which results in deformation of the electron distribution

is believed that the weakly-relativistic electron-cyclotron-maser instability

spectra of all five regions of analysis are best described by composite
three-component models taking into account non-thermal emission, ejecta

Northern limb of the SNR. We find for the shocked ISM a mean electron

even education appears to be significantly affected by the emergence of machine
learning (ML) and in particular deep learning (DL).The main reason for this is
the ability of DL to model complex and unknown relationships between signals
and the tasks of interest. Particularly, supervised DL algorithms have been
fairly successful at recognizing perceptually or semantically useful signal
information in different applications. In all of these, the training process
uses labeled data to learn a mapping function (typically implicitly) from
signals to the desired information (class label or target label). The trained
DL model is then expected to correctly recognize/classify relevant information
in a given test signal. A DL based framework is therefore, in general, very
appealing since the features and characteristics of the required mapping are
learned almost exclusively from the data without resorting to explicit
model/system development. The focus on implicit modeling however also raises
the issue of lack of explainability/interpretability of the resultant DL based
mapping or the black box problem. As a result, explainable ML/DL is an active
research area where the primary goal is to elaborate how the ML/DL model
arrived at a prediction. We however note that despite the efforts, the
commentary on black box problem appears to lack a technical discussion from the
view point of: a) its origin and underlying reasons, and b) its practical
implications on the design and deployment of ML/DL systems. Accordingly, a
reasonable question that can be raised is as follows. Can the traditional
system-centric approach (which places emphasis on explicit system modeling)
provide useful insights into the nature of black box problem, and help develop
more transparent ML/DL systems?

the Zeeman splitting of electrons and holes in a magnetic field up to 10 T.
From the recorded data, the electron and hole Land\'e factors ($g$-factors) are

from source domains, we decouple the input images into Domain Expert Features

implicit use of classification-aware domain variations. Based on the analysis,
we proposed a novel paradigm called Domain Disentanglement Network (DDN) to
disentangle the domain expert features from the source domain images and
aggregate the source domain expert features for representing the target test

aims to find optimal investment strategies and optimal intergenerational
risk-sharing arrangements by minimizing the cost of unstable contribution risk,
the cost of unstable benefit risk and discontinuity risk under the worst-case

modern CTR prediction systems. Conventional algorithms mostly follow two
cascading stages: a simple General Search Unit (GSU) for fast and coarse search
over tens of thousands of long-term behaviors and an Exact Search Unit (ESU)
for effective Target Attention (TA) over the small number of finalists from
GSU. Although efficient, existing algorithms mostly suffer from a crucial
limitation: the \textit{inconsistent} target-behavior relevance metrics between
GSU and ESU. As a result, their GSU usually misses highly relevant behaviors
but retrieves ones considered irrelevant by ESU. In such case, the TA in ESU,
no matter how attention is allocated, mostly deviates from the real user
interests and thus degrades the overall CTR prediction accuracy. To address
such inconsistency, we propose \textbf{TWo-stage Interest Network (TWIN)},
where our Consistency-Preserved GSU (CP-GSU) adopts the identical
target-behavior relevance metric as the TA in ESU, making the two stages twins.
Specifically, to break TA's computational bottleneck and extend it from ESU to
GSU, or namely from behavior length $10^2$ to length $10^4-10^5$, we build a
novel attention mechanism by behavior feature splitting. For the video inherent
features of a behavior, we calculate their linear projection by efficient
pre-computing \& caching strategies. And for the user-item cross features, we
compress each into a one-dimentional bias term in the attention score
calculation to save the computational cost. The consistency between two stages,
together with the effective TA-based relevance metric in CP-GSU, contributes to
significant performance gain in CTR prediction.

The simultaneous recording of transients for applied electric field and induced
polarization gives a comprehensive view on the correlation of electrocaloric
and ferroelectric properties. The technique can further be applied to the
continuous measurement of fatigue for $> 10^6$ electric field cycles.

shape evolution of ice, both of utmost relevance in geophysical and ocean flow
and thus for the climate. To get a better quantitative understanding of the
physical mechanics at play in ice melting in salty water, we numerically
investigate the lateral melting of an ice block in stably stratified saline
water, using a realistic, nonlinear equation of state (EOS). The developing ice
shape from our numerical results shows good agreement with the experiments and
theory from Huppert & Turner (J. Fluid Mech. 100, 367 (1980)). Furthermore, we
find that the melt rate of ice depends non-monotonically on the mean ambient
salinity: It first decreases for increasing salt concentration until a local
minimum is attained, and then increases again. This non-monotonic behavior of
the ice melt rate is due to the competition among salinity-driven buoyancy,
temperature-driven buoyancy, and salinity-induced stratification. We develop a
theoretical model based on the energy balance which gives a prediction of the
salt concentration for which the melt rate is minimal, and is consistent with
our data. Our findings give insight into the interplay between phase
transitions and double-diffusive convective flows.

$O(\sqrt{n})$ possible with the state-of-the-art known schemes. For a given
constrained system, the performance of QCC depends on a new fundamental
parameter of the constrained system - its covering radius. Motivated by QCC, we
study the covering radius of constrained systems in both combinatorial and

holographic superconductor can be constructed using mixed boundary conditions
for the bulk gauge field. By exploiting this prescription, we study the
near-equilibrium collective dynamics in the Higgs phase and reveal the
characteristic features of the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. We show that second
sound disappears from the spectrum and the gauge field acquires a finite energy
gap of the order of the plasma frequency. We observe an overdamped to
underdamped crossover for the Higgs mode which acquires a finite energy gap
below $\approx T_c/2$, with $T_c$ the superconducting critical temperature.
Interestingly, the energy gap of the Higgs mode at low temperature is
significantly smaller than $2\Delta$, with $\Delta$ the superconducting energy

linearizing the geometric incompatibility in our model (in a similar sense to
the additive decomposition of strain being the linearization of the

practices relate conditions only to the reverse process and fit it to the
reversal of unconditional forward process. We find this will limit the
condition modeling and generation in a small time window. In this paper, we
propose a novel and flexible conditional diffusion model by introducing
conditions into the forward process. We utilize extra latent space to allocate
an exclusive diffusion trajectory for each condition based on some shifting
rules, which will disperse condition modeling to all timesteps and improve the
learning capacity of model. We formulate our method, which we call
\textbf{ShiftDDPMs}, and provide a unified point of view on existing related
methods. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on image synthesis
demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of ShiftDDPMs.

users safe online by checking that interventions take place when harmful
behaviour occurs on a platform. ALPACAS infers not only the test input, but
also the oracle, by observing production interventions to prevent harmful

integrity tests for its platforms, such as Facebook and Instagram, which
consist of hundreds of millions of lines of production code. We outline the
design and deployment of ALPACAS, and report results for its coverage, number
of tests produced at each stage of the test inference process, and their pass

end-to-end testing it was applied to. Further, from a pool of 3 million data

on the main physical mechanisms at play in the most extreme environments. Here
we make use of the data from the OmegaWINGS survey, currently the largest
survey of clusters in the local Universe extending beyond 2 virial radii from
the cluster cores, to extend previous analysis outside the virial radius. Local
density and clustercentric distance seems to play different roles for galaxies
of different morphology: the fraction of elliptical galaxies mainly depends on
local density, suggesting that their formation was linked to the primordial
densities, which now correspond to the cluster cores. Only the fraction of low
mass ellipticals shows an anticorrelation with clustercentric distance,
suggesting a different origin for these objects. Excluding elliptical galaxies,
the relative fraction of S0s and spirals instead depends on local density only
far from the cluster cores, while within the virial radius their proportion is
regulated by distance, suggesting that cluster specific processes halt the star
formation and transform Sp galaxies into S0s. This interpretation is supported
by literature results on the kinematical analysis of early and late type
galaxies, according to which fast and slow rotators have distinct dependencies
on halo mass and local density.

in data-parallel training of deep neural networks (DNNs). The recent emergence
of large language models such as GPT has created the need for new approaches to
exploit data-parallelism. Among these, fully-sharded data parallel (FSDP)
training is highly popular, yet it still encounters scalability bottlenecks.
One reason is that applying compression techniques to FSDP is challenging: as
the vast majority of the communication involves the model's weights, direct
compression alters convergence and leads to accuracy loss. We present QSDP, a
variant of FSDP which supports both gradient and weight quantization with
theoretical guarantees, is simple to implement and has essentially no
overheads. To derive QSDP we prove that a natural modification of SGD achieves
convergence even when we only maintain quantized weights, and thus the domain
over which we train consists of quantized points and is, therefore, highly
non-convex. We validate this approach by training GPT-family models with up to
1.3 billion parameters on a multi-node cluster. Experiments show that QSDP
preserves model accuracy, while completely removing the communication
bottlenecks of FSDP, providing end-to-end speedups of up to 2.2x.

colored noises. Two event-generators with an ensured positive minimum
inter-event time for every sample path solution of the stochastic systems, are
proposed for the designs of linear and nonlinear event-triggered extended state
observers, respectively. The mean square and almost sure convergence of the
estimation errors of unmeasured state and stochastic total disturbance
including internal uncertainty and external stochastic noises is presented with
rigorous theoretical proofs. Compared with the linear event-triggered extended
state observer, the theoretical results show that the nonlinear one via
homogeneity possesses higher estimation accuracy but is at the price of higher
triggering frequency. Some numerical simulations are performed to authenticate
the theoretical results.

domains. And a series of aesthetic 2D barcode schemes have been proposed to
improve the visual quality and readability of 2D barcodes for better
integration with marketing materials. Yet we believe that the existing
aesthetic 2D barcode schemes are partially aesthetic because they only beautify
the data area but retain the position detection patterns with the blackwhite
appearance of traditional 2D barcode schemes. Thus, in this paper, we propose
the first overall aesthetic 2D barcode scheme, called OAcode, in which the
position detection pattern is canceled. Its detection process is based on the
pre-designed symmetrical data area of OAcode, whose symmetry could be used as
the calibration signal to restore the perspective transformation in the barcode
scanning process. Moreover, an enhanced demodulation method is proposed to
resist the lens distortion common in the camera-shooting process. The
experimental results illustrate that when 5$\times$5 cm OAcode is captured with
a resolution of 720$\times$1280 pixels, at the screen-camera distance of 10 cm
and the angle less or equal to 25{\deg}, OAcode has 100% detection rate and
99.5% demodulation accuracy. For 10$\times$10 cm OAcode, it could be extracted
by consumer-grade mobile phones at a distance of 90 cm with around 90%
accuracy.

equations with a small parameter e in the perturbed part, which is continuous
and, for $\varepsilon=0$, analytic in zero, are studied. Depending on the
presence or absence of the common factor $\varepsilon$, these classes contain
the system with ""fast"" or ""slow"" time. The unperturbed part of these systems is
generated by the hamiltonian $H=2x^2-x^4+\gamma(2y^2-y^4)$ $(\gamma\in(0,1])$.
The universal method, meaning it can be applied to any hamiltonian, called the
method of the generating tori splitting (GTS method), is developed and applied
to the research of such systems. For arbitrary system of any class, this method
allows to find the sets of the initial values for the solutions of the
corresponding unperturbed system, and for each such set, to provide the
explicit conditions on the system perturbations independent of the parameter.
Any such set, that satisfies the aforementioned conditions, determines the
solution of the unperturbed system, which parametrizes the generating cycle.
The obtained cycle is a generatrix of an invariant cylindrical surface. It is
proven that the system has two-periodic invariant surface, homeomorphic to
torus, if time is factored with the respect to the period, in the small with
the respect to e neighbourhood of this surface. An example of the set of
systems with eleven invariant tori and a perturbation, which average value is a
three-term polynomial of the third degree, is constructed as a demonstration of
the practical use of the GTS method. The GTS method is an universal alternative
to the so-called method of detection functions and the Melnikov function
method, which are used in studies concerning the weakened XVI Hilbert's problem
on the evaluation of a number of limit cycles of autonomous systems with the
hamiltonian unperturbed part.

construction, and in particular, is applicable to compressible material
behavior. Using different sets of invariants as inputs, a hyperelastic
potential is formulated as a convex neural network, thus fulfilling symmetry of
the stress tensor, objectivity, material symmetry, polyconvexity, and
thermodynamic consistency. In addition, a physically sensible stress behavior
of the model is ensured by using analytical growth terms, as well as
normalization terms which ensure the undeformed state to be stress free and
with zero energy. The normalization terms are formulated for both isotropic and
transversely isotropic material behavior and do not violate polyconvexity. By
fulfilling all of these conditions in an exact way, the proposed
physics-augmented model combines a sound mechanical basis with the
extraordinary flexibility that neural networks offer. Thus, it harmonizes the
theory of hyperelasticity developed in the last decades with the up-to-date
techniques of machine learning. Furthermore, the non-negativity of the
hyperelastic potential is numerically verified by sampling the space of
admissible deformations states, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge,
is the only possibility for the considered nonlinear compressible models. The
applicability of the model is demonstrated by calibrating it on data generated
with analytical potentials, which is followed by an application of the model to
finite element simulations. In addition, an adaption of the model to noisy data
is shown and its extrapolation capability is compared to models with reduced

active area of research and development. Most define fairness in simple terms,
where fairness means reducing gaps in performance or outcomes between
demographic groups while preserving as much of the accuracy of the original
system as possible. This oversimplification of equality through fairness
measures is troubling. Many current fairness measures suffer from both fairness
and performance degradation, or ""levelling down,"" where fairness is achieved by
making every group worse off, or by bringing better performing groups down to
the level of the worst off. When fairness can only be achieved by making
everyone worse off in material or relational terms through injuries of stigma,
loss of solidarity, unequal concern, and missed opportunities for substantive
equality, something would appear to have gone wrong in translating the vague
concept of 'fairness' into practice. This paper examines the causes and
prevalence of levelling down across fairML, and explore possible justifications
and criticisms based on philosophical and legal theories of equality and
distributive justice, as well as equality law jurisprudence. We find that
fairML does not currently engage in the type of measurement, reporting, or
analysis necessary to justify levelling down in practice. We propose a first
step towards substantive equality in fairML: ""levelling up"" systems by design
through enforcement of minimum acceptable harm thresholds, or ""minimum rate
constraints,"" as fairness constraints. We likewise propose an alternative
harms-based framework to counter the oversimplified egalitarian framing
currently dominant in the field and push future discussion more towards
substantive equality opportunities and away from strict egalitarianism by
default. N.B. Shortened abstract, see paper for full abstract.

lowest uncertainty in its predictions. These findings suggest that deep

The implementation of deep learning algorithms in cancer pre-screening offer

article, using the particle-in-cell simulation technique, we investigated the
asymmetry generation by a temporally asymmetric waveform (sawtooth-like) in
collisionless CCP discharge. A study by varying the number of harmonics (N)
contained in the sawtooth waveform is performed. The simulation resultspredict
a non-linear increase in the plasma density and ion flux with N i.e., it first
decreases, reaching a minimum value for a critical value of N, and then
increases almost linearly with afurther rise in N. The ionization asymmetry
increases with N, and higher harmonics on the instantaneous sheath position are
observed for higher values of N. These higher harmonics generate multiple
ionization beams that are generated near the expanding sheath edge and are
responsible for an enhanced plasma density for higher values of N. The ion
energy distribution function (IEDF) depicts a bi-modal shape for different
values of N. A strong DC self-bias is observed on the powered electrode, and
its value with respect to the plasma potential decreases with an increase in N
due to which corresponding ion energy on the powered electrode decreases. The
simulation results conclude that by changing the number of harmonics of a
sawtooth-like in collisionless CCP discharges, the ion flux asymmetry is not
generated, whereas sheath symmetry could be significantly affected and
therefore a systematic variation in the ion energy asymmetry is observed. Due
to an increase in the higher harmonic contents in the sawtooth waveform with N,
a transition from broad bi-modal to narrow-shaped IEDFs is found.

as a multi-dimensional array. Estimating covariance from multiway data is a
fundamental statistical task, however, the intrinsic high dimensionality poses
significant statistical and computational challenges. Recently, several
factorized covariance models, paired with estimation algorithms, have been
proposed to circumvent these obstacles. Despite several promising results on
the algorithmic front, it remains under-explored whether and when such a model
is valid. To address this question, we define the notion of Kronecker-separable
multiway covariance, which can be written as a sum of $r$ tensor products of
mode-wise covariances. The question of whether a given covariance can be
represented as a separable multiway covariance is then reduced to an equivalent
question about separability of quantum states. Using this equivalence, it
follows directly that a generic multiway covariance tends to be non-separable
(even if $r \to \infty$), and moreover, finding its best separable
approximation is NP-hard. These observations imply that factorized covariance
models are restrictive and should be used only when there is a compelling

tasks named meta audio concatenation (MAC). It is easy to implement and can be
carried out in extremely low resource environments. Mathematically, we give a
clear description of MAC framework from the perspective of bayesian sampling.
In this framework, we leverage a novel concatenative synthesis text-to-speech
system to boost the low resource ASR task. By the concatenative synthesis
text-to-speech system, we can integrate language pronunciation rules and adjust
the TTS process. Furthermore, we propose a broad notion of meta audio set to
meet the modeling needs of different languages and different scenes when using
the system. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the great effectiveness of
MAC on low resource ASR tasks. For CTC greedy search, CTC prefix, attention,
and attention rescoring decode mode in Cantonese ASR task, Taiwanese ASR task,
and Japanese ASR task the MAC method can reduce the CER by more than 15\%.
Furthermore, in the ASR task, MAC beats wav2vec2 (with fine-tuning) on common
voice datasets of Cantonese and gets really competitive results on common voice
datasets of Taiwanese and Japanese. Among them, it is worth mentioning that we
achieve a \textbf{10.9\%} character error rate (CER) on the common voice
Cantonese ASR task, bringing about \textbf{30\%} relative improvement compared
to the wav2vec2 (with fine-tuning).

Meta-SN, to address these issues. Specifically, instead of computing prototype

the low-dimensional embeddings of prototype vectors. In addition, Meta-SN
presents a novel sampling strategy for constructing meta-tasks, which gives
higher sampling probabilities to hard-to-classify samples. Extensive

additional interactions of bond orbitals (BOs) of C=C bonds of the parent

individual X=C (or C=X) bonds that are proportional to direct interactions of
BOs within respective parent C=C bonds. Thereupon, populations transferred
between first-neighbouring double bonds follow along with parallel and
anti-parallel secondary (induced) dipoles of the latter. These contributions
are determined by an interplay of two indirect interbond interactions of BOs

redundancy by removing similar images within the to-be-annotated subset were
considered as well. We determined the minimum amount of data necessary to
achieve similar performance to the model trained on the full dataset ({\alpha}

initial training dataset is also proposed. Bayesian approximation with dropout
at training and testing showed similar results to that of the full data model
with less than 20% of the training data (p=0.293) compared to random query

setup is used to train the proposed sequential matrix factorization model. One
more ingredient of the proposed approach is a new privacy mechanism that
guarantees the protection of the sent data from the users to the remote server.
To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model we use publicly available

models based on the frequency of app launches. The comparison is conducted in
static and dynamic environments. The static environment evaluates how our model
processes sequential data compared to competitors. Therefore, the standard

emulates the real-world scenario, where users generate new data by running apps
on devices, and evaluates our model in this case. Our experiments show that the

represents, manipulates, and communicates data using long random vectors known
as hypervectors. Among different hardware platforms capable of executing HDC
algorithms, in-memory computing (IMC) has shown promise as it is very efficient
in performing matrix-vector multiplications, which are common in the HDC
algebra. Although HDC architectures based on IMC already exist, how to scale
them remains a key challenge due to collective communication patterns that
these architectures required and that traditional chip-scale networks were not
designed for. To cope with this difficulty, we propose a scale-out HDC
architecture called WHYPE, which uses wireless in-package communication
technology to interconnect a large number of physically distributed IMC cores
that either encode hypervectors or perform multiple similarity searches in
parallel. In this context, the key enabler of WHYPE is the opportunistic use of
the wireless network as a medium for over-the-air computation. WHYPE implements
an optimized source coding that allows receivers to calculate the bit-wise
majority of multiple hypervectors (a useful operation in HDC) being transmitted
concurrently over the wireless channel. By doing so, we achieve a joint
broadcast distribution and computation with a performance and efficiency
unattainable with wired interconnects, which in turn enables massive
parallelization of the architecture. Through evaluations at the on-chip network
and complete architecture levels, we demonstrate that WHYPE can bundle and
distribute hypervectors faster and more efficiently than a hypothetical wired
implementation, and that it scales well to tens of receivers. We show that the
average error rate of the majority computation is low, such that it has
negligible impact on the accuracy of HDC classification tasks.

Specifically, given our insight that objects in ReID share similar geometric

to facilitate geometric features discovery. To condense these features, we
introduce an interpretable attention module, with the core of local maxima
aggregation instead of fully automatic learning, whose mechanism is completely
understandable and whose response map is physically reasonable. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first that perform self-supervised learning to

lots of wrong ideas circulate. This survey aims at showing how all these
uncertainties about cyber can be transformed into manageable risk. After
reviewing the main characteristics of cyber risk, we consider the three layers
of cyber space: hardware, software and psycho-cognitive layer. We ask ourselves
how is this risk different from others, how modelling has been tackled and
needs to evolve, and what are the multi-facetted aspects of cyber risk
management. This wide exploration pictures a science in the making and points
out the questions to be solved for building a resilient society.

  Services",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent days, the proliferation of several existing and new cyber-attacks
pose an axiomatic threat to the stability of financial services. It is hard to
predict the nature of attacks that can trigger a serious financial crisis. The
unprecedented digital transformation to financial services has been accelerated
during the COVID-19 pandemic and it is still ongoing. Attackers are taking
advantage of this transformation and pose a new global threat to financial
stability and integrity. Many large organizations are switching from
centralized finance (CeFi) to decentralized finance (DeFi) because
decentralized finance has many advantages. Blockchain can bring big and
far-reaching effects on the trustworthiness, safety, accessibility,
cost-effectiveness, and openness of the financial sector. The present paper
gives an in-depth look at how blockchain and federated learning (FL) are used
in financial services. It starts with an overview of recent developments in
both use cases. This paper explores and discusses existing financial service
vulnerabilities, potential threats, and consequent risks. So, we explain the
problems that can be fixed in financial services and how blockchain and FL
could help solve them. These problems include data protection, storage
optimization, and making more money in financial services. We looked at many
blockchain-enabled FL methods and came up with some possible solutions that
could be used in financial services to solve several challenges like
cost-effectiveness, automation, and security control. Finally, we point out
some future directions at the end of this study.

"2303.13520","Zhan Zhao","Xiaohan Wang, Zhan Zhao, Hongmou Zhang, Xiaotong Guo, Jinhua Zhao","Quantifying the uneven efficiency benefits of ridesharing market
  integration",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ridesharing is recognized as one of the key pathways to sustainable urban
mobility. With the emergence of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as
Uber and Lyft, the ridesharing market has become increasingly fragmented in
many cities around the world, leading to efficiency loss and increased traffic
congestion. While an integrated ridesharing market (allowing sharing across
TNCs) can improve the overall efficiency, how such benefits may vary across
TNCs based on actual market characteristics is still not well understood. In
this study, we extend a shareability network framework to quantify and explain
the efficiency benefits of ridesharing market integration using available TNC
trip records. Through a case study in Manhattan, New York City, the proposed
framework is applied to analyze a real-world ridesharing market with 3
TNCs$-$Uber, Lyft, and Via. It is estimated that a perfectly integrated market
in Manhattan would improve ridesharing efficiency by 13.3%, or 5% of daily TNC
vehicle hours traveled. Further analysis reveals that (1) the efficiency
improvement is negatively correlated with the overall demand density and
inter-TNC spatiotemporal unevenness (measured by network modularity), (2)
market integration would generate a larger efficiency improvement in a
competitive market, and (3) the TNC with a higher intra-TNC demand
concentration (measured by clustering coefficient) would benefit less from
market integration. As the uneven benefits may deter TNCs from collaboration,
we also illustrate how to quantify each TNC's marginal contribution based on
the Shapley value, which can be used to ensure equitable profit allocation.
These results can help market regulators and business alliances to evaluate and
monitor market efficiency and dynamically adjust their strategies, incentives,
and profit allocation schemes to promote market integration and collaboration.

Using fundamental theorems in real analysis we study the convergence of
well-known impact measures. Findings: We show that pointwise convergence is
maintained by all well-known impact bundles (such as the h-, g-, and R-bundle)
and that the $\mu$-bundle even maintains uniform convergence. Based on these
results, a classification of impact bundles is given. Research limitations: As
for all impact studies, it is just impossible to study all measures in depth.
Practical implications: It is proposed to include convergence properties in the
study of impact measures. Originality: This article is the first to present a
bundle classification based on convergence properties of impact bundles.

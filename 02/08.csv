the aim of supplying continuous power to a small-sized aerial robot. Multiple
features for facilitating the interaction between a tethered micro quadcopter
and a ground base are described in this paper. Firstly, a tether model based on
the catenary curve is presented that describes a quadcopter tethered to a point
in space. Furthermore, a method capable of estimating the tension applied to
the quadcopter, based only on the inertial information from the IMU sensors and
the motor thrusts, is presented. Finally, a novel method for localizing the
quadcopter by exploiting the tension imposed by the tether and the shape of the
tether is described. The proposed methods are evaluated both in simulation and

urgent demand for generating recommendations for a group of users, referred to
as group recommendation task. Existing group recommendation methods usually
infer groups' preferences via aggregating diverse members' interests. Actually,
groups' ultimate choice involves compromises between members, and finally, an
agreement can be reached. However, existing individual information aggregation
lacks a holistic group-level consideration, failing to capture the consensus
information. Besides, their specific aggregation strategies either suffer from
high computational costs or become too coarse-grained to make precise
predictions. To solve the aforementioned limitations, in this paper, we focus
on exploring consensus behind group behavior data. To comprehensively capture
the group consensus, we innovatively design three distinct views which provide
mutually complementary information to enable multi-view learning, including
member-level aggregation, item-level tastes, and group-level inherent
preferences. To integrate and balance the multi-view information, an adaptive
fusion component is further proposed. As to member-level aggregation, different
from existing linear or attentive strategies, we design a novel hypergraph
neural network that allows for efficient hypergraph convolutional operations to
generate expressive member-level aggregation. We evaluate our ConsRec on two
real-world datasets and experimental results show that our model outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. An extensive case study also verifies the
effectiveness of consensus modeling.

non-zero probabilities of misdiagnosis. In this article, we assume the target
population is finite with a fixed number of true cases, and that we apply an
imperfect test with known sensitivity and specificity to a sample of
individuals from the population. In this setting, we propose an enhanced
inferential approach for use in conjunction with sampling-based bias-corrected
prevalence estimation. While ignoring the finite nature of the population can
yield markedly conservative estimates, direct application of a standard finite
population correction (FPC) conversely leads to underestimation of variance. We
uncover a way to leverage the typical FPC indirectly toward valid statistical
inference. In particular, we derive a readily estimable extra variance
component induced by misclassification in this specific but arguably common
diagnostic testing scenario. Our approach yields a standard error estimate that
properly captures the sampling variability of the usual bias-corrected maximum
likelihood estimator of disease prevalence. Finally, we develop an adapted
Bayesian credible interval for the true prevalence that offers improved
frequentist properties (i.e., coverage and width) relative to a Wald-type
confidence interval. We report the simulation results to demonstrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed inferential methods.

from vehicles that have recently passed through that section. This estimate can
help following vehicles. To keep costs down, we depend only on standard
automotive sensors, such as the IMU, and sensors for the steering angle and
wheel speeds. Our system's workflow consists of: (i) processing of measurements
from existing vehicular sensors, to implement a virtual sensor that captures
the effect of low friction on the vehicle, (ii) transmitting short kinematic
summaries from vehicles to a road side unit (RSU), using V2X communication, and
(iii) estimating the friction coefficients, by running a machine learning
regressor at the RSU, on summaries from individual vehicles, and then combining
several such estimates.
  In designing and implementing our system over a road network, we face two key
questions: (i) should each individual road section have a local friction
coefficient regressor, or can we use a global regressor that covers all the
possible road sections? and (ii) how accurate are the resulting regressor
estimates? We test the performance of design variations of our solution, using
simulations on the commercial package Dyna4. We consider a single vehicle type
with varying levels of tyre wear, and a range of road friction coefficients. We
find that: (a) only a marginal loss of accuracy is incurred in using a global
regressor as compared to local regressors, (b) the consensus estimate at the
RSU has a worst case error of about ten percent, if the combination is based on
at least fifty recently passed vehicles, and (c) our regressors have root mean
square (RMS) errors that are less than five percent. The RMS error rate of our
system is half as that of a commercial friction estimation service.

large-scale FPA production has yet to be explored. This paper presents a model
FPA architecture and a cost model for producing it at large-scale. The estimate
of the per-unit-area cost is bounded by a three-tiered approach. The cost model
projects a ""middle"" estimate for FPA production at $89 per square meter.
Estimates for aerial mass density and startup cost are also discussed. This

Abbe's resolution definition alone could not solely characterize the resolving

of utilitarianism and John Rawls. Informally, these two theories of
distributive justice measure the `good' as either a population's sum of
utility, or worst-off outcomes, respectively. We present a parameterized class
of objective functions that interpolates between these two (possibly)
conflicting notions of the `good'. This class is shown to represent a
relaxation of the Rawlsian `veil of ignorance', and its sequence of optimal
solutions converges to both a utilitarian and Rawlsian optimum. Several other
properties of this class are studied, including: 1) a relationship to
regularized optimization, 2) feasibility of consistent estimation, and 3)
algorithmic cost. In several real-world datasets, we compute optimal solutions
and construct the tradeoff between utilitarian and Rawlsian notions of the
`good'. Empirically, we demonstrate that increasing model complexity can
manifest strict improvements to both measures of the `good'. This work suggests
that the proper degree of `fairness' can be informed by a designer's
preferences over the space of induced utilitarian and Rawlsian `good'.

aim at reducing the memory consumption as well as the computation costs, in
order to mitigate the curse of dimensionality as much as possible. As an
example, coupled excitons and phonons modeled in terms of Fr\""{o}hlich-Holstein
type Hamiltonians are studied here. By comparing with semi-analytical results,
we demonstrate the key role of the ranks of tensor-train representations for
quantum state vectors. Typically, an excellent quality of the solutions is
found only when the ranks exceeds a certain value which can be very different
for excitons, phonons, and coupled systems. One class of propagation schemes
builds on splitting the Hamiltonian into two groups of interleaved
nearest-neighbor interactions. In addition to the first order Lie-Trotter and
the second order Strang-Marchuk splitting schemes, we have also implemented the
4-th order Yoshida-Neri and the 8-th order Kahan-Li symplectic compositions.
Especially the latter two are demonstrated to yield very accurate results,
close to machine precision. However, due to the computational costs, currently
their use is restricted to rather short chains. Another class of propagators
involves explicit, time-symmetrized Euler integrators for which we have also
implemented higher order methods. Especially the 4-th order variant is
recommended for quantum simulations of longer chains, even though the high
precision of the splitting schemes cannot be reached. Moreover, the scaling of
the computational effort with the dimensions of the local Hilbert spaces is
much more favorable for the differencing than for the splitting schemes.

symmetry offers an economical solution to the long-standing $g_\mu-2$ anomaly,
confirmed and strengthened by recent measurements at Fermilab. Here, we revisit
the impact of such a $Z'$ on the spectrum of high-energy astrophysical
neutrinos, as measured by the IceCube experiment. This spectrum has been
observed to exhibit a dip-like feature at $E_{\nu} \sim 0.2-1 \, {\rm PeV}$,
which could plausibly arise from the physics of the sources themselves, but
could also be the consequence of high-energy neutrinos resonantly scattering
with the cosmic neutrino background, mediated by a $Z'$ with a mass on the
order of $m_{Z'} \sim 10 \, {\rm MeV}$. In this study, we calculate the impact
of such a $Z'$ on the high-energy neutrino spectrum for a variety of model
parameters and source distributions. For couplings that can resolve the
$g_{\mu}-2$ anomaly, we find that this model could self-consistently produce a
spectral feature that is consistent with IceCube's measurement, in particular
if the neutrinos observed by IceCube predominantly originate from high-redshift
sources.

  non-Hermitian mechanical dimer","15 pages, 9 figures -- added references",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-Hermitian two-site ``dimers'' serve as minimal models in which to explore
the interplay of gain and loss in dynamical systems. In this paper, we
experimentally and theoretically investigate the dynamics of non-Hermitian
dimer models with non-reciprocal hoppings between the two sites. We investigate
two types of non-Hermitian couplings; one is when asymmetric hoppings are
externally introduced, and the other is when the non-reciprocal hoppings depend
on the population imbalance between the two sites, thus introducing the
non-Hermiticity in a dynamical manner. We engineer the models in our synthetic
mechanical set-up comprised of two classical harmonic oscillators coupled by
measurement-based feedback. For fixed non-reciprocal hoppings, we observe that,
when the strength of these hoppings is increased, there is an expected
transition from a $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime, where oscillations in the
population are stable and bounded, to a $\mathcal{PT}$-broken regime, where the
oscillations are unstable and the population grows/decays exponentially.
However, when the non-Hermiticity is dynamically introduced, we also find a
third intermediate regime in which these two behaviors coexist, meaning that we
can tune from stable to unstable population dynamics by simply changing the
initial phase difference between the two sites. As we explain, this behavior
can be understood by theoretically exploring the emergent fixed points of a
related dimer model in which the non-reciprocal hoppings depends on the
normalized population imbalance. Our study opens the way for the future
exploration of non-Hermitian dynamics and exotic lattice models in synthetic
mechanical networks.

the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the downlink
transmission in a wireless network with Rayleigh fading. The novel approach
relies on an approximation mix of exact and mean-field analysis of interference
(dominant interferer-based approximation) to reduce the complexity of analysis
and enhance tractability. In particular, the proposed approximation omits the
need to compute the first or the second moment of the SINR that is used in the
beta approximation typically adopted in the literature but requires of
computing the joint distance distributions. We first derive the proposed
approximation based on a Poisson point process (PPP) network with a standard
path-loss and Rayleigh fading and then illustrate its accuracy and operability
in another four widely used point processes: Poisson bipolar network,
Mat\'{e}rn cluster process (MCP), $K$-tier PPP and Poisson line Cox process
(PLCP). Specifically, we obtain the SINR meta distribution for PLCP networks
for the first time. Even though the proposed approximation looks simple but it
shows good matching in comparison to the popular beta approximation as well as
the Monte-Carlo simulations, which opens the door to adopting this
approximation in more advanced network architectures.

different vapour pressures, the self-assembly of perovskite nanoplatelets is
achieved to enable fine control over the orientation (either face-up or

at the film level, leading to pure-red LEDs exhibiting a high degree of linear
polarisation of 74.4% without any photonic structures. This work unveils the

  Approximate Counting Algorithm","11 pages",,,,"cs.CR cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  DRAM has scaled to achieve low cost per bit and this scaling has decreased
Rowhammer threshold. Thus, DRAM has adopted Target-Row-Refresh (TRR) which
refreshes victim rows that can possibly lose stored data due to neighboring
aggressor rows. Accordingly, prior works focused on TRR algorithm that can
identify the most frequently accessed row, Rowhammer, to detect the victim
rows. TRR algorithm can be implemented in memory controller, yet it can cause
either insufficient or excessive number of TRRs due to lack of information of
Rowhammer threshold and it can also degrade system performance due to
additional command for Rowhammer mitigation. Therefore, this paper focuses on
in-DRAM TRR algorithm.
  In general, counter-based detection algorithms have higher detection accuracy
and scalability compared to probabilistic detection algorithms. However, modern
DRAM extremely limits the number of counters for TRR algorithm. This paper
demonstrates that decoy-rows are the fundamental reason the state-of-the-art
counter-based algorithms cannot properly detect Rowhammer under the area
limitation. Decoy-rows are rows whose number of accesses does not exceed the
number of Rowhammer accesses within an observation period. Thus, decoy-rows
should not replace Rowhammer which are in a count table. Unfortunately, none of
the state-of-the-art counter-based algorithms filter out decoy-rows.
Consequently, decoy-rows replace Rowhammer in a count table and dispossess TRR
opportunities from victim rows. Therefore, this paper proposes `in-DRAM
Stochastic and Approximate Counting (DSAC) algorithm', which leverages
Stochastic Replacement to filter out decoy-rows and Approximate Counting for
low area cost. The key idea is that a replacement occurs if a new row comes in
more than a minimum count row in a count table on average so that decoy-rows

on $\mathbb{R}^d$ are drawn from the same (unknown) distribution, finds
applications in many areas. Its study in high-dimension is the subject of much
attention, especially because the information acquisition processes at work in
the Big Data era often involve various sources, poorly controlled, leading to
datasets possibly exhibiting a strong sampling bias. While classic methods
relying on the computation of a discrepancy measure between the empirical
distributions face the curse of dimensionality, we develop an alternative
approach based on statistical learning and extending rank tests, capable of
detecting small departures from the null assumption in the univariate case when
appropriately designed. Overcoming the lack of natural order on $\mathbb{R}^d$
when $d\geq 2$, it is implemented in two steps. Assigning to each of the
samples a label (positive vs. negative) and dividing them into two parts, a
preorder on $\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by a real-valued scoring function is learned
by means of a bipartite ranking algorithm applied to the first part and a rank
test is applied next to the scores of the remaining observations to detect
possible differences in distribution. Because it learns how to project the data
onto the real line nearly like (any monotone transform of) the likelihood ratio
between the original multivariate distributions would do, the approach is not
much affected by the dimensionality, ignoring ranking model bias issues, and
preserves the advantages of univariate rank tests. Nonasymptotic error bounds
are proved based on recent concentration results for two-sample linear
rank-processes and an experimental study shows that the approach promoted
surpasses alternative methods standing as natural competitors.

simple warping loss to further enforce geometry consistency. Moreover, to
further boost performance in complicated indoor scenes, we also propose a local

demonstrate strong performance in dense mapping, tracking, and novel view

understanding the complex nature of their non-Euclidean structures. Although
diffusion models have achieved notable success in graph generation recently,
they are ill-suited for modeling the structural information of graphs since
learning to denoise the noisy samples does not explicitly capture the graph
topology. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel generative framework
that models the topology of graphs by predicting the destination of the
diffusion process, which is the original graph that has the correct topology
information, as a weighted mean of data. Specifically, we design the generative
process as a mixture of diffusion processes conditioned on the endpoint in the
data distribution, which drives the process toward the predicted destination,
resulting in rapid convergence. We introduce new simulation-free training
objectives for predicting the destination, and further discuss the advantages
of our framework that can explicitly model the graph topology and exploit the
inductive bias of the data. Through extensive experimental validation on
general graph and 2D/3D molecule generation tasks, we show that our method
outperforms previous generative models, generating graphs with correct topology

of nesting function is at $K$ point instead of $M$ point. Two Fermi pockets
with Fe-$d_{xz}$ and Fe-$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$/$d_{xy}$ orbital characters have
large contribution to the Fermi nesting, which evolve significantly with

surface only in a small $k_{z}$ range, and does not play a leading role in

reveal that the Fermi level eigenstates nested by vector $K$ are mainly
distributed from unequal sublattice occupancy, thus the instability at $K$
point is significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, the wave functions nested by
vector $M$ have many ingredients located at the same Fe site, thus the
instability at $M$ point is enhanced. This indicates that the electron
correlation, rather than electron-phonon interaction, plays a key role in the

means being leveraged to diagnose spinal disorders. Traditional manual
diagnostics require a high workload, and diagnostic errors are likely to occur
due to the prolonged work of physicians. In this research, we develop an expert
system based on a hybrid inference algorithm and comprehensive integrated
knowledge for assisting the experts in the fast and high-quality diagnosis of
spinal disorders.
  Methods: First, for each spinal anomaly, the accurate and integrated
knowledge was acquired from related experts and resources. Second, based on
probability distributions and dependencies between symptoms of each anomaly, a
unique numerical value known as certainty effect value was assigned to each
symptom. Third, a new hybrid inference algorithm was designed to obtain
excellent performance, which was an incorporation of the Backward Chaining
Inference and Theory of Uncertainty.
  Results: The proposed expert system was evaluated in two different phases,
real-world samples, and medical records evaluation. Evaluations show that in
terms of real-world samples analysis, the system achieved excellent accuracy.
Application of the system on the sample with anomalies revealed the degree of
severity of disorders and the risk of development of abnormalities in unhealthy
and healthy patients. In the case of medical records analysis, our expert
system proved to have promising performance, which was very close to those of
experts.
  Conclusion: Evaluations suggest that the proposed expert system provides
promising performance, helping specialists to validate the accuracy and
integrity of their diagnosis. It can also serve as an intelligent educational
software for medical students to gain familiarity with spinal disorder
diagnosis process, and related symptoms.

directly breaking its symmetry, but instead by placing elongated ferromagnetic
nanoelement inside the ring, Here, the stray magnetostatic field exerted by the
asymmetrically placed nanoelement determines the movement of the domain walls
upon remagnetization of the nanoring and the resulting chirality in the
remanence. This approach allows the chirality of the vortex state to be
controlled and also promises its control in a dense array of nanorings, thus
suitable for spintronic and magnonic applications.

difficult to understand than the complexity of problems only involving local
constraints. A natural form of global constraints are connectivity constraints.
We study connectivity problems from a fine-grained parameterized perspective.
In a breakthrough, Cygan et al. (TALG 2022) first obtained algorithms with
single-exponential running time c^{tw} n^O(1) for connectivity problems
parameterized by treewidth by introducing the cut-and-count-technique.
Furthermore, the obtained bases c were shown to be optimal under the Strong
Exponential-Time Hypothesis (SETH).
  However, since only sparse graphs may admit small treewidth, we lack
knowledge of the fine-grained complexity of connectivity problems with respect
to dense structure. The most popular graph parameter to measure dense structure
is arguably clique-width, which intuitively measures how easily a graph can be
constructed by repeatedly adding bicliques. Bergougnoux and Kant\'e (TCS 2019)
have shown, using the rank-based approach, that also parameterized by
clique-width many connectivity problems admit single-exponential algorithms.
Unfortunately, the obtained running times are far from optimal under SETH.
  We show how to obtain optimal running times parameterized by clique-width for
two benchmark connectivity problems, namely Connected Vertex Cover and
Connected Dominating Set. These are the first tight results for connectivity
problems with respect to clique-width and these results are obtained by
developing new algorithms based on the cut-and-count-technique and novel lower
bound constructions. Precisely, we show that there exist one-sided error
Monte-Carlo algorithms that given a k-clique-expression solve Connected Vertex
Cover in time 6^k n^O(1), and Connected Dominating Set in time 5^k n^O(1). Both
results are shown to be tight under SETH.

in which the effects of density and viscosity gradients play important roles in
determining flow stability. We perform linear stability calculations for a jet
emerging into an ambient medium of a different viscosity but the same density.
These calculations are intended to isolate the effects of viscosity variation
alone. We conduct a systematic study of the effect of ambient-to-jet viscosity
ratio, jet Reynolds number and the velocity profile specified by the shear
layer thickness, the thickness over which the viscosity change occurs, and
radial shifts in velocity profiles, on the growth of axisymmetric and helical
modes. Additional terms in the disturbance kinetic energy equation that
represent the coupling between the velocity fluctuations and the viscosity
field are shown to be responsible for the additional destabilization. Radial
shifts in velocity profile that represent real effects likely to be encountered
in experiments are shown to be strongly destabilizing. In all cases, the
temporal growth rates of axisymmetric and helical mode are very close, except
at low Reynolds numbers. Spatio-temporal analysis in the complex wavenumber
plane suggests that for sufficiently large ambient viscosity, low-viscosity
jets become absolutely unstable. Over a wide range of parameters, two modes of
absolute instability exist simultaneously, with an axisymmetric mode predicted
to dominate a helical mode. Over a certain narrower space, the helical mode
dominates. The transition boundary for absolute/convective instability is
compared with recent experiments, and the results are found to in reasonable
agreement for the transition of the helical mode, when velocity profiles are
used that correspond to the similarity solution for development of the boundary
layer under a spatially variable viscosity.

increasing relevance in recent years. Current solutions in this area often have
limited scope, such as pick-and-place tasks for a specific object. Thus, each
new process requires a separate toolset, which prevents the realization of more
complex workflows and reduces the acceptance of robotic automation tools. Here,
we present a novel finger system for a parallel gripper for biolaboratory
automation that can handle a wide range of liquid containers. This flexibility
is enabled by developing the fingers as a dual-extrusion 3D print. The coating
with a soft material from the second extruder in one seamless print and the
fingertip design are key features to enhance grasping capabilities. By
employing a passive compliant mechanism that was previously presented in a
finger called ``PaCoMe'', a simple actuation system and a low weight are
maintained. The ability to resist chemicals and high temperatures and the
integration with a tool exchange system make the fingers usable for daily
laboratory use and complex workflows. We present their task suitability in
several experiments showing the wide range of vessels that can be handled as
well as their tolerance against displacements and grasp stability.

Despite it appears to be a linear process, writing conceals many highly
non-linear processes. Previous research has focused on three phases of writing:
planning, translation and transcription, and revision. While research has shown
these are non-linear, they are often treated linearly when measured. Here, we
introduce measures to detect and quantify subcycles of planning (exploration)
and translation (exploitation) during the writing process. We apply these to a
novel dataset that recorded the creation of a text in all its phases, from
early attempts to the finishing touches on a final version. This dataset comes
from a series of writing workshops in which, through innovative versioning
software, we were able to record all the steps in the construction of a text.
More than 60 junior researchers in science wrote a scientific essay intended
for a general readership. We recorded each essay as a writing cloud, defined as
a complex topological structure capturing the history of the essay itself.
Through this unique dataset of writing clouds, we expose a representation of
the writing process that quantifies its complexity and the writer's efforts
throughout the draft and through time. Interestingly, this representation
highlights the phases of ""translation flow"", where authors improve existing
ideas, and exploration, where creative deviations appear as the writer returns
to the planning phase. These turning points between translation and exploration
become rarer as the writing process progresses and the author approaches the
final version. Our results and the new measures introduced have the potential
to foster the discussion about the non-linear nature of writing and support the
development of tools that can support more creative and impactful writing
processes.

emerging topics every day. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables the learner
to incorporate the knowledge of new classes incrementally and build a universal
classifier among all seen classes. Correspondingly, when directly training the
model with new class instances, a fatal problem occurs -- the model tends to
catastrophically forget the characteristics of former ones, and its performance
drastically degrades. There have been numerous efforts to tackle catastrophic
forgetting in the machine learning community. In this paper, we survey
comprehensively recent advances in deep class-incremental learning and
summarize these methods from three aspects, i.e., data-centric, model-centric,

methods in benchmark image classification tasks to find out the characteristics
of different algorithms empirically. Furthermore, we notice that the current

processing, and photonic computing. Despite numerous advances in promoting the
operation speed of silicon modulators, a bandwidth ceiling of 67 GHz emerges in
practices and becomes an obstacle to paving silicon photonics toward Tbps level
data throughput on a single chip. Here, we theoretically propose and
experimentally demonstrate a design strategy for silicon modulators by
employing the slow light effect, which shatters the present bandwidth ceiling
of silicon modulators and pushes its limit beyond 110 GHz in a small footprint.
The proposed silicon modulator is built on a coupled-resonator optical
waveguide (CROW) architecture, in which a set of Bragg gratings are
appropriately cascaded to give rise to a slow light effect. By comprehensively
balancing a series of merits including the group index, photon lifetime,
electrical bandwidth, and losses, we found the modulators can benefit from the
slow light for better modulation efficiency and compact size while remaining
their bandwidth sufficiently high to support ultra-high-speed data
transmission. Consequently, we realize a modulator with an EO bandwidth of 110
GHz in a length of 124 {\mu}m, and demonstrate a data rate beyond 110 Gbps by
applying simple on-off keying modulation for a DSP-free operation. Our work
proves that silicon modulators beyond 110 GHz are feasible, thus shedding light
on the potentials of silicon photonics in ultra-high-bandwidth applications

the public and private sectors, with an average cost of scams of $102m to
financial institutions in 2022. Developing a mechanism for battling financial
crimes is an impending task that requires in-depth collaboration from multiple
institutions, and yet such collaboration imposed significant technical
challenges due to the privacy and security requirements of distributed
financial data. For example, consider the modern payment network systems, which
can generate millions of transactions per day across a large number of global
institutions. Training a detection model of fraudulent transactions requires
not only secured transactions but also the private account activities of those
involved in each transaction from corresponding bank systems. The distributed
nature of both samples and features prevents most existing learning systems
from being directly adopted to handle the data mining task. In this paper, we
collectively address these challenges by proposing a hybrid federated learning
system that offers secure and privacy-aware learning and inference for
financial crime detection. We conduct extensive empirical studies to evaluate
the proposed framework's detection performance and privacy-protection
capability, evaluating its robustness against common malicious attacks of
collaborative learning. We release our source code at

the $SO(3)$ convolutions or tensor products to mathematically equivalent
convolutions in $SO(2)$ . This is accomplished by aligning the node embeddings'
primary axis with the edge vectors, which sparsifies the tensor product and
reduces the computational complexity from $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^3)$, where $L$ is
the degree of the representation. We demonstrate the potential implications of
this improvement by proposing the Equivariant Spherical Channel Network (eSCN),
a graph neural network utilizing our novel approach to equivariant
convolutions, which achieves state-of-the-art results on the large-scale OC-20

Chebyshev expansion. The parametric eigenvalue problem assumes that the matrix

Consequently, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are also functions of $\mu$. We
compute a Taylor approximation of these functions about $\mu_{0}$ by
iteratively computing the Taylor coefficients. The complexity of this approach
is $O(n^{3})$ for all eigenpairs, if the derivatives of $A(\mu)$ at $\mu_{0}$
are given. The Chebyshev expansion works similarly. We first find an initial
approximation iteratively which we then refine with Newton's method. This
second method is more expensive but provides a good approximation over the
whole interval of the expansion instead around a single point.

that the approaches are capable of tracking eigenvalues at intersection points.
Further experiments shed light on the limitations of the Taylor expansion

challenges in FL is the issue of partial participation, which occurs when a
large number of clients are involved in the training process. The traditional
method to address this problem is randomly selecting a subset of clients at
each communication round. In our research, we propose a new technique and
design a novel regularized client participation scheme. Under this scheme, each
client joins the learning process every $R$ communication rounds, which we
refer to as a meta epoch. We have found that this participation scheme leads to
a reduction in the variance caused by client sampling. Combined with the
popular FedAvg algorithm (McMahan et al., 2017), it results in superior rates
under standard assumptions. For instance, the optimization term in our main
convergence bound decreases linearly with the product of the number of
communication rounds and the size of the local dataset of each client, and the
statistical term scales with step size quadratically instead of linearly (the
case for client sampling with replacement), leading to better convergence rate
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T^2}\right)$ compared to
$\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of

of the dynamics of $n^{th}$-order stochastic systems. Our approach builds on
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with generative model classes based on
stable $m$-step stochastic numerical integrators. We introduce different
formulations and training methods for learning models of stochastic dynamics
based on observation of trajectory samples. We develop approaches using
discriminators based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), training protocols
using conditional and marginal distributions, and methods for learning dynamic
responses over different time-scales. We show how our approaches can be used
for modeling physical systems to learn force-laws, damping coefficients, and
noise-related parameters. The adversarial learning approaches provide methods
for obtaining stable generative models for dynamic tasks including long-time
prediction and developing simulations for stochastic systems.

paramount importance for guiding experiments and for analyzing and interpreting
the experimental data, especially for the search of the neutrinoless double
beta decay mode ($0\nu\beta\beta$). However, there are currently still large
differences between the NME values calculated by different methods, hence a
quantification of their uncertainties is very much required. In this paper we
propose a statistical analysis of $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME for the $^{136}Xe$
isotope, based on the interacting shell model, but using three independent
effective Hamiltonians, emphasizing the range of the NMEs' most probable values
and its correlations with observables that can be obtained from the existing
nuclear data. Consequently, we propose a common probability distribution
function for the $0\nu\beta\beta$ NME, which has a range of (1.55 - 2.65) at
90\% confidence level, with a mean value of 1.99 and a standard deviation of
0.37.

computer graphics, which has a wide range of practical applications. Previous
effects achieve great empirical performance based on an encoding-decoding
style. The methods of this style work by first encoding previous motions to
latent representations and then decoding the latent representations into
predicted motions. However, in practice, they are still unsatisfactory due to
several issues, including complicated loss constraints, cumbersome training
processes, and scarce switch of different categories of motions in prediction.
In this paper, to address the above issues, we jump out of the foregoing style
and propose a novel framework from a new perspective. Specifically, our
framework works in a masked completion fashion. In the training stage, we learn
a motion diffusion model that generates motions from random noise. In the
inference stage, with a denoising procedure, we make motion prediction
conditioning on observed motions to output more continuous and controllable
predictions. The proposed framework enjoys promising algorithmic properties,
which only needs one loss in optimization and is trained in an end-to-end
manner. Additionally, it accomplishes the switch of different categories of
motions effectively, which is significant in realistic tasks, e.g., the
animation task. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks confirm the superiority
of the proposed framework. The project page is available at

an informed binary decision by merging together information from several
symmetric agents. Each agent provides the decision maker with a recommendation,
which depends on her information about the hidden state of nature. While the
decision maker has a prior distribution over the hidden state and knows the
marginal distribution of each agent's recommendation, the correlation between
the recommendations is chosen adversarially. The decision maker's goal is to
choose an information aggregation rule that is robustly optimal.
  We prove that for a sufficiently large number of agents, for the three
standard robustness paradigms - minimax, regret and approximation ratio - the
robustly-optimal aggregation rule is identical. Specifically, the optimal
aggregation rule is the random dictator rule, which chooses an agent uniformly
at random and adopts her recommendation. For a small number of agents, this
result no longer holds - the random dictator rule can be suboptimal for
minimizing the regret even for two agents. We further characterize the minimal
regret for any number of agents through the notion of concavification, and
demonstrate how to utilize this characterization in the case of two agents.

  We describe an approach to robustly optimize hard text prompts through
efficient gradient-based optimization. Our approach automatically generates
hard text-based prompts for both text-to-image and text-to-text applications.
In the text-to-image setting, the method creates hard prompts for diffusion
models, allowing API users to easily generate, discover, and mix and match

prerequisite for formulating proportionality axioms in approval-based
participatory budgeting elections. Two common - but very different - ways to
measure the satisfaction of a voter consider (i) the number of approved
projects and (ii) the total cost of approved projects, respectively. In
general, it is difficult to decide which measure of satisfaction best reflects
the voters' true utilities. In this paper, we study proportionality axioms with
respect to large classes of approval-based satisfaction functions. We establish
logical implications among our axioms and related notions from the literature,
and we ask whether outcomes can be achieved that are proportional with respect
to more than one satisfaction function. We show that this is impossible for the
two commonly used satisfaction functions when considering proportionality
notions based on extended justified representation, but achievable for a notion

introduce a strengthening of priceability and show that it is satisfied by

  [2023]",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.GT cs.MA stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a new model, independent linear Markov game, for multi-agent
reinforcement learning with a large state space and a large number of agents.
This is a class of Markov games with independent linear function approximation,
where each agent has its own function approximation for the state-action value
functions that are marginalized by other players' policies. We design new
algorithms for learning the Markov coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) and
Markov correlated equilibria (CE) with sample complexity bounds that only scale
polynomially with each agent's own function class complexity, thus breaking the
curse of multiagents. In contrast, existing works for Markov games with
function approximation have sample complexity bounds scale with the size of the
\emph{joint action space} when specialized to the canonical tabular Markov game
setting, which is exponentially large in the number of agents. Our algorithms
rely on two key technical innovations: (1) utilizing policy replay to tackle
non-stationarity incurred by multiple agents and the use of function
approximation; (2) separating learning Markov equilibria and exploration in the
Markov games, which allows us to use the full-information no-regret learning
oracle instead of the stronger bandit-feedback no-regret learning oracle used
in the tabular setting. Furthermore, we propose an iterative-best-response type
algorithm that can learn pure Markov Nash equilibria in independent linear
Markov potential games. In the tabular case, by adapting the policy replay
mechanism for independent linear Markov games, we propose an algorithm with
$\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity to learn Markov CCE, which
improves the state-of-the-art result $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ in
Daskalakis et al. 2022, where $\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy, and also
significantly improves other problem parameters.

detectors, namely LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, KAGRA, and GEO 600.
These detectors collected data during their third observing run, O3, composed
of three phases: O3a starting in April of 2019 and lasting six months, O3b
starting in November of 2019 and lasting five months, and O3GK starting in
April of 2020 and lasting 2 weeks. In this paper we describe these data and
various other science products that can be freely accessed through the
Gravitational Wave Open Science Center at https://gwosc.org. The main dataset,
consisting of the gravitational-wave strain time series that contains the
astrophysical signals, is released together with supporting data useful for
their analysis and documentation, tutorials, as well as analysis software
packages.

network to study the topological features associated with economic inequality.
The model evolves through two alternating processes, the conservative exchange
of wealth between connected agents and the rewiring of connections, which
depends on the wealth of the agents. The two dynamics are interrelated; from
the dynamics of wealth a complex network emerges and the network in turn
dictates who interacts with whom. We study the time evolution and the economic
and topological asymptotic characteristics of the model for different values of
a social protection factor $f$, which favors the poorest agent in each wealth
transaction. In the case of $f=0$, our results show condensation of wealth and
connections in a few agents, in accordance with the mean field models with
respect to wealth. Low values of $f$ favor agents from the middle and upper
classes, leading to the formation of hubs in the network. As $f$ increases, the
network restriction on exchanges gives rise to an egalitarian society different
from the results outside the midfield network.

PAHs in two different scenarios of PAH processing (or formation): (1) small
PAHs are being destroyed (or equivalently large PAHs are being formed, referred
to as SPR i.e. small PAHs removed), and (2) large PAHs are being destroyed (or
equivalently small PAHs are being formed referred to as LPR i.e. large PAHs
removed). PAH emission was measured considering both the presence or absence of
plateau components. The variation in the PAH band intensities as a function of
the average number of carbon atoms <N$_{C}$> has the highest dynamic range in
the SPR case suggesting that smaller PAHs have higher impact on the PAH band
strengths. The plateaus show overall declining emission with <N$_{C}$>, and
their higher dynamic range in the SPR case also suggests that smaller PAHs are
mainly contributing to the plateau emission. The 7.7/(11.0+11.2) $\mu$m PAH
band ratio presents the least amount of variance with the lowest dynamic range,
rendering this ratio as the better choice for tracing PAH charge. The
3.3/(11.2+11.0) $\mu$m PAH band ratio is the only ratio that has both a
monotonic variance and fully separated values among the SPR and LPR scenarios,
highlighting its efficiency as PAH size tracer but also allowing the
characterization of the dominant scenario of processing or formation in a given
region or source. We present new PAH charge $-$ size diagnostic diagrams, which
can provide insights on the average, maximum, or minimum N$_{C}$ within
astrophysical sources.

first investigated the structural parameters of these clusters, such as the
core radius and the central density, and determined the cluster mass function
(MF) and total mass by interpolating the density profile of each cluster. We
measured the fraction of binaries with a large mass ratio and the fraction of

between the populations of binary stars and BSSs with the main parameters of
the host cluster. {Remarkably, we find that the MFs of 78 analyzed open

of binary stars ranges from $\sim$15\% to more than $\sim$60\% without

Moreover, we detect hints of a correlation between the total fraction of binary

significantly change with the mass of the primary star and the mass ratio. The
radial distribution of binary stars depends on cluster age. The binaries of

Giddings-Strominger wormholes in $N=8$ Euclidean supergravity over a 6-torus to
10d type IIA supergravity and find the solution can be everywhere tuned into
the parametrically controlled supergravity regime. Secondly, we construct
explicit wormholes in AdS spaces and find them again to be under parametric

S^3$ and in type IIB on $T^{1,1}$. The latter has an explicit holographic dual,
and similar to the earlier constructions in $AdS_5 \times S^5/Z_k$, the

redistribute energy and matter throughout galaxies. When young, massive stars
form in spatially clustered environments, they create pockets of expanding gas
termed superbubbles. As these processes play a critical role in shaping galaxy
discs and regulating the baryon cycle, measuring the properties of superbubbles
provides important input for galaxy evolution models. With wide coverage and
high angular resolution ($\sim$50-150 pc) of the PHANGS-ALMA $^{12}$CO (2-1)
survey, we can now resolve and identify a statistically representative number
of superbubbles with molecular gas in nearby galaxies. We identify superbubbles
by requiring spatial correspondence between shells in CO with stellar
populations identified in PHANGS-HST, and combine the properties of the stellar
populations with CO to constrain feedback models and quantify their energetics.
We visually identify 325 cavities across 18 PHANGS-ALMA galaxies, 88 of which
have clear superbubble signatures (unbroken shells, central clusters, kinematic
signatures of expansion). We measure their radii and expansion velocities using
CO to dynamically derive their ages and the mechanical power driving the
bubbles, which we use to compute the expected properties of the parent stellar
populations driving the bubbles. We find consistency between the predicted and
derived stellar ages and masses of the stellar populations if we use a
supernova (SN) model that injects energy with a coupling efficiency of 5-12%,
whereas wind models fail to explain stellar ages we measure. Not only does this
confirm molecular gas accurately traces superbubble properties, but it also
provides key observational constraints for superbubble models. We also find
evidence that the bubbles are sweeping up gas as they expand and speculate that
these sites have the potential to host new generations of stars.

to be stable and linear with exposure time, and are therefore easily corrected
using dark frames. Pixels affected by the Salt \& Pepper noise are $\sim$2% of
the total and a method to correct for this effect is presented. Both cameras
were attached to night telescopes and several on-sky tests were performed to

CR-streaming-mediated heating of the gas. Cooling and CR heating balance near
the base of the wind, but this equilibrium is thermally unstable, leading to a
multiphase wind with large fluctuations in density and temperature. In most of
our simulations, the heating eventually overwhelms cooling, leading to a rapid
increase in temperature and a thermally-driven wind; the exception to this is
in galaxies with the shallowest potentials, which produce nearly isothermal $T
\approx 10^4\,$K winds driven by CR pressure. Many of the time-averaged wind
solutions found here have a remarkable critical point structure, with two
critical points. Scaled to real galaxies, we find mass outflow rates $\dot M$
somewhat larger than the observed star formation rate in low mass galaxies, and
an approximately ""energy-like"" scaling $\dot M \propto v_{\rm esc}^{-2}$. The

In this work, we propose two schemes based on reservoir engineering for
generating Wigner-negative entangled states unconditionally. We consider two
non-interacting mechanical resonators that are radiation-pressure coupled to
either one or two common cavity fields; the optomechanical coupling with the
field(s) features both a linear and quadratic part in the mechanical
displacement and the cavity is driven at multiple frequencies. We show
analytically that both schemes stabilize a Wigner-negative entangled state that
combines the entanglement of a two-mode squeezed vacuum with a cubic
nonlinearity, which we dub cubic-phase entangled (CPE) state. We then perform
extensive numerical simulations to test the robustness of Wigner-negative
entanglement attained by approximate CPE states stabilized in the presence of
thermal decoherence.

quantum criticality, in which fractionally charged excitations condense into a
superfluid, and display novel features that combine quantum criticality and
fractionalization. Nevertheless their experimental realization is challenging.
Here we propose to study the XY* transition in quantum Hall bilayers at filling
  $(\nu_1,\nu_2)=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3})$ where the exciton condensate (EC)
phase plays the role of the superfluid. Supported by exact diagonalization
calculation, we argue that there is a continuous transition between an EC phase
at small bilayer separation to a pair of decoupled fractional quantum Hall
states, at large separation. The transition is driven by condensation of a
fractional exciton, a bound state of Laughlin quasiparticle and quasihole, and
is in the XY* universality class. The fractionalization is manifested by
unusual properties including a large anomalous exponent and fractional
universal conductivity, which can be conveniently measured through inter-layer
tunneling and counter-flow transport, respectively. We also show that the edge
is likely to realize the newly predicted extra-ordinary boundary criticality.
Our work highlights the promise of quantum Hall bilayers as an ideal platform
for exploring exotic bulk and boundary critical behaviors, that are amenable to
immediate experimental exploration in dual-gated bilayer systems.

mass $M>2M_\odot$ have been observed. On the other hand, the existence of
massive white dwarfs (WDs), even violating Chandrasekhar mass-limit, was
inferred from the peak luminosities of type Ia supernovae. Hence, there is a
generic question of the origin of massive compact objects. Here we explore the
existence of massive, magnetized, rotating NSs with soft and steep equation of
states (EoSs) by solving axisymmetric stationary stellar equilibria in general
relativity. For our purpose, we consider the Einstein equation solver for
stellar structure XNS code. Such rotating NSs with magnetic field and rotation
axes misaligned, hence with non-zero obliquity angle, can emit continuous
gravitational waves (GW), which can be detected by upcoming detectors, e.g.,
Einstein Telescope, etc. We discuss the decays of magnetic field, angular
velocity and obliquity angle with time, due to angular momentum extraction by
GW and dipole radiation, which determine the timescales related to the GW
emission. Further, in the Alfv\'en timescale, a differentially rotating,
massive proto-NS rapidly settles into an uniformly rotating, less massive NS
due to magnetic braking and viscosity. These explorations suggest that
detecting massive NSs is challenging and sets a timescale for detection. We
calculate the signal-to-noise ratio of GW emission, which confirms that any
detector cannot detect them immediately, but detectable by Einstein Telescope,
Cosmic Explorer over months of integration time, leading to direct detection of
NSs.

cosmological singularities arise due to energy conditions which are violated by
dark energy, therefore we focus our analysis on non-singular bouncing and
cyclic cosmologies, in particular focusing on the possibility of closed models
always having a bounce for any initial conditions. We analyse the range of
dynamical behaviour admitted by the system, and find a class of closed models
that admit a non-singular bounce, with early- and late-time accelerated
expansion connected by a decelerating phase. In all cases, we find the bouncing
models are only relevant when dark matter and radiation appear at a certain
energy scale, and so require a period such as reheating. We then investigate
imposing an upper bound on the dark matter and radiation, such that their
energy densities cannot become infinite. We find that bounces are always the
general closed model, and a class of models exist with early- and late-time
acceleration, connected by a decelerating phase. We also consider parameter
values for the dark energy component, such that the discrepancy between the
observed value of $\Lambda$ and the theoretical estimates of the contributions
to the effective cosmological constant expected from quantum field theory would
be explained. However, we find that the class of models left does not allow for
an early- and late-time accelerated expansion, connected by a decelerating
period where large-scale structure could form. Nonetheless, our qualitative
analysis serves as a basis for the construction of more realistic models with
realistic quantitative behaviour.

forming region. While there, they can be affected by nearby stars through
external photoevaporation and dynamic truncations. We present simulations that
use the AMUSE framework to couple the Torch model for star cluster formation
from a molecular cloud with a model for the evolution of protoplanetary discs
under these two environmental processes. We compare simulations with and
without extinction of photoevaporation-driving radiation. We find that the
majority of discs in our simulations are considerably shielded from
photoevaporation-driving radiation for at least 0.5 Myr after the formation of
the first massive stars. Radiation shielding increases disc lifetimes by an
order of magnitude and can let a disc retain more solid material for planet
formation. The reduction in external photoevaporation leaves discs larger and
more easily dynamically truncated, although external photoevaporation remains
the dominant mass loss process. Finally, we find that the correlation between
disc mass and projected distance to the most massive nearby star (often
interpreted as a sign of external photoevaporation) can be erased by the
presence of less massive stars that dominate their local radiation field.
Overall, we find that the presence and dynamics of gas in embedded clusters
with massive stars is important for the evolution of protoplanetary discs.

process of a real-time system, especially due to the significance of its impact
on system schedulability. It is well known that, under RMS, the utilization
bound for a harmonic task set is 100%. Also, polynomial-time algorithms have
been developed for response-time analysis of harmonic task sets. In practice,
the largest acceptable value for the period of a task is determined by the
performance and safety requirements of the application. In this paper, we
address the problem of assigning harmonic periods to a task set such that every
task gets assigned an integer period less than or equal to its application
specified upper bound and the task utilization of every task is less than 1. We
focus on integer solutions given the discrete nature of time in real-time
computer systems.
  We first express this problem of assigning harmonic periods to a task set as
a discrete piecewise optimization problem. We then present the 'Discrete
Piecewise Harmonic Search' (DPHS) algorithm that outputs an optimal harmonic
task assignment. We then define conditions for a metric to be rational for
harmonization. We show that commonly used metrics like, the total percentage
error (TPE), total system utilization (TSU), first order error (FOE), and
maximum percentage error (MPE), are rational. We next prove that the DPHS
algorithm finds the optimal feasible assignment, if one exists, for these
rational metrics. We apply the DPHS algorithm to harmonize task sets used in
real-world applications to highlight its benefits. We compare the performance
of the DPHS algorithm against a brute-force search and find that the DPHS
searches up to 94\% fewer task sets than the brute-force search that obtains
the optimal solution.

provides efficient construction methods and storage schemes for the TT format.
Its solvers for eigenvalue problems and linear differential equations are used
in WaveTrain for the time-independent and time-dependent Schroedinger

radiative transfer and dust dynamical modeling we study the radial and vertical
dust distribution. We find that high dust drift rates exceeding 110 M_earth/Myr

bulk of the large dust present in the inner 20 au needs to be vertically
extended, implying high turbulence alpha_z > 10^{-3} and small grains (0.2-1

with the inner dust-rich disk undergoing turbulence triggered by the vertical
shear instability. The conditions in the IM Lup disk imply that giant planet
formation through pebble accretion is only effective outside 20 au. If such an

generators are trained end-to-end on large scale paired image-caption datasets
which are very laborious and expensive to collect. Such models are limited in
terms of their explainability and their applicability across different domains.
To address these limitations, a simple model based on N-Gram graphs which does
not require any end-to-end training on paired image captions is proposed.
Starting with a set of image keywords considered as nodes, the generator is
designed to form a directed graph by connecting these nodes through overlapping
n-grams as found in a given text corpus. The model then infers the caption by
maximising the most probable n-gram sequences from the constructed graph. To
analyse the use and choice of keywords in context of this approach, this study
analysed the generation of image captions based on (a) keywords extracted from
gold standard captions and (b) from automatically detected keywords. Both
quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrated the effectiveness of KENGIC.
The performance achieved is very close to that of current state-of-the-art
image caption generators that are trained in the unpaired setting. The analysis
of this approach could also shed light on the generation process behind current
top performing caption generators trained in the paired setting, and in
addition, provide insights on the limitations of the current most widely used
evaluation metrics in automatic image captioning.

can do better in prioritizing patches. In this study, we evaluate the impact of
combining the syntactic and semantic features on patch prioritization using the
Insertion mutation operators. This study inspects the result of different
combinations of syntactic and semantic features on patch prioritization. As a
pilot study, the approach uses genealogical similarity to measure the semantic
similarity and normalized longest common subsequence, normalized edit distance,
cosine similarity, and Jaccard similarity index to capture the syntactic
similarity. It also considers Anti-Pattern to filter out the incorrect
plausible patches. The combination of both syntactic and semantic similarity
can reduce the search space to a great extent. Also, the approach generates
fixes for the bugs before the incorrect plausible one. We evaluate the
techniques on the IntroClassJava benchmark using Insertion mutation operators
and successfully generate fixes for 6 bugs before the incorrect plausible one.
So, considering the previous study, the approach of combining syntactic and
semantic similarity can able to solve a total number of 25 bugs from the
benchmark, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the highest number of bugs
solved than any other approach. The correctness of the generated fixes are
further checked using the publicly available results of CapGen and thus for the
generated fixes, the approach achieves a precision of 100%

order to determine the field values at the surface of a shape model that
represents a field emitter, it is necessary to define a simulation box and,
within this, a simulation domain. This domain must not be so small that the box
boundaries have an undesirable influence on the predicted field values. A
recent paper discussed the situation of cylindrically symmetric emitter models
that stand on one of a pair of well-separated parallel plates. This geometry
can be simulated by using two-dimensional domains. For a cylindrical simulation
box, formulae have previously been presented that define the minimum domain
dimensions (MDD) (height and radius) needed to evaluate the apex value of the
field enhancement factor for this type of model, with an error-magnitude never
larger than a ""tolerance"" $\epsilon_{\rm{tol}}$. This MDD criterion helps to
avoid inadvertent errors and oversized domains. The present article discusses
(in greater depth than previously) a significant improvement in the MDD method;
this improvement has been called the MDD Extrapolation Technique (MDDET). By
carrying out two simulations with relatively small MDD values, it is possible
to achieve a level of precision comparable with the results of carrying out a
single simulation using a much larger simulation domain. For some simulations,
this could result in significant savings of memory requirements and computing
time. Following a brief restatement of the original MDD method, the MDDET
method is illustrated by applying it to the hemiellipsoid-on-plane (HEP) and
hemisphere-on-cylindrical-post (HCP) emitter shape models.

outward from the wall. In turbulent flows a key contribution arises from
cross-stream ``vorticity cascade'' by nonlinear advection and stretching of
vorticity. We study this process using numerical simulation data of turbulent
channel flow at $Re_\tau=1000$. The net transfer from the wall of fresh
spanwise vorticity created by downstream pressure drop is due to two large
opposing fluxes, one which is ``down-gradient'' or outward from the wall, where
most vorticity concentrates, and the other which is ``up-gradient'' or toward
the wall and acting against strong viscous diffusion in the near-wall region.
We present evidence that the up-gradient transport occurs by a mechanism of
correlated inflow and spanwise vortex stretching that was proposed by
Lighthill. This mechanism is essentially Lagrangian, but we explicate its
relation to the Eulerian anti-symmetric vorticity flux tensor. As evidence for
the mechanism we study (i) statistical correlations of the wall-normal velocity
and of wall-normal flux of spanwise vorticity, (ii) vorticity flux cospectra
that identify eddies involved in nonlinear vorticity transport in the two
opposing directions, and (iii) visualizations of coherent vortex structures
which contribute dominantly to the transport. The ``D-type'' vortices
contributing dominantly to down-gradient transport in the log-layer are found
to be attached, hairpin-type vortices. However, the ``U-type'' vortices
contributing dominantly to up-gradient transport are detached, wall-parallel,
pancake-shaped vortices with strong spanwise vorticity, as expected by
Lighthill's mechanism. We discuss modifications to the attached eddy model and

recurrent instabilities and also exhibits short timescale flickering. By
leveraging the strong predictive abilities of neural networks, we extract some
of the critical temporal dynamics experienced during the mass accretion
including periods of instability. Particularly, we utilize a novel form of the
Echo-State Neural Network (ESN), which has been shown to efficiently deal with

predictions with a low normalized mean square error ($\sim 10^{-5}$ to

This hinders progress in dynamical systems research and limits the shareability

  PyRates is a Python-based software for modeling and analyzing dynamical
systems. It provides a user-friendly interface for defining models, which is
based on a graph-based, hierarchical structure that mirrors the modular
organization of real-world dynamical systems. This design allows users to
leverage the hierarchical structure of their systems and create their models
with minimal effort.
  Importantly, the core of PyRates is a versatile code-generation system, which
can translate user-defined models into ""backend"" implementations in various
languages, including Python, Fortran, and Julia. This allows users to access a
wide range of analysis methods for dynamical systems, eliminating the need for
manual translation between code bases.
  We demonstrate PyRates's capabilities in three use cases, where it generates

and PyTorch code for neural network optimization. Finally, PyRates can be used

computing utilizing a spin-torque oscillator with two free layers is reported.
Conventional spintronics devices usually consist of two ferromagnets, where the
direction of magnetization in one layer, called the free layer, can move while
that of the other, the reference layer, is fixed. Recently, however, devices
with two free layers, where the reference layer is replaced by another free
layer, have been developed for various practical applications. Adding another
free layer drastically changes the dynamical response of the device through the
couplings via the spin-transfer effect and the dipole magnetic field. A
numerical simulation of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and a statistical
analyses of the Lyapunov exponent and the synchronization index reveal the
appearance of an amplitude-modulated oscillation and chaos in the oscillators
with two free layers. Such complex dynamics qualitatively change the
computational capability of physical reservoir computing because the
computational resource is dynamics of the physical system. An evaluation of the
short-term memory capacity clarifies that oscillators with two free layers have
a larger capacity than those of conventional oscillators. An enhancement in
capacity near the edge of echo state property, i.e., the boundary between zero
and finite synchronization index, is also found.

general-purpose skills which aim to reach diverse goals. In particular, offline
GCRL only requires purely pre-collected datasets to perform training tasks
without additional interactions with the environment. Although offline GCRL has
become increasingly prevalent and many previous works have demonstrated its
empirical success, the theoretical understanding of efficient offline GCRL
algorithms is not well established, especially when the state space is huge and
the offline dataset only covers the policy we aim to learn. In this paper, we
propose a novel provably efficient algorithm (the sample complexity is
$\tilde{O}({\rm poly}(1/\epsilon))$ where $\epsilon$ is the desired
suboptimality of the learned policy) with general function approximation. Our
algorithm only requires nearly minimal assumptions of the dataset

Moreover, our algorithm consists of two uninterleaved optimization steps, which
we refer to as $V$-learning and policy learning, and is computationally stable
since it does not involve minimax optimization. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first algorithm with general function approximation and
single-policy concentrability that is both statistically efficient and

optimization on graphs. This operator can be extended to a simplicial complex
$K$ and therefore offers a way to perform ``signal processing"" on
$p$-(co)chains of $K$. Recently, the concept of persistent Laplacian was
proposed and studied for a pair of simplicial complexes $K\hookrightarrow L$
connected by an inclusion relation, further broadening the use of Laplace-based
operators.
  In this paper, we expand the scope of the persistent Laplacian by
generalizing it to a pair of simplicial complexes connected by a simplicial map
$f: K \to L$. Such simplicial map setting arises frequently, e.g., when
relating a coarsened simplicial representation with an original representation,
or the case when the two simplicial complexes are spanned by different point
sets i.e. cases in which it does not hold that $K\subset L$. However, the
simplicial map setting is more challenging than the inclusion setting since the
underlying algebraic structure is more complicated.
  We present a natural generalization of the persistent Laplacian to the
simplicial setting. To shed insight on the structure behind it, as well as to
develop an algorithm to compute it, we exploit the relationship between the
persistent Laplacian and the Schur complement of a matrix. A critical step is
to view the Schur complement as a functorial way of restricting a self-adjoint
PSD operator to a given subspace. As a consequence, we prove that persistent
Betti numbers of a simplicial map can be recovered by persistent Laplacians. We
then propose an algorithm for finding the matrix representations of persistent
Laplacians which in turn yields a new algorithm for computing persistent Betti
numbers of a simplicial map. Finally, we study the persistent Laplacian on
simplicial towers under simplicial maps and establish monotonicity results for
their eigenvalues.

We show that a drawback of other current quantum mechanical and classical
models of triple ionization is that they soften the Coulomb potential of each
electron with the core. The model we employ fully accounts for the singularity
in the Coulomb potentials of a recolliding electron with the core and a bound
electron with the core as well as for the interaction of a recolliding with a
bound electron. Our model treats approximately only the interaction between
bound electrons through the use of effective potentials. These effective
potentials ensure that no artificial autoionization takes place as a result of
the full treatment of the electron-core potential. We demonstrate the accuracy
of our model by obtaining triple ionization distributions of the sum of the
final electron momenta which we find to be in very good agreement with
experiments. Also, we explain the main features of these momenta distributions
in terms of the prevalent pathways of correlated three-electron escape in Ne.
We also show that the different ionization pathways prevailing in

diversity into how fact-checkers use algorithmic recommendations can actively
reduce inequalities in benefits between majority and minority communities.

steady-state diffusion solvers. The construction of such surrogates requires
the selection of an appropriate task, network architecture, training set
structure and size, loss function, and training algorithm hyperparameters. It
is well known that each of these factors can have a significant impact on the
performance of the resultant model. Our approach employs an encoder-decoder CNN
architecture, which we posit is particularly well-suited for this task due to
its ability to effectively transform data, as opposed to merely compressing it.
We systematically evaluate a range of loss functions, hyperparameters, and
training set sizes. Our results indicate that increasing the size of the
training set has a substantial effect on reducing performance fluctuations and
overall error. Additionally, we observe that the performance of the model
exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the training set size. Furthermore, we
investigate the effect on model performance by using different subsets of data
with varying features. Our results highlight the importance of sampling the
configurational space in an optimal manner, as this can have a significant
impact on the performance of the model and the required training time. In
conclusion, our results suggest that training a model with a pre-determined
error performance bound is not a viable approach, as it does not guarantee that
edge cases with errors larger than the bound do not exist. Furthermore, as most
surrogate tasks involve a high dimensional landscape, an ever increasing
training set size is, in principle, needed, however it is not a practical
solution.

automated metrics that often only reveal a portion of their real-world

currently much is unknown about how such models arrive at decisions. To this

is based upon causal inference to enable programming language-oriented

to exploring different model properties, we provide a concrete instantiation

explanations of model behavior in properties of programming languages. To
demonstrate the practical benefit of $do_{code}$, we illustrate the insights
that our framework can provide by performing a case study on two popular deep
learning architectures and nine NCMs. The results of this case study illustrate
that our studied NCMs are sensitive to changes in code syntax and statistically
learn to predict tokens related to blocks of code (e.g., brackets, parenthesis,

rearrangements. Since 1997, quite some biological evidence were found that in
many genomes the reversed regions are usually flanked by a pair of inverted
repeats. This type of reversals are called symmetric reversals, which,
unfortunately, were largely ignored until recently. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of sorting by symmetric reversals, which requires a
series of symmetric reversals to transform one chromosome $A$ into the another
chromosome $B$. The decision problem of sorting by symmetric reversals is
referred to as {\em SSR} (when the input chromosomes $A$ and $B$ are given, we
use {\em SSR(A,B)}) and the corresponding optimization version (i.e., when the
answer for {\em SSR(A,B)} is yes, using the minimum number of symmetric
reversals to convert $A$ to $B$), is referred to as {\em SMSR(A,B)}. The main
results of this paper are summarized as follows, where the input is a pair of
chromosomes $A$ and $B$ with $n$ repeats. (1) We present an $O(n^2)$ time
algorithm to solve the decision problem {\em SSR(A,B)}, i.e., determine whether
a chromosome $A$ can be transformed into $B$ by a series of symmetric
reversals. (2) We design an $O(n^2)$ time algorithm for a special 2-balanced
case of {\em SMSR(A,B)}, where chromosomes $A$ and $B$ both have duplication
number 2 and every repeat appears twice in different orientations in $A$ and
$B$. (3) We show that SMSR is NP-hard even if the duplication number of the
input chromosomes are at most 2, hence showing that the above positive
optimization result is the best possible. As a by-product, we show that the
\emph{minimum Steiner tree} problem on \emph{circle graphs} is NP-hard,

Terrestrial RFI is particularly challenging as the FM radio band spanning over
88-108 MHz lies entirely within the frequency range of the CD/EoR experiments
($\sim 40-200$ MHz). Multiple space-based experiments have been proposed to
operate in the radio-quiet zone on the lunar farside. An intermediate option in
cost and complexity is an experiment operating in space in an orbit around

of RFI in Earth's orbit on the detection of global signal needs to be
quantitatively evaluated. We present STARFIRE -- Simulation of TerrestriAl

provides an expectation of FM seeded RFI at different altitudes over Earth.
Using a limited set of publicly available FM transmitter databases, which can
be extended by the user community, we demonstrate the use of the STARFIRE
framework to generate a three-dimensional spatio-spectral cube of RFI as would
be measured in Earth orbit. Applications of STARFIRE include identifying
minimum RFI orbits around Earth, producing RFI spectra over a particular
location, and generating RFI heatmaps at specific frequencies for a range of
altitudes. STARFIRE can be easily adapted for different frequencies, altitudes,
antenna properties, RFI databases, and combined with astrophysical sky-models.
This can be used to estimate the effect of RFI on the detection of global 21-cm

sub-optimal for another. In this work, we propose a multi-objective decision
making framework that accommodates different user preferences over objectives,
where preferences are learned via policy comparisons. Our model consists of a
Markov decision process with a vector-valued reward function, with each user
having an unknown preference vector that expresses the relative importance of
each objective. The goal is to efficiently compute a near-optimal policy for a
given user. We consider two user feedback models. We first address the case
where a user is provided with two policies and returns their preferred policy
as feedback. We then move to a different user feedback model, where a user is
instead provided with two small weighted sets of representative trajectories
and selects the preferred one. In both cases, we suggest an algorithm that
finds a nearly optimal policy for the user using a small number of comparison
queries.

generating compact and lightweight student models in settings where the amount
of labeled data is limited but one has access to a large pool of unlabeled

``smoothed'' pseudo-labels for the unlabeled dataset which are then used for
training the student model. Despite its success in a wide variety of
applications, a shortcoming of this approach is that the teacher's
pseudo-labels are often noisy, leading to impaired student performance. In this
paper, we present a principled method for semi-supervised knowledge
distillation that we call Student-Label Mixing (SLaM) and we show that it
consistently improves over prior approaches by evaluating it on several
standard benchmarks. Finally, we show that SLaM comes with theoretical
guarantees; along the way we give an algorithm improving the best-known sample
complexity for learning halfspaces with margin under random classification
noise, and provide the first convergence analysis for so-called ``forward

an additional intersection between the medium and hard axis. Furthermore, we
were able to distinguish the effects of different deformation structures - from
single dislocations to tangles to localised deformation and twins - on
different magnetic properties such as on coercivity, remanence and
susceptibility, and we found that our particular grain boundary strongly
reduces the remanence.

solution for brain-wide projectomics. However, because XNH data is typically

performance with a median error of 7.5 cm-1 can be obtained, however, by using

constraints) has been actively applied to solve many problems, such as robust
dimensionality reduction and deep neural networks with orthogonal weights
(Stiefel manifold). Although many optimization algorithms for minimax problems
have been developed in the Euclidean setting, it is difficult to convert them
into Riemannian cases, and algorithms for nonconvex minimax problems with
nonconvex constraints are even rare. On the other hand, to address the big data
challenges, decentralized (serverless) training techniques have recently been
emerging since they can reduce communications overhead and avoid the bottleneck
problem on the server node. Nonetheless, the algorithm for decentralized
Riemannian minimax problems has not been studied. In this paper, we study the
distributed nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem over the
Stiefel manifold and propose both deterministic and stochastic minimax methods.
The Steifel manifold is a non-convex set. The global function is represented as
the finite sum of local functions. For the deterministic setting, we propose
DRGDA and prove that our deterministic method achieves a gradient complexity of
$O( \epsilon^{-2})$ under mild conditions. For the stochastic setting, we
propose DRSGDA and prove that our stochastic method achieves a gradient
complexity of $O(\epsilon^{-4})$. The DRGDA and DRSGDA are the first algorithms
for distributed minimax optimization with nonconvex constraints with exact
convergence. Extensive experimental results on the Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
training over the Stiefel manifold demonstrate the efficiency of our
algorithms.

  note: text overlap with arXiv:2004.06003",,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This dissertation highlights the growing interest in and adoption of machine
learning (ML) approaches for fault detection in modern power grids. Once a
fault has occurred, it must be identified quickly and preventative steps must
be taken to remove or insulate it. As a result, detecting, locating, and
classifying faults early and accurately can improve safety and dependability
while reducing downtime and hardware damage. ML-based solutions and tools to
carry out effective data processing and analysis to aid power system operations
and decision-making are becoming preeminent with better system condition
awareness and data availability. Power transformers, Phase Shift Transformers
or Phase Angle Regulators, and transmission lines are critical components in
power systems, and ensuring their safety is a primary issue. Differential
relays are commonly employed to protect transformers, whereas distance relays
are utilized to protect transmission lines. Magnetizing inrush, overexcitation,
and current transformer saturation make transformer protection a challenge.
Furthermore, non-standard phase shift, series core saturation, low
turn-to-turn, and turn-to-ground fault currents are non-traditional problems
associated with Phase Angle Regulators. Faults during symmetrical power swings
and unstable power swings may cause mal-operation of distance relays and
unintentional and uncontrolled islanding. The distance relays also mal-operate
for transmission lines connected to type-3 wind farms. The conventional
protection techniques would no longer be adequate to address the above
challenges due to limitations in handling and analyzing massive amounts of
data, limited generalizability, incapability to model non-linear systems, etc.
These limitations of differential and distance protection methods bring forward
the motivation of using ML in addressing various protection challenges.

011008 (2021)], whose original purpose was to remove the effects of static
Doppler broadening from an ensemble of non-interacting two-level systems
(qubits). This scheme involves the simultaneous application of red and blue
detuned drives between a qubit level and an auxiliary level, and by carefully
choosing the drive amplitudes and detunings, the drive-induced energy shifts
can exactly compensate the inhomogeneous static Doppler-induced frequency
shifts - effectively removing the inhomogeneous Doppler broadening. We
demonstrate that this scheme is far more powerful and can also protect a single
(or even an ensemble), qubit's energy levels from noise which depends on both
time and space: the same scheme can greatly reduce the effects of dephasing
noise induced by a time-fluctuating environment. As examples we study
protection against two types of non-Markovian environments that appear in many
physical systems: Gaussian noise and non-Gaussian noise - Random Telegraph
Noise. Through numerical simulations we demonstrate the enhancement of the spin
coherence time $T_2^*$, of a qubit in a fluctuating environment by three orders
of magnitude as well as the refocusing of its initially drifting frequency.
This same scheme, using only two drives, can operate on an collection of
qubits, providing temporal and spatial stabilization simultaneously and in
parallel yielding a collection of high quality near-identical qubits which can
be useful for many quantum technologies such as quantum computing and sensing,
with the potential to achieve fault tolerant quantum computation much sooner.

GRBs have shown bumps in the optical light curve that coincide with the
emergence of supernova spectral features, but we do not detect any significant
light curve features in GRB~221009A, nor do we detect any clear sign of
supernova spectral features. Using two well-studied GRB-associated supernovae
(SN~2013dx, $M_{r,max} = -19.54$; SN~2016jca, $M_{r,max} = -19.04$) at a
similar redshift as GRB~221009A ($z=0.151$), we modeled how the emergence of a
supernova would affect the light curve. If we assume the GRB afterglow to decay
at the same rate as the X-ray data, the combination of afterglow and a
supernova component is fainter than the observed GRB brightness. For the case
where we assume the best-fit power law to the optical data as the GRB afterglow
component, a supernova contribution should have created a clear bump in the
light curve, assuming only extinction from the Milky Way. If we assume a higher
extinction of $E(B-V)$=$1.74$ mag (as has been suggested elsewhere), the
supernova contribution would have been hard to detect, with a limit on the
associated supernova of $M_{r,max} \approx-$19.54. We do not observe any clear
supernova features in our spectra, which were taken around the time of expected
maximum light. The lack of a bright supernova associated with GRB~221009A may
indicate that the energy from the explosion is mostly concentrated in the jet,
leaving a lower energy budget available for the supernova.

exploits the volumetric Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) to define filters over
commonly used graph Laplacian which lacks the Riemannian metric information of
3D manifolds. For pooling adaptation, we introduce new objective functions for
localized minimum cuts in the Graclus algorithm based on the LBO. We employ a
piece-wise constant approximation scheme that uses the clustering assignment
matrix to estimate the LBO on sampled meshes after each pooling. Finally,
adapting the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping algorithm for
tetrahedral meshes, we use the obtained heatmaps to visualize discovered
regions-of-interest as biomarkers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
model on cortical tetrahedral meshes from patients with Alzheimer's disease, as
there is scientific evidence showing the correlation of cortical thickness to
neurodegenerative disease progression. Our results show the superiority of our
LBO-based convolution layer and adapted pooling over the conventionally used

treatment protocol, often obscures the causal relationship between treatment
and treatment effect in randomized trials. In the longitudinal setting, the
G-computation algorithm can adjust for confounding to estimate causal effects.
Typically, G-computation assumes that both 1) compliance is observed; and 2)
the densities of the confounders can be correctly specified. We aim to develop
a G-computation estimator in the setting where both assumptions are violated.
For 1), in place of unobserved compliance, we substitute in probability weights
derived from modeling a biomarker associated with compliance. For 2), we fit
semiparametric models using predictive mean matching. Specifically, we
parametrically specify only the conditional mean of the confounders, and then
use predictive mean matching to randomly generate confounder data for
G-computation. In both the simulation and application, we compare multiple
causal estimators already established in the literature with those derived from
our method. For the simulation, we generated data across different sample sizes

closes the excitation gap due to the magnetic anisotropy, inducing a transition
from the N\'eel ordered state to an incommensurate longitudinal spin density
wave phase. If the field is increased further, another transition into a
transverse antiferromagnetic phase takes place at 9 T due to the competition
between longitudinal and transverse correlations. We numerically and
experimentally show that the model of XXZ chains connected by a weak interchain
interaction well reproduces this transition. We also calculate the dynamical
susceptibility and demonstrate that it agrees quantitatively with inelastic
neutron scattering measurements. In contrast to the abrupt change of magnetic
ordering, the spectra do not change much at the transition at 9 T, and the spin
dynamics can be described as a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. We also refine the
modeling of BaCo$_{2}$V$_{2}$O$_{8}$ by including a four-site periodic term

the magnetic susceptibility appearing at 19 T as well as for the anticrossing

in this paper to deal with various signal processing attacks (e.g. median

(e.g. rotation, scaling and cropping). A feature detector is used to select
local areas for embedding. Then stationary wavelet transform (SWT) is applied
on each local area for denoising by setting the corresponding diagonal
coefficients to zero. With the implementation of histogram shifting, the
watermark is embedded into denoised local areas. Meanwhile, a secret key is
used in the embedding process which ensures the security that the watermark
cannot be easily hacked. After the embedding process, the SWT diagonal
coefficients are used to reconstruct the watermarked image. With the proposed
watermarking method, we can achieve higher image quality and less bit error
rate (BER) in the decoding process even after some attacks. Compared with
global watermarking methods, the proposed watermarking scheme based on local

difficult to resolve modes close in the energy, such as coupled modes of dimer
antennas. Here we address this issue for a case study of the dimer plasmonic
antenna composed of two gold discs. We analyze four nearly degenerate coupled
plasmon modes of the dimer: longitudinal and transverse bonding and antibonding
dipole modes. With a traditional approach, which takes into account the
spectral response of the antennas recorded at specific points, the modes cannot
be experimentally identified with EELS. Therefore, we employ the spectral and
spatial sensitivity of EELS simultaneously. We propose several metrics that can
be utilized to resolve the modes. First, we utilize electrodynamic simulations
to verify that the metrics indeed represent the spectral positions of the
plasmon modes. Next, we apply the metrics to experimental data, demonstrating
their ability to resolve three of the above-mentioned modes (with transverse
bonding and antibonding modes still unresolved), identify them unequivocally,

phase diagram of Li. Here, we report on an extensive exploration of the energy
landscape of Li using an advanced crystal structure search method combined with
a machine learning approach, which greatly expands the scale of structure
search, leading to the prediction of four complex Li crystal phases containing
up to 192 atoms in the unit cell that are energetically competitive with known
Li structures. These findings provide a viable solution to the newly observed
yet unidentified crystalline phases of Li, and showcase the predictive power of
the global structure search method for discovering complex crystal structures
in conjunction with accurate machine-learning potentials.

learning model development, but our common practice is archaic -- primarily
using a manual or grid search. This is partly because adopting an advanced HPO
algorithm entails extra complexity to workflow and longer computation time.
This imposes a significant hurdle to machine learning (ML) applications since
the choice of suboptimal hyperparameters limits the performance of ML models,
ultimately failing to harness the full potential of ML techniques. In this
article, we present a two-step HPO method as a strategy to minimize compute and
wait time as a lesson learned during applied ML parameterization work. A
preliminary evaluation of hyperparameters is first conducted on a small subset
of a training dataset, then top-performing candidate models are re-evaluated
after retraining with an entire training dataset. This two-step HPO method can
be applied to any HPO search algorithm, and we argue it has attractive
efficiencies. As a case study, we present our recent application of the
two-step HPO method to the development of neural network emulators of aerosol
activation. Using only 5% of a training dataset in the initial step is
sufficient to find optimal hyperparameter configurations from much more
extensive sampling. The benefits of HPO are then revealed by analysis of
hyperparameters and model performance, revealing a minimal model complexity
required to achieve the best performance, and the diversity of top-performing
models harvested from the HPO process allows us to choose a high-performing
model with a low inference cost for efficient use in GCMs.

experiment with prompt-based learning on the PERSONAGE restaurant

text for 5 different Big-5 personality types: agreeable, disagreeable,
conscientious, unconscientious, and extravert. We test two different classes of
discrete prompts to generate utterances for a particular personality style: (1)
prompts that demonstrate generating directly from a meaning representation that
includes a personality specification; and (2) prompts that rely on first
converting the meaning representation to a textual pseudo-reference, and then
using the pseudo-reference in a textual style transfer (TST) prompt. In each
case, we show that we can vastly improve performance by over-generating outputs
and ranking them, testing several ranking functions based on automatic metrics
for semantic accuracy, personality-match, and fluency. We also test whether NLG
personality demonstrations from the restaurant domain can be used with meaning
representations for the video game domain to generate personality stylized
utterances about video games. Our findings show that the TST prompts produces
the highest semantic accuracy (78.46% for restaurants and 87.6% for video

Our results on transferring personality style to video game utterances are
surprisingly good. To our knowledge, there is no previous work testing the

challenging as the dataflow graph varies per input instance. As a result,
state-of-the-art frameworks use heuristics that result in suboptimal batching

Zr-substituted hafnia, i.e., $\mathrm{Hf_{1-x}Zr_xO_2}$ (HZO). The extent of Zr
substitution can be great, and x is commonly set to 0.5. However, the band gap
of $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ is lower than $\mathrm{HfO_2}$, thus it is uncertain how
the Zr content should influence the electronic band structure of HZO. A reduced
band gap is detrimental to the cycling endurance as charge injection and
dielectric breakdown would become easier. Another issue is regarding the
comparison on the band gaps between $\mathrm{HfO_2}$/$\mathrm{ZrO_2}$
superlattices and HZO solid-state solutions. In this work we systematically
investigated the electronic structures of $\mathrm{HfO_2}$, $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$
and HZO using self-energy corrected density functional theory. In particular,
the conduction band minimum of $Pca2_1$-$\mathrm{HfO_2}$ is found to lie at an
ordinary k-point on the Brillouin zone border, not related to any interlines
between high-symmetry k-points. Moreover, the rule of HZO band gap variation

exponential reduction regime and linear decay regime have been revealed. The
band gaps of $\mathrm{HfO_2}$/$\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ ferroelectric superlattices are
investigated in a systematic manner, and the reason why the superlattice could
possess a band gap lower than that of $\mathrm{ZrO_2}$ is revealed through

explicitly partition the game form into piece forms, each of which starts at a
(Selten) subroot and contains all subsequent nodes except those that follow a
subsequent subroot. Then the set of subroots becomes the domain of a value
function, and the piece-form partition becomes the framework for a value
recursion which generalizes the Bellman equation from dynamic programming. The
main results connect the value recursion with the subgame-perfect equilibria of
the original game, under the assumptions of upper- and lower-convergence.
Finally, a corollary characterizes subgame perfection as the absence of an

this paper proposes a robustness-aware coreset selection (RCS) method. RCS does

of submodular maximization, of which the greedy search is an efficient solution
with an optimality guarantee for the original problem. Empirically, our
comprehensive results corroborate that RCS can speed up ACL by a large margin
without significantly hurting the robustness transferability. Notably, to the

good read performance, are found to be promising candidates for deploying DNNs.
However, despite the promise, emerging NVMs often suffer from reliability
issues such as stuck-at faults, which decrease the chip yield/memory lifetime
and severely impact the accuracy of DNNs. A stuck-at cell can be read but not
reprogrammed, thus, stuck-at faults in NVMs may or may not result in errors
depending on the data to be stored. By reducing the number of errors caused by
stuck-at faults, the reliability of a DNN-based system can be enhanced. This
paper proposes CRAFT, i.e., Criticality-Aware Fault-Tolerance Enhancement
Techniques to enhance the reliability of NVM-based DNNs in the presence of
stuck-at faults. A data block remapping technique is used to reduce the impact
of stuck-at faults on DNNs accuracy. Additionally, by performing bit-level
criticality analysis on various DNNs, the critical-bit positions in network
parameters that can significantly impact the accuracy are identified. Based on
this analysis, we propose an encoding method which effectively swaps the
critical bit positions with that of non-critical bits when more errors (due to
stuck-at faults) are present in the critical bits.

iron specially suited to shield against gamma rays from $^{124}$Sb decays while
letting through the neutrons. To increase the $^{124}$Sb activity and thus the
neutron flux, a $>$1 GBq $^{124}$Sb source was produced by irradiating a
natural Sb metal pellet with a high flux of thermal neutrons in a nuclear
reactor. The design of the source shielding structure makes for easy
transportation and deployment. A hydrogen gas proportional counter is used to
characterize the neutrons emitted by the source and a NaI detector is used for
gamma background characterization. At the exit opening of the neutron beam, the
characterization determined the neutron flux in the energy range 20-25 keV to
be 5.36$\pm$0.20 neutrons per cm$^2$ per second and the total gamma flux to be
213$\pm$6 gammas per cm$^2$ per second (numbers scaled to 1 GBq activity of the

sensitive to neutrons with incident kinetic energies from 8 to 17 keV, so it

along the Galactic midplane, (2) the layer in the Gould Belt, and (3) the layer
passing through the Cepheus and Chamaeleon dust cloud complexes. In each layer
the dust density decreases exponentially with increasing distance from the
midplane of the layer. In addition, there are sinusoidal longitudinal
extinction variations along the midplane of each layer. We have found the most
probable values of 29 parameters of our model using four data sets: the 3D
stellar reddening maps by Gontcharov (2017), Lallement et al. (2019), and Green
et al. (2019) and the extinctions inferred by Anders et al. (2022) for 993291
giants from the Gaia EDR3. All of the data give similar estimates of the model
parameters. The extinction for a star or a point in space is predicted by our
model with an accuracy from $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V})=0.07$ to 0.37 for high and
low Galactic latitudes, respectively. The natural fluctuations of the dust
medium dominate in these values. When ignoring the fluctuations of the medium,
the average extinction for an extended object (a galaxy, a star cluster, a dust
cloud) or a small region of space is predicted by our model with an accuracy
from $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V})=0.04$ to 0.15 for high and low Galactic latitudes,
respectively. Green et al. (2019) and Anders et al. (2022) give in unison an
estimate of $A_\mathrm{V}=0.12^m$ for the extinction at high latitudes across
the whole Galactic dust half-layer above or below the Sun with the natural
fluctuations of the medium $\sigma(A_\mathrm{V})=0.06^m$. Our model is a step
to explain how a substantial amount of dust ended up far from the Galactic
midplane.

macroscopic force between Earth and Sun if Earth is treated as a polarized
source. There are about $10^{42}$ number of polarized electrons in Earth due to
the presence of the geomagnetic field. The monopole-dipole interactions between
electrons in Earth and nucleons in Sun can influence the perihelion precession
of Earth, gravitational light bending and Shapiro time delay. The contribution
of monopole-dipole potential is limited to be no larger than the measurement
uncertainty. We obtain the first bound on monopole-dipole strength from single
astrophysical observations. The perihelion precession of Earth puts the
stronger bound on monopole-dipole coupling strength as $g_Sg_P\lesssim
1.75\times 10^{-16}$ for the ALP of mass $m_a\lesssim 1.35\times
10^{-18}~\rm{eV}$. We also obtain constraints on monopole-dipole coupling
strength as $g_Sg_P\lesssim 5.61\times 10^{-38}$ from two different
astrophysical observations such as the perihelion precession of the planet and
the red giant branch. The bound is three orders of magnitude stronger than the

critical review has been done of the various interventions used in the

fidelity is essential for many quantum algorithms. We introduce the Fourier
Series Loader (FSL) method for preparing quantum states that exactly encode
multi-dimensional Fourier series using linear-depth quantum circuits. The FSL
method prepares a ($Dn$)-qubit state encoding the $2^{Dn}$-point uniform
discretization of a $D$-dimensional function specified by a $D$-dimensional
Fourier series. A free parameter $m < n$ determines the number of Fourier
coefficients, $2^{D(m+1)}$, used to represent the function. The FSL method uses
a quantum circuit of depth at most $2(n-2)+\lceil \log_{2}(n-m) \rceil +
2^{D(m+1)+2} -2D(m+1)$, which is linear in the number of Fourier coefficients,
and linear in the number of qubits ($Dn$) despite the fact that the loaded
function's discretization is over exponentially many ($2^{Dn}$) points. We
present a classical compilation algorithm with runtime $O(2^{3D(m+1)})$ to
determine the FSL circuit for a given Fourier series. The FSL method allows for
the highly accurate loading of complex-valued functions that are
well-approximated by a Fourier series with finitely many terms. We report
results from noiseless quantum circuit simulations, illustrating the capability
of the FSL method to load various continuous 1D functions, and a discontinuous
1D function, on 20 qubits with infidelities of less than $10^{-6}$ and
$10^{-3}$, respectively. We also demonstrate the practicality of the FSL method
for near-term quantum computers by presenting experiments performed on the
Quantinuum H$1$-$1$ and H$1$-$2$ trapped-ion quantum computers: we loaded a
complex-valued function on 3 qubits with a fidelity of over $95\%$, as well as
various 1D real-valued functions on up to 6 qubits with classical fidelities
$\approx 99\%$, and a 2D function on 10 qubits with a classical fidelity

we report that the photoluminescence (PL) of single-layer WS$_2$ is
substantially affected by interfacial water that is inevitably present between
itself and supporting mica substrates. Using PL spectroscopy and wide-field
imaging, we show that the emission signals from A excitons and their negative
trions decreased at distinctively different rates with increasing excitation
power, which can be attributed to the more efficient annihilation between
excitons than trions. By gas-controlled PL imaging, we also prove that
interfacial water converts trions into excitons by depleting native negative
charges through an oxygen reduction reaction, which renders excited WS$_2$ more
susceptible to nonradiative decay via exciton-exciton annihilation.
Understanding the roles of nanoscopic water in complex low-dimensional

MIMO spatial multiplexing gain can be hardly attained in VLC channels due to
their strong spatial correlation. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
deploying the optical intelligent reflecting surface (OIRS) in the environment
to boost the capacity of MIMO VLC. Firstly, based on the extremely near-field
channel condition in VLC, we propose a new channel model for OIRS-assisted MIMO
VLC and reveal its peculiar ``no crosstalk'' property, where the OIRS
reflecting elements can be respectively configured to align with one pair of
transmitter and receiver antennas without causing crosstalk to each other.
Next, we characterize the OIRS-assisted MIMO VLC capacities under different
practical power constraints and then proceed to maximize them by jointly
optimizing the OIRS element alignment and transmitter emission power. In
particular, for optimizing the OIRS element alignment, we propose two
algorithms, namely, location-aided interior-point algorithm and log-det-based
alternating optimization algorithm, to balance the performance versus
complexity trade-off; while the optimal transmitter emission power is derived
in closed form. Numerical results are provided, which validate the capacity
improvement of OIRS-assisted MIMO VLC against the VLC without OIRS and
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithms compared to

EvoText employs two models: $G$, a text generation model, and $D$, a model that

fine-tuned $D$ model serves as the knowledge base. The text generated by $G$ is
then input to $D$ to determine whether it is legitimate. Finally, $G$ is
fine-tuned based on $D$'s output. EvoText enables the model to learn up-to-date
knowledge through a self-escalation process that builds on a priori knowledge.
When EvoText needs to learn something new, it simply fine-tunes the $D$ model.

Spectral intervals within which stellar lines are contaminated by telluric

potential improvement of telluric absorption removal and subsequent extension
of the useful spectral domain on the precision of radial velocity measurements.
We developed a correction method based on the on-line web service TAPAS,
allowing to determine a synthetic atmospheric transmission spectrum for the
time and location of observations. This method was applied to the telluric
H$_{2}$O and O$_2$ absorption removal from a series of 200 ESPRESSO consecutive
exposures of the K2.5V star HD40307, available in ESO archives. We calculated
the radial velocity using the standard Cross-Correlation Function (CCF) method
and Gaussian fit of the CCF, with uncorrected spectra and the ESPRESSO standard
stellar binary mask on one hand, and telluric-corrected spectra and an
augmented binary mask with 696 additional lines on the other hand. We find that
the precision of radial velocity measurements is improved in the second case,
with a reduction of the average formal error from 1.04 ms$^{-1}$ down to 0.78
ms$^{-1}$ in the case of these ESPRESSO data and this stellar type for the red
arm. Using an estimator of the minimal error based on photon noise limit
applied to the full CCF, the error is reduced from 0.89 ms$^{-1}$ down to 0.78

observing time to reach the same precision in the red part.

plethora of bespoke discretization schemes and platform-dependent
implementations using targeted numerical treatments near discontinuities.
Developing such schemes and implementations takes decades of research, tens of
millions of dollars, and significant level of effort (LoE) by computational and
domain experts in their respective communities. We introduce the paradigm of
""inverse asymptotic treatment"" (IAT) of discontinuities in fluid flows through
modification of the governing partial differential equations (PDEs). These
modifications, applied at a semantic and platform-independent level, enable
using standard numerical schemes to discretize and integrate the modified PDEs,
making them more directly computable and yielding orders of magnitude reduction
in cost and LoE via automation. We outline IAT for phase-field modeling of
two-phase incompressible flows, but to showcase its generality, we deploy it
for single-phase compressible flows, involving shock and contact
discontinuities, as localized artificial diffusivity (LAD) methods. Using
canonical problems, we show that traditional LAD allows standard
non-dissipative schemes but requires free-parameter tuning. Nevertheless, its
application to a laminar hypersonic compression corner shows IAT's ability to,
within just a few months, rapidly prototype solvers whose performance and
predictive capacity comes close to state-of-the-art bespoke schemes developed
and optimized over years or even decades. Finally, we propose a novel LAD
approach via ""reverse-engineered"", TVD-inspired PDE modifications that, when
combined with second-order central differencing, is robust, accurate, and free

  Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning from demonstration (LfD) has the potential to greatly increase the
applicability of robotic manipulators in modern industrial applications. Recent
progress in LfD methods have put more emphasis in learning robustness than in
guiding the demonstration itself in order to improve robustness. The latter is
particularly important to consider when the target system reproducing the
motion is structurally different to the demonstration system, as some
demonstrated motions may not be reproducible. In light of this, this paper
introduces a new guided learning from demonstration paradigm where an
interactive graphical user interface (GUI) guides the user during
demonstration, preventing them from demonstrating non-reproducible motions. The
key aspect of our approach is determining the space of reproducible motions
based on a motion planning framework which finds regions in the task space
where trajectories are guaranteed to be of bounded length. We evaluate our
method on two different setups with a six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) UR5 as the
target system. First our method is validated using a seven-DOF Sawyer as the
demonstration system. Then an extensive user study is carried out where several
participants are asked to demonstrate, with and without guidance, a mock weld
task using a hand held tool tracked by a VICON system. With guidance users were
able to always carry out the task successfully in comparison to only 44% of the
time without guidance.

topological data analysis. Many methods have been proposed to deal with the
stability for persistent modules or persistence diagrams. The persistent
Laplacians, as a relatively new topological persistence, have gained more
attention and applications in different fields. In this paper, we start to
consider the stability for persistent Laplacians. We introduce the concept of
the Laplacian tree to describe the collection of persistent Laplacians that
persist from a given parameter. We construct the category of Laplacian trees
and prove an algebraic stability theorem for persistence Laplacian trees.
Specifically, our stability theorem is applied to the real-valued functions on

surface (RIS)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output communication
systems is proposed. By deploying a small number of active elements at the RIS,
the RIS can receive and process the training signals. Through the partial
channel state information (CSI) obtained from the active elements, the overall
training overhead to estimate the entire channel can be dramatically reduced.
To minimize the estimation complexity, the proposed technique is based on the
linear combination of partial CSI, which only requires linear matrix
operations. By exploiting the spatial correlation among the RIS elements,
proper weights for the linear combination and normalization factors are
developed. Numerical results show that the proposed technique outperforms other
schemes using the active elements at the RIS in terms of the normalized mean
squared error when the number of active elements is small, which is necessary
to maintain the low cost and power consumption of RIS.

have systematically analyzed the correlations of slope and curvature parameters
of symmetry energy at the saturation density ($\rho_0=0.16 \text{fm}^{-3}$)
with the tidal deformability and stellar radius of non-spinning neutron stars
in the mass range of $1.2 - 1.6 M_\odot$ using a large set of minimally
constrained equations of state (EoSs). The EoSs at low densities correspond to
the nucleonic matter and are constrained by empirical ranges of a few low-order
nuclear matter parameters from the finite nuclei data and the pure neutron
matter EoS from chiral effective field theory. The EoSs at high densities
($\rho > 1.5 - 2\rho_0$) are obtained by a parametric form for the speed of
sound that satisfies the causality condition. Several factors affecting the
correlations between the NS properties and the individual symmetry energy
parameters usually encountered in the literature are considered. These
correlations are quite sensitive to the choice of the distributions of symmetry
energy parameters and their interdependence. But, variations of NS properties
with the pressure of $\beta -$ equilibrated matter at twice the saturation
density remain quite robust which maybe due to the fact that the pressure
depends on the combination of multiple nuclear matter parameters that describe
the symmetric nuclear matter as well as the density dependence of the symmetry
energy. Our results are practically insensitive to the behavior of EoS at high

with intricate and irregular structures in astrophysics and cosmology. It is
crucial to propose precise and fast algorithms for the CWT. In this work, we
review and compare four different fast CWT algorithms for the 1D signals,
including the FFTCWT, the V97CWT, the M02CWT, and the A19CWT. The FFTCWT
algorithm implements the CWT using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with a
computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N\log_2N)$ per scale. The rest
algorithms achieve the complexity of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ per scale by simplifying
the CWT into some smaller convolutions. We illustrate explicitly how to set the
parameters as well as the boundary conditions for them. To examine the actual
performance of these algorithms, we use them to perform the CWT of signals with
different wavelets. From the aspect of accuracy, we find that the FFTCWT is the
most accurate algorithm, though its accuracy degrades a lot when processing the
non-periodic signal with zero boundaries. The accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(N)$
algorithms is robust to signals with different boundaries, and the M02CWT is
more accurate than the V97CWT and A19CWT. From the aspect of speed, the
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ algorithms do not show an overall speed superiority over the
FFTCWT at sampling numbers of $N\lesssim10^6$, which is due to their large
leading constants. Only the speed of the V97CWT with real wavelets is
comparable to that of the FFTCWT. However, both the FFTCWT and V97CWT are
substantially less efficient in processing the non-periodic signal because of
zero padding. Finally, we conduct wavelet analysis of the 1D density fields,
which demonstrate the convenience and power of techniques based on the CWT. We

many clinical applications at different clinical sites, which may have their
specific application requirements that concern different organs. Introduction:
However, learning high-quality, site-specific organ segmentation models is
challenging as it often needs on-site curation of a large number of annotated
images. Security concerns further complicate the matter. Methods: The paper
aims to tackle these challenges via a two-phase aggregation-then-adaptation
approach. The first phase of federated aggregation learns a single multi-organ
segmentation model by leveraging the strength of 'bigger data', which are
formed by (i) aggregating together datasets from multiple sites that with
different organ labels to provide partial supervision, and (ii) conducting
partially supervised learning without data breach. The second phase of site
adaptation is to transfer the federated multi-organ segmentation model to
site-specific organ segmentation models, one model per site, in order to
further improve the performance of each site's organ segmentation task.
Furthermore, improved marginal loss and exclusion loss functions are used to
avoid 'knowledge conflict' problem in a partially supervision mechanism.
Results and Conclusion: Extensive experiments on five organ segmentation
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-site approach,
significantly outperforming the site-per-se learned models and achieving the
performance comparable to the centrally learned models.

choice analysis in economics. Although Falmagne (1978) obtained an
axiomatization of the random utility model, his characterization requires
strong observability of choices, i.e., that the frequency of choices must be
observed from all subsets of the set of alternatives. Little is known, however,
about the axiomatization when a dataset is incomplete, i.e., the frequencies on
some choice sets are not observable. In fact, it is known that in some cases,
obtaining a tight characterization is NP hard. On the other hand, datasets in
reality almost always violate the requirements on observability assumed by
Falmagne (1978). We consider an incomplete dataset in which we do not observe
frequencies of some alternatives: for all other alternatives, we observe
frequencies. For such a dataset, we obtain a finite system of linear
inequalities that is necessary and sufficient for the dataset to be
rationalized by a random utility model. Moreover, the necessary and sufficient

fine-grained objects (e.g., police cars and ambulances), which is important for
special cases, such as emergency rescue, and so on. To achieve simultaneous
detection for both common and rare objects, we propose a novel task, called
generalized few-shot 3D object detection, where we have a large amount of

classes. Specifically, we analyze in-depth differences between images and point
clouds, and then present a practical principle for the few-shot setting in the

detection framework, including (1) an incremental fine-tuning method to extend
existing 3D detection models to recognize both common and rare objects, and (2)
a sample adaptive balance loss to alleviate the issue of long-tailed data
distribution in autonomous driving scenarios. On the nuScenes dataset, we

denoising for reducing potential radiation risk. However, the widely reported
supervised LDCT denoising networks require a training set of paired images,
which is expensive to obtain and cannot be perfectly simulated. Unsupervised
learning utilizes unpaired data and is highly desirable for LDCT denoising. As
an example, an artifact disentanglement network (ADN) relies on unparied images
and obviates the need for supervision but the results of artifact reduction are
not as good as those through supervised learning.An important observation is
that there is often hidden similarity among unpaired data that can be utilized.
This paper introduces a new learning mode, called quasi-supervised learning, to
empower the ADN for LDCT image denoising.For every LDCT image, the best matched
image is first found from an unpaired normal-dose CT (NDCT) dataset. Then, the
matched pairs and the corresponding matching degree as prior information are
used to construct and train our ADN-type network for LDCT denoising.The
proposed method is different from (but compatible with) supervised and
semi-supervised learning modes and can be easily implemented by modifying
existing networks. The experimental results show that the method is competitive
with state-of-the-art methods in terms of noise suppression and contextual

problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose predictable MDP abstraction (PMA):
instead of training a predictive model on the original MDP, we train a model on
a transformed MDP with a learned action space that only permits predictable,
easy-to-model actions, while covering the original state-action space as much
as possible. As a result, model learning becomes easier and more accurate,
which allows robust, stable model-based planning or model-based RL. This
transformation is learned in an unsupervised manner, before any task is
specified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with model-based
control in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions. We
theoretically analyze PMA and empirically demonstrate that PMA leads to
significant improvements over prior unsupervised model-based RL approaches in a
range of benchmark environments. Our code and videos are available at

representations, is usually an essential step to automate many software
engineering tasks related to code changes, e.g., commit message generation and
just-in-time defect prediction. Intuitively, the quality of code change
representations is crucial for the effectiveness of automated approaches. Prior
work on code changes usually designs and evaluates code change representation
approaches for a specific task, and little work has investigated code change
encoders that can be used and jointly trained on various tasks. To fill this
gap, this work proposes a novel Code Change Representation learning approach
named CCRep, which can learn to encode code changes as feature vectors for
diverse downstream tasks. Specifically, CCRep regards a code change as the
combination of its before-change and after-change code, leverages a pre-trained
code model to obtain high-quality contextual embeddings of code, and uses a
novel mechanism named query back to extract and encode the changed code
fragments and make them explicitly interact with the whole code change. To
evaluate CCRep and demonstrate its applicability to diverse code-change-related
tasks, we apply it to three tasks: commit message generation, patch correctness
assessment, and just-in-time defect prediction. Experimental results show that
CCRep outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques on each task.

leaf nodes. This preserves the intuitive interpretation of decision trees and
at the same time enables them to better capture linear relationships, which is
hard for standard decision trees. But most existing methods for fitting linear
model trees are time consuming and therefore not scalable to large data sets.
In addition, they are more prone to overfitting and extrapolation issues than
standard regression trees. In this paper we introduce PILOT, a new algorithm
for linear model trees that is fast, regularized, stable and interpretable.
PILOT trains in a greedy fashion like classic regression trees, but
incorporates an $L^2$ boosting approach and a model selection rule for fitting
linear models in the nodes. The abbreviation PILOT stands for $PI$ecewise
$L$inear $O$rganic $T$ree, where `organic' refers to the fact that no pruning
is carried out. PILOT has the same low time and space complexity as CART
without its pruning. An empirical study indicates that PILOT tends to
outperform standard decision trees and other linear model trees on a variety of

under weak assumptions. When the data is generated by a linear model, the
convergence rate is polynomial.

studied, the correction of fisheye videos is still an elusive challenge. For
different frames of the fisheye video, the existing image correction methods
ignore the correlation of sequences, resulting in temporal jitter in the

to get a plausible global optical flow, which mitigates the jitter effect by
progressively reducing the weight of frames. Subsequently, we observe that the
inter-frame optical flow of the video is facilitated to perceive the local
spatial deformation of the fisheye video. Therefore, we derive the spatial
deformation through the flows of fisheye and distorted-free videos, thereby
enhancing the local accuracy of the predicted result. However, the independent
correction for each frame disrupts the temporal correlation. Due to the
property of fisheye video, a distorted moving object may be able to find its
distorted-free pattern at another moment. To this end, a temporal deformation
aggregator is designed to reconstruct the deformation correlation between
frames and provide a reliable global feature. Our method achieves an end-to-end

we employ Transformers to effectively encode the driving scene and incorporate
the AV's plan in decoding the predicted trajectories. To train the model to
accurately predict the reactions of other agents, we develop an online learning
framework, where the ego agent explores the environment and collects other

reveal that our decision-making method significantly outperforms the

to investigate to what extent the simultaneous charging of electric vehicles
leads to degraded network operation and to validate the efficiency of
countermeasures. To reduce complexity and CPU time, a common approach while
performing these analyses consists in replacing electric vehicles and their
charging stations with constant PQ loads. However, this approach is inaccurate,
as the power absorbed by these elements actually depends not only on voltage
but also on the state of charge, charging method, cathode chemistry of the
battery pack, and converter controls in the electric vehicle and charging
station. By considering all these aspects, this article develops a novel static
load model and a vector fitting-based dynamic load model for electric vehicles
connected to fast charging stations. These computationally efficient
representations can replace the standard constant PQ load model of electric
vehicles to assess more accurately their impact in static and dynamic grid
studies. Simulation results of the IEEE14 system modified by adding fleets of
electric vehicles prove the accuracy of the proposed models and highlight the
shortcomings of the standard electric vehicle representation as a constant PQ
load in some cases.

iron and steel industry because it is crucial in supplying energy to
manufacturing processes as well as converting energies, such as stream and
electricity. The optimal distribution of byproduct gases in an iron and steel
plant can significantly reduce energy costs and carbon emissions. However, the
balance between supply and demand is easily threatened by the quantity- and
quality-related uncertainties from manufacturing processes. Following the
supply-storage-conversion-demand network, this study developed an optimal gas
distribution model considering uncertain supply and proposed a two-stage robust
optimization (TSRO) model including ""here-and-now"" decisions, which minimize
the start-stop cost of conversion units, and making ""wait-and-see"" decisions,
which minimize the operating costs of gasholders and demand penalties. To
implement the TSRO model in practice, this study proposes a ""first quantify,
then optimize"" method: (1) quantify the uncertainty of surplus gas via a
quantile regression-based multi-step time series model, and (2) find the
optimal solution via a column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally,
this study provides a case study of an industrial energy system to validate the
proposed methodology.

corresponds to the infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of type $B$. We consider
the genus expansion of such important solutions as Br\'{e}zin-Gross-Witten
(BGW) model, Kontsevich model, and generating functions for spin Hurwitz
numbers with completed cycles. We show that these partition functions with
inserted parameter $\hbar$, which controls the genus expansion, are solutions
of the $\hbar$-$B$KP hierarchy with good quasi-classical behavior.
$\hbar$-$B$KP language implies the algorithmic prescription for
$\hbar$-deformation of the mentioned models in terms of hypergeometric $B$KP
$\tau$-functions and gives insight into the similarities and differences
between the models. Firstly, the insertion of $\hbar$ into the Kontsevich model
is similar to the one in the BGW model, though the Kontsevich model seems to be
a very specific example of hypergeometric $\tau$-function. Secondly, generating
functions for spin Hurwitz numbers appear to possess a different prescription
for genus expansion. This property of spin Hurwitz numbers is not the unique
feature of $B$KP: already in the KP hierarchy, one can observe that generating
functions for ordinary Hurwitz numbers with completed cycles are deformed
differently from the standard matrix model examples.

discussion and the relation between authors. Textual information based on a
pre-trained language model and social relation information encoded by
pre-trained RGCN are jointly considered for (dis)agreement detection.
Experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance

We find social relations can boost the performance of the (dis)agreement

the effect of the knowledge graph embedding methods, the information fusing

cross-entropy loss. Yet this ubiquitous choice is supported by little
theoretical or empirical evidence. Recent work (Hui & Belkin, 2020) suggests
that training using the (rescaled) square loss is often superior in terms of
the classification accuracy. In this paper we propose the ""squentropy"" loss,
which is the sum of two terms: the cross-entropy loss and the average square
loss over the incorrect classes. We provide an extensive set of experiments on
multi-class classification problems showing that the squentropy loss
outperforms both the pure cross entropy and rescaled square losses in terms of
the classification accuracy. We also demonstrate that it provides significantly
better model calibration than either of these alternative losses and,
furthermore, has less variance with respect to the random initialization.
Additionally, in contrast to the square loss, squentropy loss can typically be
trained using exactly the same optimization parameters, including the learning
rate, as the standard cross-entropy loss, making it a true ""plug-and-play""
replacement. Finally, unlike the rescaled square loss, multiclass squentropy
contains no parameters that need to be adjusted.

Driving performance is evaluated by tracking, efficiency, safety and comfort

comparison principles to symmetric spaces and deduce different types of

relativistic and general orders Schr\""odinger equations. In particular, we
observe that some smoothing properties, which are known to fail on the
Euclidean plane, hold on the hyperbolic plane.

application in renewable energy materials. However, the effect of external
dopants on the performance of perovskite solar cell is yet to be understood
properly. Oxygen atom or molecule is important dopant to influence the
stability of structural, electronic and optical properties as well as the
performance of perovskite solar cells. RbPbX3-type perovskites have fantastic
chemical stability and good power conversion efficiency. Here for the first
time, we have studied the effect of interstitial oxygen atom (O1) and molecule
(O2) on the structural properties, and hence the electronic structure of RbPbI3
from first principles. A significant reduction of the band gap from ~2.6 eV to
~ 1.0 eV, which is close to the optimal band gap, has been predicted when
incorporating oxygen. This could in turn be applied to improve the optical
properties for harvesting light if we can control the oxygen level
appropriately. In addition, an exotic metallic state has been found in our
calculations for interstitial oxygen molecule when there are strong O-O, O-Pb,
and O-I bonds, indicating the complex nature of oxygen-doped perovskite solar
cells. The comparison between oxygen atom and molecules is consistent with the
previous report about oxygen-molecule passivation of perovskite solar cells.
This indicated oxygen incorporation can not only improve efficiency and
stability but also facilitate the optimal band-gap engineering. Our work has
therefore provided an important and timely theoretical insight to the effect of
oxygen dopants in perovskite solar cells. Moreover, these results also provide
theoretical foundation for further simulations such as molecular dynamics.

the effective solutions is the sequential recommendation that relies on click

positive feedback, respectively. With the mixture of positive and negative
feedback, it is challenging to capture the transition pattern of behavioral
sequence. To do so, FeedRec has exploited a shared vanilla Transformer, which
may be inelegant because head interaction of multi-heads attention does not
consider different types of feedback. In this paper, we propose Dual-interest
Factorization-heads Attention for Sequential Recommendation (short for DFAR)
consisting of feedback-aware encoding layer, dual-interest disentangling layer
and prediction layer. In the feedback-aware encoding layer, we first suppose
each head of multi-heads attention can capture specific feedback relations.
Then we further propose factorization-heads attention which can mask specific
head interaction and inject feedback information so as to factorize the
relation between different types of feedback. Additionally, we propose a
dual-interest disentangling layer to decouple positive and negative interests
before performing disentanglement on their representations. Finally, we evolve
the positive and negative interests by corresponding towers whose outputs are
contrastive by BPR loss. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the

unmodified containers while providing strong security protection against a
powerful attacker who controls the untrusted host and hypervisor. Parma
leverages VM-level isolation to execute a container group within a unique
VM-based TEE. Besides container integrity and user data confidentiality and
integrity, Parma also offers container attestation and execution integrity
based on an attested execution policy. Parma execution policies provide an
inductive proof over all future states of the container group. This proof,
which is established during initialization, forms a root of trust that can be
used for secure operations within the container group without requiring any
modifications of the containerized workflow itself (aside from the inclusion of
the execution policy.) We evaluate Parma on AMD SEV-SNP processors by running a
diverse set of workloads demonstrating that workflows exhibit 0-26% additional
overhead in performance over running outside the enclave, with a mean 13%
overhead on SPEC2017, while requiring no modifications to their program code.
Adding execution policies introduces less than 1% additional overhead.

complexity of circuit augmentation schemes for linear programming and for
finding lower bounds on combinatorial diameters. The main open problem in this
area is the circuit diameter conjecture, the analogue of the Hirsch conjecture
in the circuit setting. A natural question is whether the well-known
counterexamples to the Hirsch conjecture carry over. Previously, Stephen and
Yusun showed that the Klee-Walkup counterexample to the unbounded Hirsch
conjecture does not transfer to the circuit setting. Our main contribution is
to show that the original counterexamples for the other variants, for bounded
polytopes and using monotone walks, also do not transfer.
  Our results rely on new observations on structural properties of these
counterexamples. To resolve the bounded case, we exploit the geometry of
certain $2$-faces of the polytopes underlying all known bounded Hirsch
counterexamples in Santos' work. For Todd's monotone Hirsch counterexample, we
provide two alternative approaches. The first one uses sign-compatible circuit
walks, and the second one uses the observation that Todd's polytope is
anti-blocking. Along the way, we enumerate all linear programs over the
polytope and find four new orientations that contradict the monotone Hirsch
conjecture, while the remaining $7107$ satisfy the bound.

research has put forward hierarchical learning, a coherency-informed

potentials were outlined, results exhibited discordant performances in which
coherency information only improved hierarchical forecasts in one setting. This
work proposes to tackle these obstacles by investigating custom neural network

that, in a data-limited setting, structural models with fewer connections
perform overall best and demonstrate the coherency information value for both
accuracy and coherency forecasting performances, provided individual forecasts
were generated within reasonable accuracy limits. Overall, this work expands

catalogue of high-precision and accurate magnesium and calcium abundances from
a wide variety of stars well distributed in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR)

fit the ultraviolet-blue (UVB) and visible (VIS) spectra. We tested the
consistency of the atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances with the Gaia
DR3 and the AMBRE Project datasets. We have finally obtained precise [Mg/Fe]

have measurements in both elements. The stars cover a broad range of effective
temperature 4000 < T$_{\rm eff}$ < 6500K, surface gravity 0.3 < log(g) < 4.8 cm
s$^{\rm -2}$, and metallicity -2.5 < [Fe/H] < +0.4 dex. We find an excellent
agreement with the abundance estimates from the AMBRE:HARPS and the Gaia/RVS
(Radial Velocity Spectrometer) analysis. Moreover, the resulting abundances
reproduce a plateau in the metal-poor regime followed by a decreasing trend
even at supersolar metallicities, as predicted by Galactic chemical evolution
models. This catalogue is suitable for improving the modelling of evolutionary
stellar population models with empirical $\alpha$-enhancements, which could
significantly contribute to the analysis of external galaxies abundances in the
near future.

hairy black hole with the secondary hair to reach a stable thermal equilibrium
with the heat bath. Specifically, if the scalar hair, induced by interactions
of the matter fields with quadratic-curvature corrections, produces an inner
horizon in the deformed geometry, a thermodynamically stable configuration will
be reached with the black hole becoming extremal in its final stage. We also
attempt to make some conjectures concerning the implications of this thermal
stability for the existence of a minimum length in a quantum space time.

Caldeira-Leggett Hamiltonian modified by adding a term proportional to the
strain-rate tensor according to Hoover's DOLLS method, and we derive a
generalized Langevin equation for the sheared system. We then compute,
analytically, the noise time-correlation functions in different regimes. Based
on the intensity of the shear-rate, we can distinguish between
close-to-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium states. According to the results
presented here, the standard, simple and Markovian form of the Langevin
equation with shear flow postulated in the literature is valid only in the
limit of extremely weak shear rates compared to the effective vibrational
temperature of the bath. For even marginally higher shear rates, the
(generalized) Langevin equation is strongly non-Markovian and non-trivial

genus $3$ hyperelliptic curves. Then, Hashimoto and Morrison [8] did the same

provide a measure of orthographic similarity between letter strings. These
models tend to include hand-coded orthographic representations with single unit
coding for specific forms of knowledge (e.g., units coding for a letter in a
given position). Here we assess how well a range of these coding schemes and
models account for the pattern of form priming effects taken from the Form
Priming Project and compare these findings to results observed with 11 standard
deep neural network models (DNNs) developed in computer science. We find that
deep convolutional networks (CNNs) perform as well or better than the coding
schemes and word recognition models, whereas transformer networks did less
well. The success of CNNs is remarkable as their architectures were not
developed to support word recognition (they were designed to perform well on
object recognition), they classify pixel images of words (rather than
artificial encodings of letter strings), and their training was highly
simplified (not respecting many key aspects of human experience). In addition
to these form priming effects, we find that the DNNs can account for visual
similarity effects on priming that are beyond all current psychological models
of priming. The findings add to the recent work of (Hannagan et al., 2021) and
suggest that CNNs should be given more attention in psychology as models of

coupling (SOC) on the correlation effects of magnetic impurities by combining
the variational method and the Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo (HFQMC)
simulations. Markedly different from the normal $k$-linear Rashba SOC, even a
small cubic Rashba term can greatly alter the band structure and induce a Van
Hove singularity in a wide range of energy, thus the single impurity local
moment becomes largely tunable. The cubic Rashba SOC adopted in this work
breaks the rotational symmetry, but the host material is still invariant under
the operations $\mathcal{R}^z(\pi)$, $\mathcal{IR}^z(\pi/2)$,
$\mathcal{M}_{xz}$, $\mathcal{M}_{yz}$, where $\mathcal{R}^z(\theta)$ is the
rotation of angle $\theta$ about the $z$-axis, $\mathcal{I}$ is the inversion
operator and $\mathcal{M}_{xz}$ ($\mathcal{M}_{yz}$) is the mirror reflection
about the $x$-$z$ ($y$-$z$) principal plane. Saliently, various components of
spin-spin correlation between the single magnetic impurity and the conduction
electrons show three- or six-fold rotational symmetry. This unique feature is
due to the triple winding of the spins with a $2\pi$ rotation of $\mathbf{k}$,
which is a hallmark of the cubic Rashba effect and can possibly be an
identifier to distinguish the cubic Rashba SOC from the normal $k$-linear
Rashba term in experiments. Although the cubic Rashba term drastically alters
the electronic properties of the host, we find that the spatial decay rate of
the spin-spin correlation function remains essentially unchanged. Moreover, the
carrier-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions between two
magnetic impurities show twisted features, the ferromagnetic diagonal terms
dominate when two magnetic impurities are very close, but the off-diagonal
terms become important at long distances.

functions that, given a set $S$ of labeled examples, decide whether to split

not seen during the training process. Recently, Unified Open-set Recognition
(UOSR) has been proposed to reject not only unknown samples but also known but
wrongly classified samples, which tends to be more practical in real-world
applications. The UOSR draws little attention since it is proposed, but we find
sometimes it is even more practical than OSR in the real world applications, as
evaluation results of known but wrongly classified samples are also wrong like
unknown samples. In this paper, we deeply analyze the UOSR task under different
training and evaluation settings to shed light on this promising research
direction. For this purpose, we first evaluate the UOSR performance of several
OSR methods and show a significant finding that the UOSR performance
consistently surpasses the OSR performance by a large margin for the same
method. We show that the reason lies in the known but wrongly classified
samples, as their uncertainty distribution is extremely close to unknown
samples rather than known and correctly classified samples. Second, we analyze
how the two training settings of OSR (i.e., pre-training and outlier exposure)
influence the UOSR. We find although they are both beneficial for
distinguishing known and correctly classified samples from unknown samples,
pre-training is also helpful for identifying known but wrongly classified
samples while outlier exposure is not. In addition to different training
settings, we also formulate a new evaluation setting for UOSR which is called
few-shot UOSR, where only one or five samples per unknown class are available
during evaluation to help identify unknown samples. We propose FS-KNNS for the
few-shot UOSR to achieve state-of-the-art performance under all settings.

We analyzed the gas kinematics based on the CO image cube and obtained the
rotation curve and radial distribution of velocity dispersion. The velocity
dispersion is about $30\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ in the outer CO disk region and rises
up to $\gtrsim 100\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ at radius $\lesssim 1\,$kpc, suggesting
that the central region of disk is dynamically hot. We constrain the CO-to-$\rm
H_2$ conversion factor, $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, by modeling the cold gas disk
dynamics. We find that, with prior knowledge about the stellar and dark matter
components, the $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ value in the circumnuclear region of this

velocity dispersion in the central region. We find that the ISM turbulent
pressure derived from the gas velocity dispersion is in equilibrium with the

non-intersecting congruence of conformal geodesics. Thus, the future domain
dependence of suitable spacelike hypersurfaces in the Cosmological region of
the spacetime can be expressed in terms of a conformal Gaussian gauge. A
perturbative argument then allows to prove existence and stability results
close to the conformal boundary and away from the asymptotic points where the
cosmological horizon intersects the conformal boundary. In particular, we show
that small enough perturbations of initial data for the sub-extremal

vertically extended. We detect a narrow iron line in the energy spectra, which
we interpret to be due to the illumination of the outer part of the accretion

transients, massive stars have received renewed interest in recent years.
However, many aspects of their birth and evolution remain opaque, particularly
in the context of binary interactions. The centre of our galaxy hosts a rich
cohort of very massive stars, which appear to play a prominent role in the
ecology of the region. In this paper we investigate the binary properties of
the Arches cluster, which is thought to host a large number of very massive
stars. A combination of multi-epoch near-IR spectroscopy and photometry was
utilised to identify binaries. 13 from 36 cluster members meet our criteria to
be classed as RV variable. Combining the spectroscopic data with archival radio
and X-ray observations - to detect colliding wind systems - provides a lower
limit to the binary fraction of ~43%; increasing to >50% for the O-type
hypergiants and WNLha. Dynamical and evolutionary masses reveal the primaries
to be uniformly massive (>50M$_{\odot}$). Where available, orbital analysis
reveals a number of short period, highly eccentric binaries, which appear to be
pre-interaction systems. Such systems are X-ray luminous, with 80% above an
empirical bound of $(L_{\rm x}/L_{\rm bol})\sim10^{-7}$ and their orbital
configurations suggest formation and evolution via a single star channel;
however, we cannot exclude a binary formation channel for a subset. Qualitative
comparison to surveys of lower mass OB-type stars confirms that the trend to an
extreme binary fraction (>60%) extends to the most massive stars currently
forming in the local Universe.

from poor data efficiency while the latter is difficult when test tasks are
out-of-distribution. Agents that can effectively transfer their knowledge about
the world pose a potential solution to these issues. In this paper, we
investigate transfer learning in the context of model-based agents.
Specifically, we aim to understand when exactly environment models have an
advantage and why. We find that a model-based approach outperforms controlled
model-free baselines for transfer learning. Through ablations, we show that
both the policy and dynamics model learnt through exploration matter for
successful transfer. We demonstrate our results across three domains which vary
in their requirements for transfer: in-distribution procedural (Crafter),
in-distribution identical (RoboDesk), and out-of-distribution (Meta-World). Our
results show that intrinsic exploration combined with environment models
present a viable direction towards agents that are self-supervised and able to

Unlike to thinner and strained HgTe films, which are known as high-quality

thicker than the limit of pseudomorphic growth of HgTe on a CdTe substrate.
Therefore, it is expected to be fully relaxed and has the band structure of
bulk HgTe, i.e., a zero gap semiconductor. Nevertheless, since the bands
inversion the two-dimensional (2D) topological surface states are still
expected to exist. To check this claim we studied classical and quantum
transport response of the system. We demonstrate that by tuning the top-gate
voltage one can change the electron-dominating transport to the hole one. The
highest electron mobility is found to be more than $300 \times 10^3$ cm$^2$/Vs.
The system exhibits Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations with a complicated

Volkov-Pankratov states and spin-degenerate bulk states in the accumulation

maximum-likelihood regression of count data. The method is applicable in
particular to X-ray spectra in situations where the Poisson log-likelihood, or
the Cash goodness-of-fit statistic, indicate a poor fit that is attributable to
overdispersion of the data. Overdispersion in Poisson data is treated as an
intrinsic model variance that can be estimated from the best-fit model, using
the maximum-likelihood Cmin statistic. The paper also studies the effects of
such systematic errors on the Delta C likelihood-ratio statistic, which can be
used to test for the presence of a nested model component in the regression of
Poisson count data. The paper introduces an overdispersed chi-square
distribution that results from the convolution of a chi-square distribution
that models the usual Delta C statistic, and a zero-mean Gaussian that models
the overdispersion in the data. This is proposed as the distribution of choice
for the Delta C statistic in the presence of systematic errors. The methods
presented in this paper are applied to XMM-Newton data of the quasar 1ES
1553+113 that were used to detect absorption lines from an intervening warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM). This case study illustrates how systematic errors
can be estimated from the data, and their effect on the detection of a nested

Current solutions to bridge the sim2real gap involve hybrid simulators that are
augmented with neural residual models. Unfortunately, they require a separate
residual model for each individual environment configuration (i.e., a fixed
setting of environment variables such as mass, friction etc.), and thus are not
transferable to new environments quickly. To address this issue, we propose a
Reverse Action Transformation (RAT) policy which learns to imitate simulated
policies in the real-world. Once learnt from a single environment, RAT can then
be deployed on top of a Universal Policy Network to achieve zero-shot

to measure in gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. It is well-known that the
measurement is affected by cosmological redshift, and recent works also showed
that Doppler and gravitational redshifts could further affect the result if the
BBH coalesces close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Here we consider the
additional lensing effect induced by the nearby SMBH on the measurement. We
compute the null geodesics originating within $10$ gravitational radii of a
Kerr SMBH to determine the redshift and magnification of the GWs emitted by the
BBH. We find a positive correlation between redshift and demagnification, which
results in a positive correlation between the mass and distance of the BBH in
the detector frame. More importantly, we find a higher probability for the
signal to appear redshifted and demagnified to a distant observer, rather than
blueshifted and magnified. Based on these results, we show that a binary at a
cosmological redshift of $z_{\rm cos}=(10^{-2}-10^{-1})$ and composed of BHs of
$(10-20)M_\odot$ could masquerade as a BBH at a redshift of $z_{\rm cos}\sim1$

demagnification, we also find that the same BBH could appear to be at $z_{\rm

are evaluated with respect to the user's desired future state. If the predicted
future events do not comply with this state, actions are taken towards
achieving desirable future states. Evidently, event prediction is valuable in
many application domains such as business and natural disasters. The diversity
of application domains results in a diverse range of methods that are scattered

diffuse, but skyrmions and half-skyrmions, spatially localised quasiparticles,
exhibit normal diffusion in dilute conditions. However, the cooperative

structural relaxation, is suppressed by cages formed by surrounding
half-skyrmions, whereas enhanced by Mermin-Wagner fluctuation characteristic to
two-dimensional systems, leading to subdiffusive motion. Large displacement of
half-skyrmions is locally induced by fusion-fission and bond-breaking between
adjacent half-skyrmions. Furthermore, the motion of half-skyrmions couples with
transverse and longitudinal sound wave excitation differently. Our result
provides a qualitative difference in dynamical properties between skyrmion
gaseous and condensed phases, suggesting the efficient manipulation of
high-density (half-)skyrmions in molecular crystals, liquid crystals, and

We present our integrated wearable sensor system, describe data fusion and

these methods sacrifice a good deal of the average robust accuracy.
Accordingly, this paper proposes a novel framework of worst-class adversarial

obtain a classifier with great performance on worst-class and sacrifice just a
little average robust accuracy at the same time. We then rigorously analyze the

bound in terms of the worst-class robust risk. Furthermore, we propose a

with the goal of improving the generalization of the model to unseen tasks that

exploit the continuous scanning property of lidar to adaptively divide the full
scan into multiple partial scans (named sub-frames) according to the motion
intensity. And to avoid the degradation of sub-frames resulting from
insufficient constraints, we propose a robust state estimation method based on
a tightly-coupled iterated error state Kalman smoother (ESKS) framework.
Furthermore, we propose a robocentric voxel map (RC-Vox) to improve the

k nearest neighbor (k-NN) queries by mapping local map points into a
fixed-size, two-layer 3D array structure. Extensive experiments are conducted

that our system can achieve stable tracking in aggressive motion scenes
(angular velocity up to 21.8 rad/s) that cannot be handled by other

with these methods in general scenes. Furthermore, thanks to the RC-Vox, our

  Breaks Transfer Learning Conventions",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep perceptual loss is a type of loss function in computer vision that aims
to mimic human perception by using the deep features extracted from neural
networks. In recent years the method has been applied to great effect on a host
of interesting computer vision tasks, especially for tasks with image or
image-like outputs. Many applications of the method use pretrained networks,
often convolutional networks, for loss calculation. Despite the increased
interest and broader use, more effort is needed toward exploring which networks
to use for calculating deep perceptual loss and from which layers to extract
the features.
  This work aims to rectify this by systematically evaluating a host of
commonly used and readily available, pretrained networks for a number of
different feature extraction points on four existing use cases of deep
perceptual loss. The four use cases are implementations of previous works where
the selected networks and extraction points are evaluated instead of the
networks and extraction points used in the original work. The experimental
tasks are dimensionality reduction, image segmentation, super-resolution, and
perceptual similarity. The performance on these four tasks, attributes of the
networks, and extraction points are then used as a basis for an in-depth
analysis. This analysis uncovers essential information regarding which
architectures provide superior performance for deep perceptual loss and how to
choose an appropriate extraction point for a particular task and dataset.
Furthermore, the work discusses the implications of the results for deep
perceptual loss and the broader field of transfer learning. The results break
commonly held assumptions in transfer learning, which imply that deep
perceptual loss deviates from most transfer learning settings or that these
assumptions need a thorough re-evaluation.

to construct useful features representing the problem instances and then apply
feature-based machine learning models to predict which algorithm works best

Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), there lacks a general and effective
feature representation for problem instances. The important features of TSP are
relatively well understood in the literature, based on extensive domain
knowledge and post-analysis of the solutions. In recent years, Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) has become a popular approach to select algorithms for
TSP. Compared to traditional feature-based machine learning models, CNN has an
automatic feature-learning ability and demands less domain expertise. However,
it is still required to generate intermediate representations, i.e., multiple
images to represent TSP instances first. In this paper, we revisit the
algorithm selection problem for TSP, and propose a novel Graph Neural Network
(GNN), called GINES. GINES takes the coordinates of cities and distances
between cities as input. It is composed of a new message-passing mechanism and
a local neighborhood feature extractor to learn spatial information of TSP
instances. We evaluate GINES on two benchmark datasets. The results show that
GINES outperforms CNN and the original GINE models. It is better than the
traditional handcrafted feature-based approach on one dataset. The code and

multiple competing properties in a sample-efficient manner. In this work, we
propose a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) algorithm leveraging the
hypernetwork-based GFlowNets (HN-GFN) as an acquisition function optimizer,
with the purpose of sampling a diverse batch of candidate molecular graphs from
an approximate Pareto front. Using a single preference-conditioned
hypernetwork, HN-GFN learns to explore various trade-offs between objectives.
Inspired by reinforcement learning, we further propose a hindsight-like
off-policy strategy to share high-performing molecules among different
preferences in order to speed up learning for HN-GFN. Through synthetic
experiments, we illustrate that HN-GFN has adequate capacity to generalize over
preferences. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms the best
baselines by a large margin in terms of hypervolume in various real-world MOBO

optimization (BO) is a popular framework that finds near-optimal configurations
given sufficient budget, but it suffers from the re-optimization issue and is
not practical in real production. When applying transfer learning to accelerate
the tuning process, we notice two domain-specific challenges: 1) most previous
work focus on transferring tuning history, while expert knowledge from Spark
engineers is of great potential to improve the tuning performance but is not
well studied so far; 2) history tasks should be carefully utilized, where using
dissimilar ones lead to a deteriorated performance in production. In this

literature. These deep learning models are usually pre-trained through a
self-supervised objective, meant to provide the model with basic knowledge
about a language of interest (e.g., Java). A classic pre-training objective is
the masked language model (MLM), in which a percentage of tokens from the input
(e.g., a Java method) is masked, with the model in charge of predicting them.
Once pre-trained, the model is then fine-tuned to support the specific
downstream task of interest (e.g., code summarization). While there is evidence
suggesting the boost in performance provided by pre-training, little is known
about the impact of the specific pre-training objective(s) used. Indeed, MLM is
just one of the possible pre-training objectives and recent work from the
natural language processing field suggest that pre-training objectives tailored
for the specific downstream task of interest may substantially boost the
model's performance. In this study, we focus on the impact of pre-training
objectives on the performance of transformers when automating code-related
tasks. We start with a systematic literature review aimed at identifying the
pre-training objectives used in SE. Then, we pre-train 32 transformers using
both (i) generic pre-training objectives usually adopted in SE; and (ii)
pre-training objectives tailored to specific code-related tasks subject of our
experimentation, namely bug-fixing, code summarization, and code completion. We
also compare the pre-trained models with non pre-trained ones. Our results show
that: (i) pre-training helps in boosting performance only if the amount of
fine-tuning data available is small; (ii) the MLM objective is usually
sufficient to maximize the prediction performance of the model, even when
comparing it with pre-training objectives specialized for the downstream task
at hand.

often fail to classify long series since they rely on careful imputation, which
easily over- or under-samples the relevant regions. Using this insight, we then
propose CAT, a model that classifies multivariate ITS by explicitly seeking
highly-relevant portions of an input series' timeline. CAT achieves this by
integrating three components: (1) A Moment Network learns to seek relevant
moments in an ITS's continuous timeline using reinforcement learning. (2) A
Receptor Network models the temporal dynamics of both observations and their
timing localized around predicted moments. (3) A recurrent Transition Model
models the sequence of transitions between these moments, cultivating a
representation with which the series is classified. Using synthetic and real

short signals in long irregular time series.

cm power spectrum recovery when analytically marginalizing over foreground

contaminating foreground emission, BayesEoR jointly constructs models for both
signals within a Bayesian framework. Due to computational constraints, the
forward model is constructed using a restricted field-of-view (FoV) in the
image domain. When the only EoR contaminants are noise and foregrounds, we
demonstrate that BayesEoR can accurately recover the 21 cm power spectrum when
the component of sky emission outside this forward-modelled region is
downweighted by the beam at the level of the dynamic range between the
foreground and 21 cm signals. However, when all-sky foreground emission is
included along with a realistic instrument primary beam with sidelobes above
this threshold extending to the horizon, the recovered power spectrum is
contaminated by unmodelled sky emission outside the restricted FoV model.
Expanding the combined cosmological and foreground model to cover the whole sky
is computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a modified version
of BayesEoR that allows for an all-sky foreground model, while the modelled 21
cm signal remains only within the primary FoV of the telescope. With this
modification, it will be feasible to run an all-sky BayesEoR analysis on a
sizeable compute cluster. We also discuss several future directions for further
reducing the need to model all-sky foregrounds, including wide-field foreground
subtraction, an image-domain likelihood utilizing a tapering function, and

embedding features in benchmark datasets are somehow overlooked, which
potentially limits the performance of EAGMs, while most researchers focus on
how to improve EAGMs. Therefore, we conduct a systematic evaluation of ten
representative EAGMs and prove that even embarrassedly simple modifications on

So it's time to pay more attention to the current embedding features in

results, they are fully deterministic and do not provide uncertainty
estimations for the predictions. In this work, we introduce the Attention
Gaussian Process (AGP) model, a novel probabilistic attention mechanism based
on Gaussian Processes for deep MIL. AGP provides accurate bag-level predictions
as well as instance-level explainability, and can be trained end-to-end.
Moreover, its probabilistic nature guarantees robustness to overfitting on
small datasets and uncertainty estimations for the predictions. The latter is
especially important in medical applications, where decisions have a direct
impact on the patient's health. The proposed model is validated experimentally
as follows. First, its behavior is illustrated in two synthetic MIL experiments
based on the well-known MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Then, it is
evaluated in three different real-world cancer detection experiments. AGP
outperforms state-of-the-art MIL approaches, including deterministic deep
learning ones. It shows a strong performance even on a small dataset with less
than 100 labels and generalizes better than competing methods on an external
test set. Moreover, we experimentally show that predictive uncertainty
correlates with the risk of wrong predictions, and therefore it is a good
indicator of reliability in practice. Our code is publicly available.

adaptive data-driven approaches. The idea of using behavioral systems theory
for this purpose has recently found traction in the academic community. In this
study, we compare variations thereof with different amounts of data used,
different regularization weights, and different methods of data selection.
Autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) are used as a
well-established reference. All methods are evaluated by performing iterative
system identification on two long-term data sets from real occupied buildings,
neither of which include artificial excitation for the purpose of system
identification. We find that: (1) Sufficient prediction accuracy is achieved
with all methods. (2) The ARX models perform slightly better, while having the
additional advantages of fewer tuning parameters and faster computation. (3)
Adaptive and non-adaptive schemes perform similarly. (4) The regularization
weights of the behavioral systems theory methods show the expected trade-off
characteristic with an optimal middle value. (5) Using the most recent data

This paper introduces LRProp -- a novel weakly-supervised representation
learning approach, with an emphasis on the application of temporal alignment
between pairs of videos of the same action category. The proposed approach uses
a transformer encoder for extracting frame-level features, and employs the DTW
algorithm within the training iterations in order to identify the alignment
path between video pairs. Through a process referred to as ``pair-wise position
propagation'', the probability distributions of these correspondences per
location are matched with the similarity of the frame-level features via
KL-divergence minimization. The proposed algorithm uses also a regularized
SoftDTW loss for better tuning the learned features. Our novel representation
learning paradigm consistently outperforms the state of the art on temporal

Many computational approaches have been proposed to estimate such Monge maps
when $c$ is the $\ell_2^2$ distance, e.g., using entropic maps [Pooladian'22],
or neural networks [Makkuva'20, Korotin'20]. We propose a new model for
transport maps, built on a family of translation invariant costs $c(x,
y):=h(x-y)$, where $h:=\tfrac{1}{2}\|\cdot\|_2^2+\tau$ and $\tau$ is a
regularizer. We propose a generalization of the entropic map suitable for $h$,
and highlight a surprising link tying it with the Bregman centroids of the
divergence $D_h$ generated by $h$, and the proximal operator of $\tau$. We show
that choosing a sparsity-inducing norm for $\tau$ results in maps that apply
Occam's razor to transport, in the sense that the displacement vectors
$\Delta(x):= T(x)-x$ they induce are sparse, with a sparsity pattern that
varies depending on $x$. We showcase the ability of our method to estimate
meaningful OT maps for high-dimensional single-cell transcription data, in the

type-II multiferroic material where ferroelectricity, driven by incommensurate
spiral magnetic order, is believed to be achievable up to temperatures higher
than room temperature. A cycloidal spiral rather than helical spiral order is
essential ingredient for the existence of ferroelectricity in this material.
Motivated by a recent experimental work on Mn-doped YBCFO where the spiral
plane is observed to cant more towards the crystallographic $c$ axis upon Mn
doping at Fe sites compared to that in the parent compound, we performed a
detailed theoretical investigation using the density functional theory
calculations to understand the mechanism behind such spin reorientation. Our
total energy calculations, within GGA+U+SO approximation, reveal that Fe/Cu
spin moments indeed align more towards $c$ axis in the Mn-doped compounds than
they were in parent compound YBCFO. Largest exchange interaction (Cu-Cu in the
$ab$-plane) is observed to decrease systematically with Mn doping concentration
reflecting the lowering of transition temperature seen in experiment. Further,
the inter-bilayer Cu-Mn exchange interaction becomes ferromagnetic in the doped
compound whereas the corresponding Cu-Fe exchange was antiferromagnetic in the
parent compound giving rise to frustration in the commensurate magnetic order.
Most importantly, our electronic structure calculations reveal that in the
doped compounds because of hybridization with the d$_{z^2}$ orbital of Mn, the
highest occupied Cu orbital becomes d$_{z^2}$ as opposed to the parent compound
where the highest occupied Cu orbital is d$_{x^2-y^2}$. Therefore, we believe
that the occupancy of out of plane oriented Cu d$_{z^2}$ orbital in place of
planar d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital along with the frustrating exchange interaction
drive the spins to align along $c$ in doped compound.

Learning (FL), decentralized FL (DFL) discards the central server and each

network. However, existing DFL suffers from high inconsistency among local
clients, which results in severe distribution shift and inferior performance
compared with centralized FL (CFL), especially on heterogeneous data or sparse
communication topology. To alleviate this issue, we propose two DFL algorithms
named DFedSAM and DFedSAM-MGS to improve the performance of DFL. Specifically,
DFedSAM leverages gradient perturbation to generate local flat models via
Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM), which searches for models with uniformly
low loss values. DFedSAM-MGS further boosts DFedSAM by adopting Multiple Gossip
Steps (MGS) for better model consistency, which accelerates the aggregation of
local flat models and better balances communication complexity and
generalization. Theoretically, we present improved convergence rates $\small
\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{T}+\frac{1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\lambda)^2}\big)$

\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\sqrt{KT}}+\frac{1}{T}+\frac{\lambda^Q+1}{K^{1/2}T^{3/2}(1-\lambda^Q)^2}\big)$

$1-\lambda$ is the spectral gap of gossip matrix and $Q$ is the number of MGS.
Empirically, our methods can achieve competitive performance compared with CFL

ZipLM identifies and removes redundancies in the model through iterative
structured shrinking of the model's weight matrices. Importantly, ZipLM works
in both, the post-training/one-shot and the gradual compression setting, where
it produces a set of accurate models in a single run, making it
highly-efficient in practice. Our approach is based on new structured pruning

multiple agents to reach the target goals in a limited time. Multi-agent

optimal policy in the large search space, which is exacerbated as the agent
number increases (e.g., 10+ agents) or the environment is more complex (e.g.,

provides a promising direction to tackle this challenge by introducing a
hierarchical structure to decompose the search space, where the low-level
policy predicts primitive actions in the guidance of the goals derived from the
high-level policy. In this paper, we propose Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced
Commander-Executor (MAGE-X), a graph-based goal-conditioned hierarchical method
for multi-agent navigation tasks. MAGE-X comprises a high-level Goal Commander
and a low-level Action Executor. The Goal Commander predicts the probability
distribution of goals and leverages them to assign each agent the most
appropriate final target. The Action Executor utilizes graph neural networks
(GNN) to construct a subgraph for each agent that only contains crucial
partners to improve cooperation. Additionally, the Goal Encoder in the Action
Executor captures the relationship between the agent and the designated goal to
encourage the agent to reach the final target. The results show that MAGE-X
outperforms the state-of-the-art MARL baselines with a 100% success rate with

630 nm in diameter, were cut from a piece of single crystal using a focused ion

self-heating $3\omega$ technique down to 80 K. Indeed, they reveal a reduction
of the room-temperature phonon thermal conductivity by a sizable fraction of
$\sim$40 % for our thinnest wire, thereby confirming our hypothesis.

such as data poisoning, require further (re)training or fine-tuning language

however diminishes the stealthiness of the attacks, as training a language

considerable modifications to the model parameters. In this work, we propose
Training-Free Lexical Backdoor Attack (TFLexAttack) as the first training-free
backdoor attack on language models. Our attack is achieved by injecting lexical
triggers into the tokenizer of a language model via manipulating its embedding
dictionary using carefully designed rules. These rules are explainable to human
developers which inspires attacks from a wider range of hackers. The sparse

independent entity. Auditors are asked to compute bias metrics that compare
outcomes for different groups, based on sex/gender and race/ethnicity

regression tasks (scenarios where the automated system scores candidates with a
continuous range of values). A previous version of the legislation proposed a
bias metric that compared the mean scores of different groups. The new revised
bias metric compares the proportion of candidates in each group that falls
above the median. In this paper, we argue that both metrics fail to capture
distributional differences over the whole domain, and therefore cannot reliably
detect bias. We first introduce two metrics, as possible alternatives to the
legislation metrics. We then compare these metrics over a range of theoretical
examples, for which the legislation proposed metrics seem to underestimate
bias. Finally, we study real data and show that the legislation metrics can
similarly fail in a real-world recruitment application.

for hyperspectral image compression using implicit neural representations where
a multilayer perceptron network $\Phi_\theta$ with sinusoidal activation
functions ``learns'' to map pixel locations to pixel intensities for a given
hyperspectral image $I$. $\Phi_\theta$ thus acts as a compressed encoding of
this image. The original image is reconstructed by evaluating $\Phi_\theta$ at

probably be able to observe neutrino signals associated with gravitational

Lorentz factor of the jets. Neutrino observations may enable us to constrain
the dissipation region of the jets. We apply this model to GRB 211211A, a

multiple confinements are investigated. Firstly, the motion of a single
skyrmion under spin transfer torque (STT) is studied. By accurately adjusting
the current pulse magnitude and width, the study reveals the possibility to pin
and stabilize the skyrmion in each confinement. Due to the Hall angle, the
depining of the skyrmion from the top confinement requires two pulses with
adjustable time delay while a single pulse is enough to depin it for the case
of bottom confinement. In the case of two skyrmions, once one is pinned in one
confinement, the second one stabilizes in the nearest available empty state and
no more than one skyrmion could be seen in single confinement. Finally and for
further confirmation of this behavior, the motion of a large number of
skyrmions is investigated under the same conditions. The results show that a
multistate device could be obtained with still the existence of only one
skyrmion per state. The skyrmions could be displaced along the nano-track until
their annihilation at the end of the device.

that share nuisance values (e.g. background) with in-distribution inputs. The
detection of shared-nuisance out-of-distribution (SN-OOD) inputs is
particularly relevant in real-world applications, as anomalies and
in-distribution inputs tend to be captured in the same settings during
deployment. In this work, we provide a possible explanation for SN-OOD
detection failures and propose nuisance-aware OOD detection to address them.
Nuisance-aware OOD detection substitutes a classifier trained via empirical
risk minimization and cross-entropy loss with one that 1. is trained under a
distribution where the nuisance-label relationship is broken and 2. yields
representations that are independent of the nuisance under this distribution,
both marginally and conditioned on the label. We can train a classifier to
achieve these objectives using Nuisance-Randomized Distillation (NuRD), an
algorithm developed for OOD generalization under spurious correlations. Output-
and feature-based nuisance-aware OOD detection perform substantially better
than their original counterparts, succeeding even when detection based on
domain generalization algorithms fails to improve performance.

unexplored and the occurrence rates of short-period Earth-sized planets around
late M dwarfs remain poorly constrained. Here, we present the deepest
photometric monitoring campaign of 22 nearby late M dwarf stars, using data
from over 500 nights on seven 1-2 meter class telescopes. Our survey includes
all known single quiescent northern late M dwarfs within 15 pc. We use
transit-injection-and-recovery tests to quantify the completeness of our
survey, successfully identify most ($>80\%$) transiting short-period (0.5-1 d)
super-Earths ($R > 1.9 R_\oplus$), and are sensitive ($\sim50\%$) to transiting
Earth-sized planets ($1.0-1.2 R_\oplus$). Our high sensitivity to transits with
a near-zero false positive rate demonstrates an efficient survey strategy. Our
survey does not yield a transiting planet detection, yet it provides the most
sensitive upper limits on transiting planets orbiting our target stars.
Finally, we explore multiple hypotheses about the occurrence rates of
short-period planets (from Earth-sized planets to giant planets) around late M

synthetic data is enormous. However, performance of networks trained with
synthetic data for certain computer vision tasks degrade significantly when

popular solutions in bridging this gap between synthetic and actual world data
is to frame it as a domain adaptation task. In this paper, we propose and
evaluate novel ways for the betterment of such approaches. In particular we
build upon the method of UNIT-GAN.
  In normal GAN training for the task of domain translation, pairing of images
from both the domains (viz, real and synthetic) is done randomly. We propose a
novel method to efficiently incorporate semantic supervision into this pair
selection, which helps in boosting the performance of the model along with
improving the visual quality of such transformed images. We illustrate our
empirical findings on Cityscapes \cite{cityscapes} and challenging synthetic

not enough to generate fine-grained captions. This paper exploits a
feature-compounding approach to bring together high-level semantic concepts and
visual information regarding the contextual environment fully end-to-end. Thus,
we propose a stacked cross-modal feature consolidation (SCFC) attention network
for image captioning in which we simultaneously consolidate cross-modal

fashion. Besides, we jointly employ spatial information and context-aware
attributes (CAA) as the principal components in our proposed compounding
function, where our CAA provides a concise context-sensitive semantic
representation. To make better use of consolidated features potential, we
further propose an SCFC-LSTM as the caption generator, which can leverage
discriminative semantic information through the caption generation process. The
experimental results indicate that our proposed SCFC can outperform various
state-of-the-art image captioning benchmarks in terms of popular metrics on the

method, this paper uses an OLS regression model to find more accurate
coefficients within the same Taylor Rule equation in which the dependent
variable is the federal funds rate, and the independent variables are the
inflation rate, the inflation gap, and the output gap. The intercept in the OLS
regression model would capture the constant equilibrium target real interest
rate set at 2. The linear OLS method suggests that the Taylor Rule
overestimates the output gap and standalone inflation rate's coefficients for
the Taylor Rule. The coefficients this paper suggests are shown in equation
(2). In the nonlinear method, this paper uses a machine learning system in
which the two inputs are the inflation rate and the output gap and the output
is the federal funds rate. This system utilizes gradient descent error
minimization to create a model that minimizes the error between the estimated
federal funds rate and the actual previously implemented federal funds rate.
Since the machine learning system allows the model to capture the more
realistic nonlinear relationship between the variables, it significantly
increases the estimation accuracy as a result. The actual and estimated federal
funds rates are almost identical besides three recessions caused by bubble
bursts, which the paper addresses in the concluding remarks. Overall, the first

  In this paper, we propose a novel DNN watermarking solution that can

this end, unlike previous methods relying on secret features learnt from

inputs from the original training dataset and fuse them as watermark triggers.
On the other hand, we randomly mask model weights during training so that the
information of our embedded watermarks spreads in the network. By doing so,
model fine-tuning/pruning would not forget our function-coupled watermarks.

diagrams. The complete Lagrangian of the standard model - without any
modification and including the Lagrangian of quantum chromodynamics - arises in
a natural manner.
  Over 90 experimental consequences and tests about quark and gluon behaviour
are deduced from the single fundamental principle. No consequence is in
contrast with observations. The consequences of the strand conjecture include
the complete quark model for hadrons, the correct sign of hadron quadrupole
moments, colour flux tubes, confinement, Regge behaviour, running quark masses,
correctly predicted hadron mass sequences, the lack of CP violation for the
strong interaction, asymptotic freedom, and the appearance of glueballs. Two
consequences differ from quantum chromodynamics. First, the geometry of the
strand process for the strong interaction leads to an ab-initio estimate for
the running strong coupling constant. Secondly, the tangle shapes lead to
ab-initio lower and upper limits for the mass values of the quarks.

emerge fully spatially coherent, causing inevitable damage to useful signals
during the suppression process. Various footprint removal methods, including
filtering and sparse representation (SR), have been reported to attain
promising results for surmounting this challenge. However, these methods, e.g.,
SR, rely solely on the handcrafted image priors of useful signals, which is
sometimes an unreasonable demand if complex geological structures are contained
in the given seismic data. As an alternative, this article proposes a footprint
removal network (dubbed FR-Net) for the unsupervised suppression of acquired
footprints without any assumptions regarding valuable signals. The key to the
FR-Net is to design a unidirectional total variation (UTV) model for footprint
acquisition according to the intrinsically directional property of noise. By
strongly regularizing a deep convolutional autoencoder (DCAE) using the UTV
model, our FR-Net transforms the DCAE from an entirely data-driven model to a
\textcolor{black}{prior-augmented} approach, inheriting the superiority of the
DCAE and our footprint model. Subsequently, the complete separation of the
footprint noise and useful signals is projected in an unsupervised manner,
specifically by optimizing the FR-Net via the backpropagation (BP) algorithm.
We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations conducted on three
synthetic and field datasets, demonstrating that our FR-Net surpasses the
previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

However, since they are highly data-driven, relying on billion-sized datasets

biases. To not only uncover but also combat these undesired effects, we present
a novel strategy, called Fair Diffusion, to attenuate biases after the
deployment of generative text-to-image models. Specifically, we demonstrate
shifting a bias, based on human instructions, in any direction yielding
arbitrarily new proportions for, e.g., identity groups. As our empirical
evaluation demonstrates, this introduced control enables instructing generative
image models on fairness, with no data filtering and additional training

generating engineering-relevant insights. Second, we design two such approaches
for benchmarking: one for feature attribution methods and one for feature

attribution/saliency methods and 9 feature synthesis methods. This approach
finds large differences in the capabilities of these existing tools and shows
significant room for improvement. Finally, we propose several directions for

from multiple tapered sections. The goal is to create a library of robust and
low-loss splitters covering all splitting ratios (SR) for our silicon photonics
platform based on 3 $\mu$m thick waveguides. The starting point is always a
non-tapered canonical MMI either with general symmetry (canonical SRs 50:50,
100:0, and reciprocal ratios), with mirror symmetric restricted symmetry
(canonical SRs 85:15, 50:50, 100:0, and reciprocal ratios), and with
point-symmetric restricted symmetry (canonical SRs 72:28 and 28:72). Splitters
of these three types are then divided into one to four subsections of equal
length, leading to 12 possible different configurations. In each of these
subsections, the width is first linearly tapered either up or down and then
tapered back to its starting value ensuring mirror symmetry. For all twelve
configurations, we carried out an extensive campaign of numerical simulations.
For each given width change, we scanned the splitter length and calculated the
power in the fundamental mode at the output as well as its relative phase. We
then selected the designs with sufficiently low loss and mapped their SR as a
function of either the change in width change or length, therefore creating
systematic maps for the design of MMI splitters with any SR. Eventually, we
selected and fabricated a subset of designs with SRs ranging from 5:95 to 95:5
in steps of 5% and validated their operation through optical measurements.

achieve unique properties of metamaterials that set them apart from
conventional materials. According to Neumann's principle, to achieve
anisotropic responses, the material unit cell should possess less symmetry.
Based on such guidelines, we present a triclinic metamaterial system of minimal
symmetry, which is originated from a Trimorph origami pattern with a simple and
insightful geometry: a basic unit cell with four tilted panels and four
corresponding creases. The intrinsic geometry of the Trimorph origami, with its
changing tilting angles, dictates a folding motion that varies the primitive
vectors of the unit cell, couples the shear and normal strains of its extrinsic
bulk, and leads to an unusual Poisson's effect. Such effect, associated to
reversible auxeticity in the changing triclinic frame, is observed
experimentally, and predicted theoretically by elegant math formulae. The
nonlinearities of the folding motions allow the unit cell to display three
robust stable states, connected through snapping instabilities. When the
tristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resembles linear and point
defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration. The frustration is
reprogrammable into distinct stable and inhomogeneous states by arbitrarily
selecting the location of a single or multiple point defects. The Trimorph
origami demonstrates the possibility of creating origami metamaterials with
symmetries that were hitherto non-existent, leading to triclinic metamaterials
with tunable anisotropy for potential applications such as wave propagation
control and compliant microrobots.

code will be. The paper describes J-Parallelio, the framework for automatic
analysis of the bytecode source codes and its parallelisation on multicore
processors. The process consists of a few steps. First step is a process of
decompilation of JVM and its translation to internal abstract syntax tree, the
dependency extraction and memory analysis is performed. Finally, the mapping
process is performed which consists of a set of rules responsible for
translating the input virtual machine source code to its parallel version. The
main novelty is that it can deal with pure Java virtual machine and can
generate parallel code for multicore processors. This makes the system portable
and it can work with different languages based on JVM after some small
modifications. The efficiency of automatically translated source codes were
compared with their manually written counterparts on chosen benchmarks.

asset to themselves to drive up market prices, launder money under the cover of
a legitimate transaction, or claim a tax loss without losing ownership of an
asset. Although the practice is illegal with traditional assets, lack of
supervision in the non-fungible token market enables criminals to wash trade
and scam unsuspecting buyers while operating under regulators radar. AnChain.AI
designed an algorithm that flags transactions within an NFT collection history
as wash trades when a wallet repurchases a token within 30 days of previously
selling it. The algorithm also identifies intermediate transactions within a
wash trade cycle. Testing on 7 popular NFT collections reveals that on average,
0.14% of transactions, 0.11% of wallets, and 0.16% of tokens in each collection
are involved in wash trading. These wash trades generate an overall total price
manipulation, sales, and repurchase profit of \$900K, \$1.1M, and negative
\$1.6M respectively. The results draw attention to the prevalent market
manipulation taking place and inform unsuspecting buyers which tokens and
sellers may be involved in criminal activity.

receptor is activated by a small peptide ligand neurotensin. NTSR1 can be
expressed in HEK cells by stable transfection. Previously we used the
fluorescent protein markers mRuby3 or mNeonGreen fused to NTSR1 for EMCCD-based
structured illumination microscopy (SIM) in living HEK cells. Ligand binding
induced conformational changes in NTSR1 which triggered the intracellular
signaling processes. Recent single-molecule studies revealed a dynamic
monomer/dimer equilibrium of this receptor in artificial lipid bilayers. Here
we report on the oligomerization state of human NTSR1 from living cells by
trapping them into lipid nanodiscs. Briefly, SMALPs (styrene-maleic acid
copolymer lipid nanoparticles) were produced directly from the plasma membranes
of living HEK293T FlpIn cells. SMALPs with a diameter of 15 nm were soluble and
stable. NTSR1 in SMALPs were analyzed by single-molecule intensity measurements
one membrane patch at a time using a custom-built confocal anti-Brownian
electrokinetic trap (ABEL trap) microscope. We found oligomerization changes
before and after stimulation of the receptor with its ligand neurotensin.

coupled with the standard model (SM) via a Higgs portal, so that the pNGB dark
matter is produced by the freeze-in mechanism. Since the production happened in
a very high energy era, we introduce an extra scalar field which is weakly
coupled to the SM for stablizing the electroweak vacuum. Our model can
reproduce the correct relic abundance of dark matter favored by observations.
In addition, we determine the evolution of couplings in higher energy scale by
solving the renormalization group equations, and show that the self coupling of
the real scalar, $\lambda_S$, and the mixing coupling between the Higgs field
and the real scalar, $\lambda_{HS}$ are stringently constrained by the
conditions of vacuum stability and couplings perturbativity up to the Planck

the refractive of the composite was 2.32 in the trans state and dropped to 1.85

model-based receiver algorithms to realize modular hybrid
model-based/data-driven architectures that can account for domain knowledge.
Such architectures typically include multiple modules, each carrying out a
different functionality. Conventionally trained DNN-based modules are known to
produce poorly calibrated, typically overconfident, decisions. This implies
that an incorrect decision may propagate through the architecture without any
indication of its insufficient accuracy. To address this problem, we present a
novel combination of Bayesian learning with hybrid model-based/data-driven
architectures for wireless receiver design. The proposed methodology, referred
to as modular model-based Bayesian learning, results in better calibrated
modules, improving accuracy and calibration of the overall receiver. We
demonstrate this approach for the recently proposed DeepSIC MIMO receiver,
showing significant improvements with respect to the state-of-the-art learning

  opinion formation models","8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study considers a variant of the bounded confidence opinion formation
model wherein the probability of opinion assimilation is dependent on the
relative similarity of opinions. Agents are located on a social network and
decide whether or not they adopt the opinion of one of the neighbors (called a
role agent). Opinion assimilation is more (less) likely to occur when the
distance from the opinion of the role agent is smaller (larger) than the
average opinion distance from other neighbors. Thus, assimilation probability
is reliant not only on opinion proximity with the role agent considered in
conventional models but also on relative similarity that considers other
neighbors. The simulation results demonstrate that large weights on relative
similarity in determining assimilation probability increase the size of the
largest opinion cluster. The size of the threshold parameter of the bounded
confidence model displays inverse-U relationships with the largest cluster
size. The findings imply that consideration of relative opinion similarity, as
observed in recent empirical studies, prevents polarization into small opinion
clusters.

and submillimetre astronomy instruments is a research area of high interest,
and with substantial engineering challenges. Alongside low-profile structure
and ultra-wideband performance in a wide range of angles of incidence, advanced
absorbers in CMB instruments are aimed at reducing optical systematics, notably
instrument polarisation, far beyond previous specifications. This paper
presents an innovative design of flat thin flexible absorber operating in a
wide frequency range of 80-400 GHz. The structure comprises a combination of
sub-wavelength metal-mesh capacitive and inductive grids and dielectric layers,
making use of the magnetic mirror concept for large bandwidth. The overall
stack thickness is a quarter of the longest operating wavelength and is close
to the theoretical limit stipulated by Rozanov criterion. The test device is
designed to operate at 22.5deg. incidence. The iterative numerical-experimental
design procedure of the new absorber is discussed in detail, as well as the
practical challenges of its manufacture. A well-established mesh-filter
fabrication process has been successfully employed for prototype fabrication,
which ensures cryogenic operation of the hot-pressed quasi-optical devices. The
final prototype, extensively tested in quasi-optical testbeds using a
Fourier-transform spectrometer and a vector network analyser, demonstrated
performance closely matching the finite-element analysis simulations, viz.,
greater than 99% absorbance for both polarisations, with only 0.2% difference,
across the frequency band of 80-400 GHz. The angular stability for up to
+/-10deg. has been confirmed by simulations. To the best of the authors
knowledge, this is the first successful implementation of a low-profile
ultrawideband metamaterial absorber for this frequency range and operating
conditions.

(2016), whose theory was used to describe steady-state resonant waves due to
time-harmonic container's elliptic orbits. In the limit of longitudinal
container motions, a symmetry-breaking of the planar wave solution occurs, with
clockwise and anti-clockwise swirling equally likely. In addition to this
primary harmonic dynamics, previous experiments have unveiled that diverse
super-harmonic dynamics are observable far from primary resonances. Among
these, the so-called double-crest (DC) dynamics, first observed by Reclari et
al. (2014) for rotary sloshing, is particularly relevant, as its manifestation
is the most favored by the spatial structure of the external driving. Following
Bongarzone et al. (2022a), in this work we develop a weakly nonlinear (WNL)
analysis to describe the system response to super-harmonic longitudinal
forcing. The resulting system of amplitude equations predicts that a planar
wave symmetry-breaking via stable swirling may also occur under super-harmonic
excitation. This finding is confirmed by our experimental observations, which
identify three possible super-harmonic regimes, i.e. (i) stable planar DC
waves, (ii) irregular motion and (iii) stable swirling DC waves, whose
corresponding stability boundaries in the forcing frequency-amplitude plane
quantitatively match the present theoretical estimates.

by an explicitly defined intensity function, which depends on the prior
knowledge of some specific tasks. Thus, designing a proper model is expensive
and time-consuming, with also limited ability to generalize well. To tackle
this problem, we adopt the convolutional recurrent neural network (conv-RNN) to
instantiate the point process, where its intensity function is automatically
modeled by the training data. Furthermore, we show that our method captures
both temporal and spatial evolution, which is essential in modeling events for
MOT. Experimental results demonstrate notable improvements in addressing noisy

performance is achieved by incorporating our baseline MOT algorithm with the
spatio-temporal point process model.

shortcoming of these algorithms is that they essentially fit a mixture of
identical spherical Gaussians to data that vastly deviates from such a
distribution. In comparison, general Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) can fit
richer structures but require estimating a quadratic number of parameters per
cluster to represent the covariance matrices. This poses two main issues: (i)
the underlying optimization problems are challenging due to their larger number
of local minima, and (ii) their solutions can overfit the data. In this work,
we design search strategies that circumvent both issues. We develop efficient
global optimization algorithms for general GMMs, and we combine these
algorithms with regularization strategies that avoid overfitting. Through
extensive computational analyses, we observe that global optimization or
regularization in isolation does not substantially improve cluster recovery.
However, combining these techniques permits a completely new level of
performance previously unachieved by k-means algorithm variants, unraveling
vastly different cluster structures. These results shed new light on the

In addition, existing inferential tools in online learning are mainly developed
for finite-dimensional problems, while inference methods for functional data
are focused on the batch learning setting. In this paper, we tackle these
issues by developing functional stochastic gradient descent algorithms and
proposing an online bootstrap resampling procedure to systematically study the
inference problem for functional linear regression. In particular, the proposed
estimation and inference procedures use only one pass over the data; thus they
are easy to implement and suitable to the situation where data arrive in a
streaming manner. Furthermore, we establish the convergence rate as well as the
asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimator. Meanwhile, the proposed
perturbed estimator from the bootstrap procedure is shown to enjoy the same
theoretical properties, which provide the theoretical justification for our
online inference tool. As far as we know, this is the first inference result on
the functional linear regression model with streaming data. Simulation studies
are conducted to investigate the finite-sample performance of the proposed
procedure. An application is illustrated with the Beijing multi-site
air-quality data.

for photocatalysis and water-spiting. However, weak light absorption in the
visible region of the spectrum poses stringent limitation to its practical
application. Doping of TiO2 with N or transition-metal impurities has been
explored to shift the onset of optical absorption to the visible region, yet
with limited success. Based on hybrid density functional calculations, we
propose adding Bi to TiO2, in the form of dilute Ti_(1-x)Bi_(x)O2 alloys, to
efficiently shift the optical absorption to the visible region. Compared to N,
Bi introduces an intermediate valence band that is significantly higher in the
band gap, and leaves the conduction band almost unchanged, leading to a
remarkable redshift in the absorption coefficient to cover almost all the
visible-light spectrum. Comparing formation enthalpies, our results show that
adding Bi costs significantly less energy than N in oxidizing conditions, and
that Ti_(1-x)Bi_(x)O2 might make a much more efficient photocatalyst than
TiO_(2-y)N_(y) for water splitting.

mid-infrared photonics and optoelectronics. However, despite the successful
demonstration of several Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$-based photodetectors and emitters,
key fundamental properties of this material system are yet to be fully explored
and understood. In particular, little is known about the role of the material
properties in controlling the recombination mechanisms and their consequences
on the carrier lifetime. Evaluating the latter is in fact fraught with large
uncertainties that are exacerbated by the difficulty to investigate narrow
bandgap semiconductors. To alleviate these limitations, herein we demonstrate
that the radiative carrier lifetime can be obtained from straightforward
excitation power- and temperature- dependent photoluminescence measurements. To
this end, a theoretical framework is introduced to simulate the measured
spectra by combining the band structure calculations from the k.p theory and
the envelope function approximation (EFA) to estimate the absorption and
spontaneous emission. Based on this model, the temperature-dependent emission
from Ge$_{0.83}$Sn$_{0.17}$ samples at a biaxial compressive strain of $-1.3\%$
was investigated. The simulated spectra reproduce accurately the measured data
thereby enabling the evaluation of the steady-state radiative carrier
lifetimes, which are found in the 3-22 ns range for temperatures between 10 and
300 K at an excitation power of 0.9 kW/cm$^2$. For a lower power of 0.07
kW/cm$^2$, the obtained lifetime has a value of 1.9 ns at 4 K. The demonstrated
approach yielding the radiative lifetime from simple emission spectra will
provide valuable inputs to improve the design and modeling of
Ge$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$-based devices.

traditional massaction models. However, the high-dimensionality of the exact
models poses a challenge to both mathematical analysis and parameter inference.
By using mean-field models, such as the pairwise model (PWM), the complexity
becomes tractable. While such models have been used extensively for model
analysis, there is limited work in the context of statistical inference. In
this paper, we explore the extent to which the PWM with the
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic can be used to infer disease- and
network-related parameters. The widely-used MLE approach exhibits several
issues pertaining to parameter unidentifiability and a lack of robustness to
exact knowledge about key quantities such as population size and/or proportion
of under reporting. As an alternative, we considered the recently developed
dynamical survival analysis (DSA). For scenarios in which there is no model
mismatch, such as when data are generated via simulations, both methods perform
well despite strong dependence between parameters. However, for real-world
data, such as foot-and-mouth, H1N1 and COVID19, the DSA method appears more
robust to potential model mismatch and the parameter estimates appear more
epidemiologically plausible. Taken together, however, our findings suggest that
network-based mean-field models can be used to formulate approximate
likelihoods which, coupled with an efficient inference scheme, make it possible
to not only learn about the parameters of the disease dynamics but also that of
the underlying network.

majority. Boolean functions are simply functions from $n$ bits to one bit, and
they can describe digital circuits, voting systems, etc. An example of a
Boolean function is majority, which returns the value that has majority among
the $n$ input bits for odd $n$. The complexity of a Boolean function $f$
measures the cost of evaluating it: how many bits of the input are needed to be
certain about the result of $f$. There are many competing complexity measures
but we focus on level-$p$-complexity -- a function of the probability $p$ that
a bit is 1. The level-$p$-complexity $D_p(f)$ is the minimum expected cost when
the input bits are independent and identically distributed with Bernoulli($p$)
distribution. We specify the problem as choosing the minimum expected cost of
all possible decision trees -- which directly translates to a clearly correct,
but very inefficient implementation. The library uses thinning and memoization
for efficiency and type classes for separation of concerns. The complexity is
represented using polynomials, and the order relation used for thinning is
implemented using polynomial factorisation and root-counting. Finally we
compute the complexity for two-level iterated majority and improve on an

the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can only deliver continuous DBS
(cDBS) stimuli at a fixed amplitude; this energy inefficient operation reduces
battery lifetime of the device, cannot adapt treatment dynamically for
activity, and may cause significant side-effects (e.g., gait impairment). In
this work, we introduce an offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework,
allowing the use of past clinical data to train an RL policy to adjust the
stimulation amplitude in real time, with the goal of reducing energy use while
maintaining the same level of treatment (i.e., control) efficacy as cDBS.
Moreover, clinical protocols require the safety and performance of such RL
controllers to be demonstrated ahead of deployments in patients. Thus, we also
introduce an offline policy evaluation (OPE) method to estimate the performance
of RL policies using historical data, before deploying them on patients. We
evaluated our framework on four PD patients equipped with the RC+S DBS system,
employing the RL controllers during monthly clinical visits, with the overall
control efficacy evaluated by severity of symptoms (i.e., bradykinesia and
tremor), changes in PD biomakers (i.e., local field potentials), and patient

controller maintains the same level of control efficacy as cDBS, but with
significantly reduced stimulation energy. Further, the OPE method is shown
effective in accurately estimating and ranking the expected returns of RL
controllers.

over online social networks. While detection and moderation of hate speech have
been the early go-to countermeasures, the solution requires a deeper
exploration of the dynamics of hate generation and propagation. We analyze more
than 32 million posts from over 6.8 million users across three popular online
social networks to investigate the interrelations between hateful behavior,
information dissemination, and polarised organization mediated by echo
chambers. We find that hatemongers play a more crucial role in governing the
spread of information compared to singled-out hateful content. This observation
holds for both the growth of information cascades as well as the conglomeration
of hateful actors. Dissection of the core-wise distribution of these networks
points towards the fact that hateful users acquire a more well-connected
position in the social network and often flock together to build up information
cascades. We observe that this cohesion is far from mere organized behavior;
instead, in these networks, hatemongers dominate the echo chambers -- groups of
users actively align themselves to specific ideological positions. The observed
dominance of hateful users to inflate information cascades is primarily via
user interactions amplified within these echo chambers. We conclude our study
with a cautionary note that popularity-based recommendation of content is
susceptible to be exploited by hatemongers given their potential to escalate
content popularity via echo-chambered interactions.

processes is key for the realization of high capacity optical quantum memories
and information processing devices. In this context, semiconductor quantum dots
placed in optical microcavities represent excellent candidates to explore
strong light-matter interactions beyond the limits of perturbative non-linear
optics and control the unitary evolution of optically driven quantum systems.
In this work, we demonstrate that a sequence of two optical picosecond pulses
can be used to establish coherent control over the phase evolution of the
ensemble of trions in (In,Ga)As quantum dots independent of their initial
quantum state. Our approach is based on coherent transfer between degenerate
multi-wave-mixing signals in the strong field limit where Rabi rotations in
multi-level systems take place. In particular, we use the two-pulse photon echo
sequence to uncover the coherent dynamics of the trion ensemble, whereas the
areas of two additional control pulses serve as tuning knobs for adjusting the
magnitude and timing of the coherent emission. Furthermore, we make use of the
spin degeneracy of ground and excited state of trions to control the
polarization state of the emitted signal. Surprisingly, we reveal that the use
of optical control pulses, whose durations are comparable to the dephasing time
of the ensemble, lifts the temporal degeneracy between wave-mixing processes of
different order. This phenomenon is manifested in a significant modification of
the temporal shape of the coherent optical response for strong optical fields.
Lifting the temporal degeneracy allows to smoothly trace the transition from
the perturbative to the regime of Rabi rotations and opens up new possibilities
for the optical investigation of complex energy level structures in so far
unexplored material systems.

capabilities. Their computational capabilities can be enhanced by computation
offloading in which required computation is to be done on a third-party server
on a cloud instead of the device itself. The cloud offers virtually infinite
computation and storage. We proposed that by exploiting parallelism within an
application call hierarchy we can decrease the execution time of off-loadable
parts and minimize data resend in case of VM crash. We determine function call
paths that are independent of each other within an application and schedule
each of them on separate VMs in a distributed way. Wherever such independent
paths merge, we collapse to a single VM and whenever the paths diverge again,
we schedule multiple VMs. If any single VM fails another copy will be created.
However, only the code and data associated with the crashed VM needs to be
re-transmitted from the client device. In the case of face reorganization
application and montage application we decrease execution time to 27.5% and
43.43% respectively. Whereas the data resend in case if any of both VMs crash
will be the portion of the application that had been offloaded to respective VM

states for the disease: absence, a new state meant to account for many zeroes
in some of the smaller areas, endemic and outbreak. Then we assume the disease
switches between the three states in each area through a series of coupled
nonhomogeneous hidden Markov chains. Unlike previous approaches, the transition
probabilities may depend on covariates and the occurrence of outbreaks in
neighboring areas, to account for geographical outbreak spread. Additionally,
to prevent rapid switching between endemic and outbreak periods we introduce
clone states into the model which enforce minimum endemic and outbreak
durations. We make some interesting findings such as that mobility in retail
and recreation venues had a strong positive association with the development
and persistence of new COVID-19 outbreaks in Quebec. Based on model comparison
our contributions show promise in improving state estimation retrospectively

increasingly important to find new tools to help mental health experts in
diagnosing mood disorders. Leaving aside the longcovid cognitive (e.g.,
difficulty in concentration) and bodily (e.g., loss of smell) effects, the
short-term covid effects on mental health were a significant increase in
anxiety and depressive symptoms. The aim of this study is to use a new tool,
the online handwriting and drawing analysis, to discriminate between healthy
individuals and depressed patients. To this aim, patients with clinical
depression (n = 14), individuals with high sub-clinical (diagnosed by a test
rather than a doctor) depressive traits (n = 15) and healthy individuals (n =
20) were recruited and asked to perform four online drawing /handwriting tasks
using a digitizing tablet and a special writing device. From the raw collected
online data, seventeen drawing/writing features (categorized into five
categories) were extracted, and compared among the three groups of the involved
participants, through ANOVA repeated measures analyses. Results shows that Time
features are more effective in discriminating between healthy and participants
with sub-clinical depressive characteristics. On the other hand, Ductus and
Pressure features are more effective in discriminating between clinical
depressed and healthy participants.

dataset that consists of time-stratified English Wikipedia snapshots from 2013

target entities' descriptions. By capturing such temporal aspects, our newly
introduced TempEL resource contrasts with currently existing entity linking
datasets, which are composed of fixed mentions linked to a single static
version of a target Knowledge Base (e.g., Wikipedia 2010 for CoNLL-AIDA).
Indeed, for each of our collected temporal snapshots, TempEL contains links to
entities that are continual, i.e., occur in all of the years, as well as
completely new entities that appear for the first time at some point. Thus, we
enable to quantify the performance of current state-of-the-art EL models for:
(i) entities that are subject to changes over time in their Knowledge Base
descriptions as well as their mentions' contexts, and (ii) newly created
entities that were previously non-existing (e.g., at the time the EL model was
trained). Our experimental results show that in terms of temporal performance
degradation, (i) continual entities suffer a decrease of up to 3.1% EL
accuracy, while (ii) for new entities this accuracy drop is up to 17.9%. This
highlights the challenge of the introduced TempEL dataset and opens new
research prospects in the area of time-evolving entity disambiguation.

TPO schedules from workflow logs, which include events along with their time

augmentations of training data or through unsupervised pretraining of a single
large model on massive in-the-wild training datasets scraped from the Internet.
However, the notion of a dataset is also undergoing a paradigm shift in recent
years. With drastic improvements in the quality, ease-of-use, and access to
modern generative models, generated data is pervading the web. In this light,
we study the question: How do these generated datasets influence the natural
robustness of image classifiers? We find that Imagenet classifiers trained on
real data augmented with generated data achieve higher accuracy and effective
robustness than standard training and popular augmentation strategies in the
presence of natural distribution shifts. We analyze various factors influencing
these results, including the choice of conditioning strategies and the amount
of generated data. Additionally, we find that the standard ImageNet classifiers
suffer a performance degradation of upto 20\% on the generated data, indicating
their fragility at accurately classifying the objects under novel variations.
Lastly, we demonstrate that the image classifiers, which have been trained on
real data augmented with generated data from the base generative model, exhibit
greater resilience to natural distribution shifts compared to the classifiers
trained on real data augmented with generated data from the finetuned

approach to address highly undersampled acquisitions by incorporating motion

framework to address the MCMR problem efficiently. Contrary to state-of-the-art
(SOTA) MCMR methods which break the original problem into two sub-optimization
problems, i.e. motion estimation and reconstruction, we formulate this problem
as a single entity with one single optimization. We discard the canonical
motion-warping loss (similarity measurement between motion-warped images and
target images) to estimate the motion, but drive the motion estimation process
directly by the final reconstruction performance. The higher reconstruction
quality is achieved without using any smoothness loss terms and without
iterative processing between motion estimation and reconstruction. Therefore,
we avoid non-trivial loss weighting factors tuning and time-consuming iterative
processing. Experiments on 43 in-house acquired 2D CINE datasets indicate that
the proposed MCMR framework can deliver artifact-free motion estimation and
high-quality MR images even for imaging accelerations up to 20x. The proposed
framework is compared to SOTA non-MCMR and MCMR methods and outperforms these
methods qualitatively and quantitatively in all applied metrics across all

complex scheduling problem that is able to model many manufacturing planning
and logistics applications realistically by addressing both the lack of storage
capacity and unforeseen production interruptions. Subjected to random
disruptions due to machine malfunction or maintenance, industry production
settings often choose to adopt dispatching rules to enable adaptive, real-time
re-scheduling, rather than traditional methods that require costly
re-computation on the new configuration every time the problem condition
changes dynamically. To generate dispatching rules for the ISBJSSP problem, a
method that uses graph neural networks and reinforcement learning is proposed.
ISBJSSP is formulated as a Markov decision process. Using proximal policy
optimization, an optimal scheduling policy is learnt from randomly generated
instances. Employing a set of reported benchmark instances, we conduct a
detailed experimental study on ISBJSSP instances with a range of machine
shutdown probabilities to show that the scheduling policies generated can
outperform or are at least as competitive as existing dispatching rules with
predetermined priority. This study shows that the ISBJSSP, which requires
real-time adaptive solutions, can be scheduled efficiently with the proposed
machine learning method when production interruptions occur with random machine
shutdowns.

relationship, especially long-range electrode dependencies across the scalp,
may be underutilized by GCNs, although such relationships have been proven to
be important in emotion recognition. The small receptive field makes shallow
GCNs only aggregate local nodes. On the other hand, stacking too many layers
leads to over-smoothing. To solve these problems, we propose the pyramidal
graph convolutional network (PGCN), which aggregates features at three levels:
local, mesoscopic, and global. First, we construct a vanilla GCN based on the
3D topological relationships of electrodes, which is used to integrate
two-order local features; Second, we construct several mesoscopic brain regions
based on priori knowledge and employ mesoscopic attention to sequentially
calculate the virtual mesoscopic centers to focus on the functional connections
of mesoscopic brain regions; Finally, we fuse the node features and their 3D
positions to construct a numerical relationship adjacency matrix to integrate
structural and functional connections from the global perspective. Experimental
results on three public datasets indicate that PGCN enhances the relationship
modelling across the scalp and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both

enhance the segmentation performance. However, existing approaches are
oblivious to partial common information shared by subsets of the modalities. In
this paper, we show that identifying such partial common information can
significantly boost the discriminative power of image segmentation models. In
particular, we introduce a novel concept of partial common information mask
(PCI-mask) to provide a fine-grained characterization of what partial common
information is shared by which subsets of the modalities. By solving a masked
correlation maximization and simultaneously learning an optimal PCI-mask, we
identify the latent microstructure of partial common information and leverage
it in a self-attention module to selectively weight different feature
representations in multi-modal data. We implement our proposed framework on the
standard U-Net. Our experimental results on the Multi-modal Brain Tumor
Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) datasets consistently outperform those of
state-of-the-art segmentation baselines, with validation Dice similarity
coefficients of 0.920, 0.897, 0.837 for the whole tumor, tumor core, and

(DOb) to suppress disturbances, such as friction and hysteresis, in an

controllers are always implemented using computers and/or microcontrollers,
this paper proposes a stability analysis in the discrete-time domain. It is
shown that the bandwidth of the DOb is limited not only by the noise of
velocity measurement but also by the waterbed effect. It is also shown that the
stability of the robust force controller may significantly deteriorate when the
design parameters of the RTOb are not properly tuned. For example, the robust
force controller may have a non-minimum phase zero(s) as the design parameter
of the identified inertia (torque coefficient) of the RTOb is increased

feature disentanglement and produces consistent predictions for samples with
arbitrary rotations. Specifically, we design a siamese training module which
disentangles rotation invariance and equivariance from patches defined over
different scales, e.g., the local geometry and global shape, via a pair of
rotations. However, our disentangled invariant feature loses the intrinsic pose
information of each patch. To solve this problem, we propose a
rotation-invariant geometric relation to restore the relative pose with
equivariant information for patches defined over different scales. Utilising
the pose information, we propose a hierarchical module which implements
intra-scale and inter-scale feature aggregation for 3D shape learning.
Moreover, we introduce a pose-aware feature propagation process with the
rotation-invariant relative pose information embedded. Experiments show that

new results and methods for solving the problem. In doing so, we discuss the
main challenges associated with solving the VRPSD under the chance-constraint

state-of-the-art, we introduce two major methodological contributions. First,
we present a branch-price-and-cut (BP&C) algorithm for the VRPSD under optimal

compares favorably with previous algorithms and allows the solution of several
open benchmark instances. Second, we develop a demand model for dealing with
correlated customer demands. The central concept in this model is the ""external

present a Bayesian-based, iterated learning procedure to refine our knowledge
about the external factor as customer demands are revealed. This updated
knowledge is then used to prescribe optimal replenishment decisions under
demand correlation. Computational results demonstrate the efficiency of the new
BP&C method and show that cost savings above 10% may be achieved when
restocking decisions take account of demand correlation. Lastly, we motivate a
few research perspectives that, as we believe, should shape future research on

repulsive, frictionless disks with either positive or negative global shear
moduli. We carry out computational studies to understand the contributions of
the negative shear moduli to the mechanical response of jammed disk packings.
We first decompose the ensemble-averaged, global shear modulus as $\langle
G\rangle = (1-{\cal F}_-) \langle G_+ \rangle + {\cal F}_- \langle G_-\rangle$,
where ${\cal F}_-$ is the fraction of jammed packings with negative shear
moduli and $\langle G_+\rangle$ and $\langle G_-\rangle$ are the average values
from packings with positive and negative moduli, respectively. We show that
$\langle G_+\rangle$ and $\langle|G_-|\rangle$ obey different power-law scaling
relations above and below $pN^2 \sim 1$. We then calculate analytically that
${\cal P}(G)$ is a Gamma distribution in the $pN^2 \ll 1$ limit. As $pN^2$
increases, the skewness of ${\cal P}(G)$ decreases and ${\cal P}(G)$ becomes a
skew-normal distribution with negative skewness in the $pN^2 \gg 1$ limit. We
also partition jammed disk packings into subsystems using Delanunay
triangulation of the disk centers to calculate local shear moduli. We show that
the local shear moduli defined from groups of adjacent triangles can be
negative even when $G > 0$. The spatial correlation function of local shear
moduli $C({\vec r})$ displays weak correlations for $pn_{\rm sub}^2 < 10^{-2}$,
where $n_{\rm sub}$ is the number of particles within each subsystem. However,
$C({\vec r})$ begins to develop long-ranged spatial correlations with four-fold
angular symmetry for $pn_{\rm sub}^2 \gtrsim 10^{-2}$.

Adaptation (GDA), which involves transferring a pre-trained generator from one

human brains acquire knowledge in new domains, we present an innovative
generator structure called Domain Re-Modulation (DoRM). DoRM not only meets the
criteria of high quality, large synthesis diversity, and cross-domain
consistency, which were achieved by previous research in GDA, but also
incorporates memory and domain association, akin to how human brains operate.
Specifically, DoRM freezes the source generator and introduces new mapping and
affine modules (M&A modules) to capture the attributes of the target domain
during GDA. This process resembles the formation of new synapses in human
brains. Consequently, a linearly combinable domain shift occurs in the style
space. By incorporating multiple new M&A modules, the generator gains the
capability to perform high-fidelity multi-domain and hybrid-domain generation.
Moreover, to maintain cross-domain consistency more effectively, we introduce a
similarity-based structure loss. This loss aligns the auto-correlation map of
the target image with its corresponding auto-correlation map of the source
image during training. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
superior performance of our DoRM and similarity-based structure loss in

pose issues when class labels are coarsely-defined and are uninformative. We
propose Classification with Hierarchical Label Sets (or CHiLS), an alternative

by querying GPT-3; (ii) perform the standard zero-shot CLIP procedure as though
these subclasses were the labels of interest; (iii) map the predicted subclass
back to its parent to produce the final prediction. Across numerous datasets

machine learning. One fundamental situation is the \emph{covariate shift},

while the input-conditional output distribution remains unchanged. In this
paper, we initiate the study of a more challenging scenario --
\emph{continuous} covariate shift -- in which the test data appear
sequentially, and their distributions can shift continuously. Our goal is to
adaptively train the predictor such that its prediction risk accumulated over

the method works effectively if the time-varying density ratios of test and
train inputs can be accurately estimated. However, existing density ratio
estimation methods would fail due to data scarcity at each time step. To this
end, we propose an online method that can appropriately reuse historical

enjoying a dynamic regret bound, which finally leads to an excess risk
guarantee for the predictor. Empirical results also validate the effectiveness.

investigation of the transient evolution of the band structure after
photo-excitation, but additional information on the dynamics of the concomitant
lattice rearrangement is needed to fully understand this phenomenon. Here,
ultrafast electron diffraction is used to probe the atomic motion and bond
dilation in monolayer WSe2 with femtosecond temporal resolution. The change in
the intensity of the Bragg diffraction spots is characterized by
single-exponential dynamics, consistent with a collective response of the
lattice during electron-phonon and phonon-phonon equilibration that is
repeatable over many hours of illumination with ultrafast pulses. Moreover, a
transient and highly anisotropic lattice expansion is observed. A possible
explanation for this behavior is axial strain induced by the laser excitation
that breaks the degeneracy of the in-plane phonon modes, and that strongly
influences the electronic band structure. Such degeneracy-breaking induced by
distortions in the lattice are well characterized in static strain
measurements, and the results presented here provide valuable insights into the
nature and time scales of the structural rearrangement that occurs following
optical photo-excitation in monolayer tungsten diselenide.

the rapid development of new high-performance compounds. Recently, several deep
generative models have been proposed to suggest candidate compounds that are
expected to satisfy the desired performance. However, they usually have the
problem of requiring a large amount of experimental datasets for training to
achieve sufficient accuracy. In actual cases, it is often possible to
accumulate only about 1000 experimental data at most. Therefore, the authors
proposed a deep generative model with nested two variational autoencoders
(VAEs). The outer VAE learns the structural features of compounds using
large-scale public data, while the inner VAE learns the relationship between
the latent variables of the outer VAE and the properties from small-scale
experimental data. To generate high performance compounds beyond the range of
the training data, the authors also proposed a loss function that amplifies the
correlation between a component of latent variables of the inner VAE and
material properties. The results indicated that this loss function contributes
to improve the probability of generating high-performance candidates.
Furthermore, as a result of verification test with an actual customer in
chemical industry, it was confirmed that the proposed method is effective in
reducing the number of experiments to $1/4$ compared to a conventional method.

Briefly, a low-temporal-high-spatial resolution organization of the acquired

  Multi-task Graph Neural Topology Search","Submitted to IEEE TEVC",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The construction of machine learning models involves many bi-level
multi-objective optimization problems (BL-MOPs), where upper level (UL)
candidate solutions must be evaluated via training weights of a model in the
lower level (LL). Due to the Pareto optimality of sub-problems and the complex
dependency across UL solutions and LL weights, an UL solution is feasible if
and only if the LL weight is Pareto optimal. It is computationally expensive to
determine which LL Pareto weight in the LL Pareto weight set is the most
appropriate for each UL solution. This paper proposes a bi-level
multi-objective learning framework (BLMOL), coupling the above decision-making
process with the optimization process of the UL-MOP by introducing LL
preference $r$. Specifically, the UL variable and $r$ are simultaneously
searched to minimize multiple UL objectives by evolutionary multi-objective
algorithms. The LL weight with respect to $r$ is trained to minimize multiple
LL objectives via gradient-based preference multi-objective algorithms. In
addition, the preference surrogate model is constructed to replace the
expensive evaluation process of the UL-MOP. We consider a novel case study on
multi-task graph neural topology search. It aims to find a set of Pareto
topologies and their Pareto weights, representing different trade-offs across
tasks at UL and LL, respectively. The found graph neural network is employed to
solve multiple tasks simultaneously, including graph classification, node
classification, and link prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that
BLMOL can outperform some state-of-the-art algorithms and generate
well-representative UL solutions and LL weights.

fooling natural language processing models. However, the fundamental questions
of why these attacks are effective, and the intrinsic properties of the
adversarial examples (AEs), are still not well understood. This work attempts
to interpret textual attacks through the lens of $n$-gram frequency.
Specifically, it is revealed that existing word-level attacks exhibit a strong
tendency toward generation of examples with $n$-gram frequency descend
($n$-FD). Intuitively, this finding suggests a natural way to improve model
robustness by training the model on the $n$-FD examples. To verify this idea,
we devise a model-agnostic and gradient-free AE generation approach that relies
solely on the $n$-gram frequency information, and further integrate it into the
recently proposed convex hull framework for adversarial training. Surprisingly,
the resultant method performs quite similarly to the original gradient-based
method in terms of model robustness. These findings provide a
human-understandable perspective for interpreting word-level textual
adversarial attacks, and a new direction to improve model robustness.

their coefficients of variation change according to the different DFC
mesostructures. To understand the relationship between material morphology at
the mesoscale and corresponding material properties, we developed a random
platelet mesostructure generation algorithm combined with explicit finite

about 45 layers through the thickness for the narrow platelets and 27 layers

each phrase of the parsing has a previous occurrence, with the additional
constraint that the previous occurrence must end at the end of a previous
phrase. LZ-End was initially proposed as a greedy parsing, where each phrase is
determined greedily from left to right, as the longest factor that satisfies
the above constraint~[Kreft & Navarro, 2010]. In this work, we consider an
optimal LZ-End parsing that has the minimum number of phrases in such parsings.
We show that a decision version of computing the optimal LZ-End parsing is
NP-complete by showing a reduction from the vertex cover problem. Moreover, we
give a MAX-SAT formulation for the optimal LZ-End parsing adapting an approach
for computing various NP-hard repetitiveness measures recently presented by
[Bannai et al., 2022]. We also consider the approximation ratio of the size of
greedy LZ-End parsing to the size of the optimal LZ-End parsing, and give a
lower bound of the ratio which asymptotically approaches $2$.

propose a joint scattering environment sensing and channel estimation scheme to
enhance the target/scatterer localization and channel estimation performance
simultaneously, where a spatially non-stationary Markov random field (MRF)
model is proposed to capture the 2-D joint burst sparsity. Specifically, the
base station (BS) first transmits downlink pilots to sense the targets in the
scattering environment. Then the user transmits uplink pilots to estimate the
communication channel. Finally, joint scattering environment sensing and
channel estimation are performed at the BS based on the reflected downlink
pilot signal and received uplink pilot signal. A message passing based
algorithm is designed based on the turbo approach. Furthermore, a variation of
the expectation maximization method, based on pseudo-likelihood approximation,
is proposed to learn the unknown parameters in the non-stationary MRF model

advantages of our proposed scheme are verified in the simulations.

learning paradigm but suffers from high communication cost when training
large-scale machine learning models. Sign-based methods, such as SignSGD
\cite{bernstein2018signsgd}, have been proposed as a biased gradient
compression technique for reducing the communication cost. However, sign-based
algorithms could diverge under heterogeneous data, which thus motivated the
development of advanced techniques, such as the error-feedback method and
stochastic sign-based compression, to fix this issue. Nevertheless, these
methods still suffer from slower convergence rates. Besides, none of them
allows multiple local SGD updates like FedAvg \cite{mcmahan2017communication}.
In this paper, we propose a novel noisy perturbation scheme with a general
symmetric noise distribution for sign-based compression, which not only allows
one to flexibly control the tradeoff between gradient bias and convergence
performance, but also provides a unified viewpoint to existing stochastic
sign-based methods. More importantly, the unified noisy perturbation scheme
enables the development of the very first sign-based FedAvg algorithm
($z$-SignFedAvg) to accelerate the convergence. Theoretically, we show that
$z$-SignFedAvg achieves a faster convergence rate than existing sign-based
methods and, under the uniformly distributed noise, can enjoy the same
convergence rate as its uncompressed counterpart. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate that the $z$-SignFedAvg can achieve competitive
empirical performance on real datasets and outperforms existing schemes.

  Preloaded Ads","The first two authors contributed equally",,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  To increase brand awareness, many advertisers conclude contracts with
advertising platforms to purchase traffic and then deliver advertisements to
target audiences. In a whole delivery period, advertisers usually desire a
certain impression count for the ads, and they also expect that the delivery
performance is as good as possible (e.g., obtaining high click-through rate).
Advertising platforms employ pacing algorithms to satisfy the demands via
adjusting the selection probabilities to traffic requests in real-time.
However, the delivery procedure is also affected by the strategies from
publishers, which cannot be controlled by advertising platforms. Preloading is
a widely used strategy for many types of ads (e.g., video ads) to make sure
that the response time for displaying after a traffic request is legitimate,
which results in delayed impression phenomenon. Traditional pacing algorithms
cannot handle the preloading nature well because they rely on immediate
feedback signals, and may fail to guarantee the demands from advertisers.
  In this paper, we focus on a new research problem of impression pacing for
preloaded ads, and propose a Reinforcement Learning To Pace framework RLTP. It
learns a pacing agent that sequentially produces selection probabilities in the
whole delivery period. To jointly optimize the two objectives of impression
count and delivery performance, RLTP employs tailored reward estimator to
satisfy the guaranteed impression count, penalize the over-delivery and
maximize the traffic value. Experiments on large-scale industrial datasets
verify that RLTP outperforms baseline pacing algorithms by a large margin. We
have deployed the RLTP framework online to our advertising platform, and
results show that it achieves significant uplift to core metrics including
delivery completion rate and click-through rate.

October-November after a series of short, normal outbursts with increasing

UMa stars and this observation strengthened the suggestion that the
accumulating mass and angular momentum in the disk during repeated normal
outbursts caused a superoutburst even in the unusual system BO Cet. The
outburst just preceding the superoutburst bore characteristics of an IW
And-type standstill. This phenomenon reinforces the suggestion that the
terminal outburst in IW And stars occurs when the disk radius reaches a certain
limit. I consider that this outburst was a failed superoutburst, during which
the disk reached the radius of the 3:1 resonance but the outburst faded before
superhumps developed. In BO Cet with a mass ratio on the borderline of the
stability of the 3:1 resonance, there may have been a competition between the
effects of tidal truncation and the 3:1 resonance as the disk radius grew and
the latter won in the current case. This finding in BO Cet might suggest that
IW And-type and SU UMa-type phenomena are more strongly physically related than

  Learning and Deep Autoregressive Network",,,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Subsurface earth models (referred to as geo-models) are crucial for
characterizing complex subsurface systems. Multiple-point statistics are
commonly used to generate geo-models. In this paper, a deep-learning-based
generative method is developed as an alternative to the traditional Geomodel
generation procedure. The generative method comprises two deep-learning models,
namely the hierarchical vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE-2) and
PixelSNAIL autoregressive model. Based on the principle of neural discrete
representation learning, the VQ-VAE-2 learns to massively compress the
Geomodels to extract the low-dimensional, discrete latent representation
corresponding to each Geomodel. Following that, PixelSNAIL uses the deep
autoregressive network to learn the prior distribution of the latent codes. For
the purpose of Geomodel generation, PixelSNAIL samples from the newly learned
prior distribution of latent codes, and then the decoder of the VQ-VAE-2
converts the newly sampled latent code to a newly constructed geo-model.
PixelSNAIL can be used for unconditional or conditional geo-model generation.
In an unconditional generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble
of geo-models without any constraint. On the other hand, in the conditional
geo-model generation, the generative workflow generates an ensemble of
geo-models similar to a user-defined source image, which ultimately facilitates
the control and manipulation of the generated geo-models. To better construct
the fluvial channels in the geo-models, the perceptual loss is implemented in
the VQ-VAE-2 model instead of the traditional mean squared error loss. At a
specific compression ratio, the quality of multi-attribute geo-model generation
is better than that of single-attribute geo-model generation.

and magnetic fields in organic superconductors
$\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$Cu[N(CN)$_{2}$]Br. The lower critical field and upper
critical field are determined, which allow to depict a complete phase diagram.
Through the comparison between the upper critical fields with magnetic field
perpendicular and parallel to the conducting ac-planes, and the scaling of the
in-plane resistivity with field along different directions, we found that the
anisotropy $\Gamma$ is strongly temperature dependent. It is found that
$\Gamma$ is quite large (above 20) near $T_{c}$, which satisfies the 2D model,
but approaches a small value in the low-temperature region. The 2D-Tinkham
model can also be used to fit the data at high temperatures. This is explained
as a crossover from the orbital depairing mechanism in high-temperature and
low-field region to the paramagnetic depairing mechanism in the high-field and
low-temperature region. The temperature dependence of lower critical field
$H_{c1} (T)$ shows a concave shape in wide temperature region. It is found that
neither a single $d$-wave nor a single $s$-wave gap can fit the $H_{c1} (T)$,
however a two-gap model containing an $s$-wave and a $d$-wave can fit the data
rather well, suggesting two-band superconductivity and an unconventional
pairing mechanism in this organic superconductor.

better than deep neural networks (DNNs) on small datasets. The interest in

of DNNs is their ability to scale the model size and training data size
independently, whereas in traditional kernel machines model size is tied to
data size. Because of this coupling, scaling kernel machines to large data has
been computationally challenging. In this paper, we provide a way forward for
constructing large-scale general kernel models, which are a generalization of
kernel machines that decouples the model and data, allowing training on large

framework uses the (expensive) gradient computation to construct surrogate
functions in a \emph{target space} (e.g. the logits output by a linear model

parameter updates to the model, amortizing the cost of gradient computation. In
the full-batch setting, we prove that our surrogate is a global upper-bound on
the loss, and can be (locally) minimized using a black-box optimization
algorithm. We prove that the resulting majorization-minimization algorithm
ensures convergence to a stationary point of the loss. Next, we instantiate our
framework in the stochastic setting and propose the $SSO$ algorithm, which can
be viewed as projected stochastic gradient descent in the target space. This
connection enables us to prove theoretical guarantees for $SSO$ when minimizing
convex functions. Our framework allows the use of standard stochastic
optimization algorithms to construct surrogates which can be minimized by any
deterministic optimization method. To evaluate our framework, we consider a

transmission is reduced to 2% of that without transmission control while
preserving the performance on the HAR task.

perform poorly during the test stage if the test distribution differs from the

approaches that aim to learn a single model that is domain invariant, D^3G
learns domain-specific models by leveraging the relations among different

during the training stage and reweights them based on domain relations during
the test stage. These domain relations can be directly derived or learned from
fixed domain meta-data. Under mild assumptions, we theoretically proved that
using domain relations to reweight training-domain-specific functions achieves
stronger generalization compared to averaging them. Empirically, we evaluated
the effectiveness of D^3G using both toy and real-world datasets for tasks such

a small region of the $H$-$T$ phase diagram. Here, we describe a simple and
versatile approach based on the differential thermal expansion between
dissimilar materials to subject a thin single crystalline MoTe$_2$ to biaxial

five-fold and consequently expand the superconducting region on the $H$-$T$

superconductivity in the biaxially strained MoTe$_2$, we further present the
magnetotransport data, enabling the study of the temperature-dependent $H_{c2}$

difficult to obtain in a free-standing MoTe$_2$. Our work shows that biaxial

boosting (CB) to identify COVID-19 infected CT slices in the first stage. Each
STM block extracts boundary and region-smoothing-specific features for COVID-19

introducing the new CB and Transfer Learning (TL) concept in STM blocks to
capture small illumination and texture variations of COVID-19-specific images.
The COVID-19 CTs are provided with new SA-CB-BRSeg segmentation CNN for
delineating infection in images in the second stage. SA-CB-BRSeg methodically
utilized smoothening and heterogeneous operations in the encoder and decoder to
capture simultaneously COVID-19 specific patterns that are region homogeneity,
texture variation, and boundaries. Additionally, the new CB concept is
introduced in the decoder of SA-CB-BRSeg by combining additional channels using
TL to learn the low contrast region. The proposed STM-BRNet and SA-CB-BRSeg

polarizations at BESIII opens a new window for testing CP violation, as it
allows for simultaneous production and detection of hyperon and anti-hyperon
pair two-body weak decays. The CP-symmetry tests can be performed in processes
like e.g. $J/\psi\to\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$,
$J/\psi,\psi'\to\Sigma^+\bar{\Sigma}^-$ and $J/\psi\to\Xi^-\bar{\Xi}^+$. For
the $\Xi^-\to\Lambda\pi^-$ decay it is possible to perform three independent CP
tests and determine the strong phase and weak phase difference.

In this paper, we develop a dynamic theory of wireless power transfer between

possibility to realize efficient wireless power transfer at large distances
utilizing the regime of radiation suppression due to optimized mutual dynamic

to solve fractional diffusion equations. In the general spatial error analyses,
an assumption $u\in C^{4}(\bar{\Omega})$ is needed to preserve
$\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$ convergence when using central finite difference scheme to
solve fractional sub-diffusion equation with Laplace operator, but this
assumption is somewhat strong, where $u$ is the exact solution and $h$ is the
mesh size. In this paper, a novel analysis technique is proposed to show that
the spatial convergence rate can reach
$\mathcal{O}(h^{\min(\sigma+\frac{1}{2}-\epsilon,2)})$ in both $l^{2}$-norm and
$l^{\infty}$-norm in one-dimensional domain when the initial value and source
term are both in $\hat{H}^{\sigma}(\Omega)$ but without any regularity
assumption on the exact solution, where $\sigma\geq 0$ and $\epsilon>0$ being
arbitrarily small. After making slight modifications on the scheme, acting on
the initial value and source term, the spatial convergence rate can be improved
to $\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$ in $l^{2}$-norm and
$\mathcal{O}(h^{\min(\sigma+\frac{3}{2}-\epsilon,2)})$ in $l^{\infty}$-norm.
It's worth mentioning that our spatial error analysis is applicable to high
dimensional cube domain by using the properties of tensor product. Moreover,
two kinds of averaged schemes are provided to approximate the
Riemann--Liouville fractional derivative, and $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{2})$
convergence is obtained for all $\alpha\in(0,1)$. Finally, some numerical
experiments verify the effectiveness of the built theory.

progress, it still lacks the consideration of cross-scenario relations, thus
leading to limitation in learning capability and difficulty in interrelation
modeling. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Contrastive Constrained approach
(HC^2) for multi-scenario ad ranking. To enhance the modeling of data
interrelation, we elaborately design a hybrid contrastive learning approach to
capture commonalities and differences among multiple scenarios. The core of our
approach consists of two elaborated contrastive losses, namely generalized and
individual contrastive loss, which aim at capturing common knowledge and
scenario-specific knowledge, respectively. To adapt contrastive learning to the
complex multi-scenario setting, we propose a series of important improvements.
For generalized contrastive loss, we enhance contrastive learning by extending
the contrastive samples (label-aware and diffusion noise enhanced contrastive
samples) and reweighting the contrastive samples (reciprocal similarity
weighting). For individual contrastive loss, we use the strategies of
dropout-based augmentation and {cross-scenario encoding} for generating
meaningful positive and negative contrastive samples, respectively. Extensive
experiments on both offline evaluation and online test have demonstrated the
effectiveness of the proposed HC$^2$ by comparing it with a number of
competitive baselines.

skyrmionic cocoons have been successfully stabilized in magnetic multilayers
having a variable thickness of the ferromagnet in the vertical direction of the
stack. These ellipsoidal 3D magnetic textures remain vertically confined in a
fraction of the total thickness while coexisting with fully columnar skyrmions.
Here, we use X-ray holography with about 15 nm lateral resolution to
investigate how their properties depend on the field and temperature. We
observe circular objects with different amplitude of contrast which evidences
the presence of different 3D objects located in various vertical parts of the
multilayer. Moreover, we witness during out-of-plane cycling an attractive
interaction between cocoons located at various heights, mainly due to the stray
field, which impacts their horizontal positioning. The X-ray holography
measurements also allow to determine the size of the cocoons at remanence
which, at room temperature, possess diameter close to 100 nm in average.
Combining this transmission technique with magnetic force microscopy and
micromagnetic simulations gives a precise insight into the 3D distribution of
the magnetization which demonstrate the 3D nature of skyrmionic cocoons.

The detection of the gravitational wave memory can be used to test general

Quantitative model is important for such detection and signal interpretation.
Previous works on gravitational wave memory always use the energy flux of
gravitational wave to calculate memory. Such relation between gravitational
wave energy and memory has only been validated for post-Newtonian
approximation. The result of numerical relativity about gravitational wave
memory is not confident yet. Accurately calculating memory is highly demanded.
Here we propose a new method to calculate the gravitational wave memory. This
method is based on Bondi-Metzner-Sachs theory. Consequently our method does not
need slow motion and weak field conditions for gravitational wave source. Our
new method can accurately calculate memory if the non-memory waveform is known.
As an example, we combine our method with matured numerical relativity result
about non-memory waveform for binary black hole coalescence. We calculate the

newly discovered HI cloud appears to be a typical disk galaxy since it has a

the velocity-position diagram. Moreover, this disk galaxy has an extremely low
absolute magnitude (M_B>-10.0 mag) and stellar mass (<6.9*10^5 Msun).
Furthermore, we obtained that the HI mass of this galaxy is 8.3*10^7 Msun, and
the dynamical mass to total baryonic mass ratio is 47+-27, implying that dark

observational evidence that FAST J0139+4328 is an isolated dark dwarf galaxy
with a redshift of z=0.0083. This is the first time that an isolated dark

important aspect of the amperometry method is the sub-millisecond temporal
resolution of the current recordings which leads to several hundreds of
gigabytes of high-quality data. In this study, we present a universal method
for the classification with respect to diverse amperometric datasets using
data-driven approaches in computational science. We demonstrate a very high
prediction accuracy (greater than or equal to 95%). This includes an end-to-end
systematic machine learning workflow for amperometric time series datasets
consisting of pre-processing; feature extraction; model identification;
training and testing; followed by feature importance evaluation - all
implemented. We tested the method on heterogeneous amperometric time series
datasets generated using different experimental approaches, chemical
stimulations, electrode types, and varying recording times. We identified a
certain overarching set of common features across these datasets which enables
accurate predictions. Further, we showed that information relevant for the
classification of amperometric traces are neither in the spiky segments alone,
nor can it be retrieved from just the temporal structure of spikes. In fact,
the transients between spikes and the trace baselines carry essential
information for a successful classification, thereby strongly demonstrating
that an effective feature representation of amperometric time series requires
the full time series. To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies that
propose a scheme for machine learning, and in particular, supervised learning
on full amperometry time series data.

systems thanks to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, along the journey
of deploying and iterating on EBR in production, we still identify some
fundamental issues in existing methods. First, when dealing with large corpus
of candidate items, EBR models often have difficulties in balancing the
performance on distinguishing highly relevant items (positives) from both
irrelevant ones (easy negatives) and from somewhat related yet not competitive
ones (hard negatives). Also, we have little control in the diversity and
fairness of the retrieval results because of the ``greedy'' nature of nearest
vector search. These issues compromise the performance of EBR methods in
large-scale industrial scenarios. This paper introduces a simple and
proven-in-production solution to overcome these issues. The proposed solution
takes a divide-and-conquer approach: the whole set of candidate items are
divided into multiple clusters and we run EBR to retrieve relevant candidates
from each cluster in parallel; top candidates from each cluster are then
combined by some controllable merging strategies. This approach allows our EBR
models to only concentrate on discriminating positives from mostly hard
negatives. It also enables further improvement from a multi-tasking learning
(MTL) perspective: retrieval problems within each cluster can be regarded as
individual tasks; inspired by recent successes in prompting and prefix-tuning,
we propose an efficient task adaption technique further boosting the retrieval
performance within each cluster with negligible overheads.

including thermal, power, bandwidth and communications constraints as well as
the impact of radiation on spacecraft. PASEOS can be run both as a

directly on edge hardware. We demonstrate these capabilities in three

tasks over several hours and one training a machine learning model in a

conceptually designed to allow deep space scenarios too. Our results show that
PASEOS can model the described scenarios efficiently and thus provide insight

curve in a low-dimensional Euclidean space. We prove that the probability
distribution of the points along this curve determines the underlying pulse
signal uniquely. Based on this discovery, we propose an algorithm for pulse
estimation from a finite number of short sequences of pulse-stream samples.

the ratio of charged moments of the partially transposed reduced density matrix
as an expectation value of twist operators. These are ``fused"" versions of the
more traditionally used branch point twist fields and were introduced in a

address some specific issues regarding fermionic excitations, whose treatment
requires the notion of partial time-reversal transformation, and we discuss the
differences and analogies with their bosonic counterpart. We find that although
the operation of partial transposition requires a redefinition for fermionic
theories, the ratio of the negativity moments between an excited state and the
ground state is universal and identical for fermions and bosons as well as for

helpful and useful for humans, and to align with human and social values. Prior
work have achieved remarkable successes by learning from human feedback to
understand and follow instructions. Nonetheless, these methods are either
founded on hand-picked model generations that are favored by human annotators,
rendering them ineffective in terms of data utilization and challenging to
apply in general, or they depend on reward functions and reinforcement
learning, which are prone to imperfect reward function and extremely
challenging to optimize. In this work, we propose a novel technique, Chain of
Hindsight, that is easy to optimize and can learn from any form of feedback,
regardless of its polarity. Our idea is inspired by how humans learn from
extensive feedback presented in the form of languages. We convert all types of
feedback into sentences, which are then used to fine-tune the model, allowing
us to take advantage of the language comprehension capabilities of language
models. We condition the model on a sequence of model generations paired with
feedback. By doing so, models are trained to generate outputs based on
feedback, and models can learn to identify and correct negative attributes or
errors. Applying our method to large language models, we observed that Chain of
Hindsight significantly surpasses previous methods in aligning language models
with human preferences. We observed significant improvements on summarization

due to dissimilar reaction rates. The ingress of hydrogen into metals is a
paradigmatic example of a technologically-relevant phenomenon whose simulation
is compromised by the stiffness of the reaction terms, as reaction rates vary
over orders of magnitude and this significantly limits the time increment size.
In this work, we present a lumped integration scheme for electro-chemical
interface reactions that does not suffer from numerical oscillations. The
scheme integrates the reactions in a consistent manner, while it also decouples
neighbouring nodes and allows for larger time increments to be used without
oscillations or convergence issues. The stability and potential of our scheme
is demonstrated by simulating hydrogen ingress over a wide range of reaction
rate constants and environmental conditions. While previous hydrogen uptake
predictions were limited to time scales of minutes, the present lumped
integration scheme enables conducting simulations over tens of years, allowing
us to reach steady state conditions and quantify hydrogen ingress for time
scales relevant to practical applications.

liquids by the instantaneous-normal-mode spectrum. While in glasses
instantaneous configurations correspond to minima of the potential-energy
hypersurface and all eigenvalues of the associated Hessian matrix are therefore
positive, in liquids this is no longer true, and modes corresponding to both
positive and negative eigenvalues exist. The instantaneous-normal-mode spectrum
has been numerically investigated in the past, and it has been demonstrated to
bring important information on the liquid dynamics. A systematic deeper
theoretical understanding is now needed. Heterogeneous-elasticity theory has
proven to be successful in explaining many details of the low-frequency
excitations in glasses, ranging from the thoroughly studied boson peak, down to
the more elusive non-phononic excitations observed in numerical simulations at
the lowest frequencies. Here we present an extension of
heterogeneous-elasticity theory to the liquid state, and show that the outcome
of the theory agrees well to the results of extensive molecular-dynamics
simulations of a model liquid at different temperatures. We show that the
spectral shape strongly depends on temperature, being symmetric at high
temperatures and becoming rather asymmetric at low temperatures, close to the
dynamical critical temperature. Most importantly, we demonstrate that the
theory naturally reproduces a surprising phenomenon, a zero-energy spectral
singularity with a cusp-like character developing in the vibrational spectra
upon cooling. This feature, known from a few previous numerical studies, has
been generally overlooked in the past due to a misleading representation of the

New or refined methods for determining instantaneous scalar and vector
pattern speeds from a restricted domain are developed, for applications in
N-body simulations or in galaxies.
  Methods. The general feature used throughout follows from the fact that the
time-derivative of a function of the coordinates is linearly proportional to
its rotation rate and its particle velocities. Knowing these allow in general
to retrieve the instantaneous pattern speed vector by linear optimization.
Similarly, if an invariant function depends both on the position and
velocities, then its instantaneous rotation vectors in space can be retrieved.
Knowing the accelerations allows to find rotation in velocity space.
  Results. The first 3 methods are based on the assumed rotational invariance
of functions at each point in space or velocity space:
  1) The 6D invariant function method measuring the pattern speed vectors in
space and velocity space,
  2) The differential/regional 3D Tremaine-Weinberg method evaluated over high
signal to noise ratio regions,
  3) The 3D Jacobi integral method yielding the potential pattern speed.
  Extensions to derive the rotation center position, speed and acceleration are
introduced in 1) and 3). The last 2 methods are based on the assumed invariance
of average functions of the particle coordinates.
  4) The moment of inertia methods by using the derivative of the singular
value decomposition,
  5) The 2D Fourier method (3D for m = 2 mode) giving the mode rotation speeds.
Pattern speed accelerations are also derived in 4) and 5).

choice of approaches.

time-correlated noise component within the pilot data to be between 16 and 23
times higher than the white noise level at the scale of k = 0.04 Mpc^-1. Having
determined that the MeerKAT 1/f noise is partially correlated across all the

to remove 1/f noise but find that over-cleaning results in the removal of HI
power at large (angular and radial) scales; a power loss of 20 per cent is seen
for a 2-mode SVD clean at the scale of k = 0.04 Mpc^-1. We compare the impact
of map-making using weighting by the full noise covariance (i.e. including a
1/f component), as opposed to just a simple unweighted binning, finding that
including the time-correlated noise information reduces the excess power added
by 1/f noise by up to 30 per cent.

all pairs of places that can be marked together in some reachable marking. Our

scan planning and MR guided interventions. However, the requirement for
real-time acquisition and near real-time visualization constrains the
achievable spatio-temporal resolution.
  PURPOSE: To improve interactive imaging resolution through optimization of
undersampled spiral sampling and leveraging of deep learning for low-latency
reconstruction (deep artifact suppression).
  POPULATION: Deep artefact suppression training data consisted of 692
breath-held CINEs. The developed interactive sequence was tested prospectively
in 12 patients (10 for image evaluation, 2 during catheterization).
  ASSESSMENT: In simulated data, NRMSE, pSNR and SSIM of radial, uniform spiral
and optimized spiral sampling were compared. In the prospective study, the
optimized spiral interactive sequence was compared to conventional Cartesian
real-time, and breath-hold cine imaging in terms quantitative and qualitative
image metrics.
  RESULTS: The NRMSE, pSNR and SSIM were all statistically significantly higher
in simulations of optimized spiral compared to radial and uniform spiral
sampling, particularly after scan plan changes (SSIM: 0.71 vs 0.45 and 0.43).
Prospectively, HyperSLICE proposed a higher spatial and temporal resolution
than conventional Cartesian real-time imaging. The pipeline was demonstrated in
patients during catheter pull back showing sufficiently fast reconstruction for
interactive imaging.
  DATA CONCLUSION: HyperSLICE enables higher spatial and temporal interactive
imaging. Optimizing the spiral sampling enabled better overall image quality
and better handling of image transitions compared to radial and uniform spiral
trajectories.

process of exocytosis in real-time. Given the high precision of recording that
amperometry procedures offer, the volume of data generated can span over
several hundreds of megabytes to a few gigabytes and therefore necessitates
systematic and reproducible methods for analysis. Though the spike
characteristics of amperometry traces in the time domain hold information about
the dynamics of exocytosis, these biochemical signals are, more often than not,
characterized by time-varying signal properties. Such signals with time-variant
properties may occur at different frequencies and therefore analyzing them in
the frequency domain may provide statistical validation for observations
already established in the time domain. This necessitates the use of
time-variant, frequency-selective signal processing methods as well, which can
adeptly quantify the dominant or mean frequencies in the signal. The Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) is a well-established computational tool that is
commonly used to find the frequency components of a signal buried in noise. In
this work, we outline a method for spike-based frequency analysis of
amperometry traces using FFT that also provides statistical validation of
observations on spike characteristics in the time domain. We demonstrate the
method by utilizing simulated signals and by subsequently testing it on diverse
amperometry datasets generated from different experiments with various chemical
stimulations. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated open-source
tool available dedicated to the analysis of spikes extracted from amperometry

the burst shapes, including their larger amplitudes and later peaks towards
longer wavelengths. We are thus able to infer the start and end times of mass
loading into the circumstellar disks of these stars. The disk sizes are
typically 3-6 times the areas of the central star. The disk temperatures are
~40%, and the disk luminosities are ~10% of those of the central Be star,

astrophysical processes such as the gamma-process of heavy element

potential is a key parameter to estimate the rates of these reactions. The AOMP
can be tested by measuring the cross section of alpha-scattering as well as
alpha-induced reactions. Low energy elastic alpha-scattering on 144Sm has
recently been measured with high precision. The aim of the present work was to
complement that work by measuring the (a,n) cross sections on 144Sm at low
energies. The experimental data shall be used to constrain the AOMP. From this
potential the 144Sm(a,g)148Gd reaction rate can be derived with reduced
uncertainties. The 144Sm(a,n)147Gd reaction was studied by bombarding Sm
targets with alpha-beams provided by the cyclotron accelerator of Atomki. The
cross section was determined using the activation method. The gamma-radiation
following the decay of the 147Gd reaction product was measured with a HPGe
detector. The experimental data are analyzed within the statistical model. The
cross section was measured in the alpha-energy range between 13 and 20 MeV in 1
MeV steps, i.e., from close above the (a,n) threshold. The results were
compared with statistical model calculations using various approaches and
parametrizations for the AOMP, and excellent agreement was obtained for two
recent potentials. However, these potentials cannot reproduce literature data
for the 144Sm(a,g)148Gd reaction with the same accuracy. Constraints for the
AOMP were derived from an analysis of the new 144Sm(a,n)147Gd data and
literature data for 144Sm(a,g)148Gd. These constraints enable a determination
of the reaction rate of the 144Sm(a,g)148Gd reaction with significantly reduced

formula fails when the oscillation range is small compared to the resonance
region. This failure is more severe in the adiabatic limit, when the plasma
frequency varies slowly, resulting in a conversion probability that is not

interpolation of these functions are therefore of great importance. In this
paper, we design a moving least-squares approach for scattered data
approximation that incorporates the discontinuities in the weight functions.
The idea is to control the influence of the data sites on the approximant, not
only with regards to their distance from the evaluation point, but also with
respect to the discontinuity of the underlying function. We also provide an
error estimate on a suitable {\it piecewise} Sobolev Space. The numerical
experiments are in compliance with the convergence rate derived theoretically.

complex transverse AC conductance, $\sigma_{xx}^{AC} (\omega)$, was found from
simultaneous measurements of attenuation and velocity of surface acoustic waves

differences between the results for filling factor 1 and filling factor 1/3.
Both to the left and to the right of these values maxima of a specific shape,

of the results of our acoustic measurements at different temperatures and

formation of collective localized states, namely the domains of a pinned Wigner

around the star. The disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar
System, was reported to extend from 74 to 84 AU from the central star. The high
photometric precision of the Characterising Exoplanet Satellite (CHEOPS)
provided an exceptional opportunity to observe small variations in the light
curve due to transiting material in the disk. This is a unique chance to
investigate processes in the debris disk. Photometric observations of DE Boo of
a total of four days were carried out with CHEOPS. Photometric variations due
to spots on the stellar surface were subtracted from the light curves by
applying a two-spot model and a fourth-order polynomial. The photometric
observations were accompanied by spectroscopic measurements with the 1m RCC
telescope at Piszk\'estet\H{o} and with the SOPHIE spectrograph in order to
refine the astrophysical parameters of DE Boo. We present a detailed analysis
of the photometric observation of DE Boo. We report the presence of nonperiodic
transient features in the residual light curves with a transit duration of
0.3-0.8 days. We calculated the maximum distance of the material responsible
for these variations to be 2.47 AU from the central star, much closer than most
of the mass of the debris disk. Furthermore, we report the first observation of
flaring events in this system. We interpreted the transient features as the
result of scattering in an inner debris disk around DE Boo. The processes
responsible for these variations were investigated in the context of
interactions between planetesimals in the system.

and development of open RAN (O-RAN). So far, however, the applicability of
O-RAN in controlling and optimizing RAN functions has not been widely
investigated. In this paper, we jointly optimize the flow-split distribution,
congestion control and scheduling (JFCS) to enable an intelligent traffic
steering application in O-RAN. Combining tools from network utility
maximization and stochastic optimization, we introduce a multi-layer
optimization framework that provides fast convergence, long-term
utility-optimality and significant delay reduction compared to the
state-of-the-art and baseline RAN approaches. Our main contributions are
three-fold: i) we propose the novel JFCS framework to efficiently and
adaptively direct traffic to appropriate radio units; ii) we develop
low-complexity algorithms based on the reinforcement learning, inner
approximation and bisection search methods to effectively solve the JFCS
problem in different time scales; and iii) the rigorous theoretical performance
results are analyzed to show that there exists a scaling factor to improve the
tradeoff between delay and utility-optimization. Collectively, the insights in
this work will open the door towards fully automated networks with enhanced
control and flexibility. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in terms of the convergence rate,
long-term utility-optimality and delay reduction.

is employed as a zero-resistivity electrode material for a surface acoustic
wave resonator with internal quality factors $Q \approx 17000$ representing a
three-fold enhancement compared to identical devices with normal conducting
electrodes. Superconducting operation of $\approx 400\,\mathrm{MHz}$ resonators
is achieved to temperatures $T>7\,\mathrm{K}$ and electrical radio frequency

resonator operated in the superconducting regime. Position and frequency
selective coupling mediated by deformation potential coupling is validated
using time-integrated and time-resolved optical spectroscopy. Furthermore,
acoustoelectric charge state control is achieved in a modified device geometry
harnessing large piezoelectric fields inside the resonator. The hybrid quantum
dot - surface acoustic wave resonator can be scaled to higher operation
frequencies and smaller mode volumes for quantum phase modulation and
transduction between photons and phonons via the quantum dot. Finally, the
employed materials allow for the realization of other types of optoelectronic
devices, including superconducting single photon detectors and integrated
photonic and phononic circuits.

deep learning models by imposing a prior distribution over model parameters and
inferring a posterior distribution based on observed data. The model sampled
from the posterior distribution can be used for providing ensemble predictions
and quantifying prediction uncertainty. It is well-known that deep learning
models with lower sharpness have better generalization ability. However,
existing posterior inferences are not aware of sharpness/flatness in terms of
formulation, possibly leading to high sharpness for the models sampled from

variational inference approach for the sharpness-aware posterior. Specifically,
the models sampled from our sharpness-aware posterior, and the optimal

built on the SAV technique and the general linear time discretizations (GLTD)
as well as the extrapolation for the nonlinear term. Different from [44], the
GLTDs with three parameters discussed here are not necessarily algebraically
stable. Some algebraic identities are derived by using the method of
undetermined coefficients and further used to establish the modified-energy
inequalities for the unconditional modified-energy stability of the
semi-discrete-in-time SAV-GL schemes. It is worth emphasizing that those
algebraic identities or energy inequalities are not necessarily unique for some
choices of three parameters in the GLTDs. Numerical experiments on the
Allen-Cahn, the Cahn-Hilliard and the phase field crystal models with the
periodic boundary conditions are conducted to validate the unconditional
modified-energy stability of the SAV-GL schemes, where the Fourier
pseudo-spectral method is employed in space with the zero-padding to eliminate
the aliasing error and the time stepsizes for ensuring the original-energy
decay are estimated by using the stability regions of our SAV-GL schemes for
the test equation. The resulting time stepsize constraints for the SAV-GL
schemes are almost consistent with the numerical results on the above gradient

spectral entropy production can be obtained from experimentally observable
quantities, which we illustrate using time-resolved X-ray scattering data for
SrTiO$_3$. Further, we compute the spectral entropy production as a function of

upcoming neutrino experiments will also be sensitive to physics beyond the
Standard Model. KM3NeT/ORCA is a neutrino detector optimised for measuring
atmospheric neutrinos from a few GeV to around 100 GeV. In this paper, the
sensitivity of the KM3NeT/ORCA detector to neutrino decay has been explored. A
three-flavour neutrino oscillation scenario, where the third neutrino mass
state $\nu_3$ decays into an invisible state, e.g. a sterile neutrino, is
considered. We find that KM3NeT/ORCA would be sensitive to invisible neutrino
decays with $1/\alpha_3=\tau_3/m_3 < 180$~$\mathrm{ps/eV}$ at $90\%$ confidence
level, assuming true normal ordering. Finally, the impact of neutrino decay on
the precision of KM3NeT/ORCA measurements for $\theta_{23}$, $\Delta m^2_{31}$
and mass ordering have been studied. No significant effect of neutrino decay on
the sensitivity to these measurements has been found.

real-time in high-frequency data streams, sometimes with limited available
computational resources. This is an important task that is rooted in many
real-world applications, including and not limited to cybersecurity, medicine
and astrophysics. While fast and efficient online algorithms have been recently
introduced, these rely on parametric assumptions which are often violated in
practical applications. Motivated by data streams from the telecommunications
sector, we build a flexible nonparametric approach to detect a change in the
distribution of a sequence. Our procedure, NP-FOCuS, builds a sequential
likelihood ratio test for a change in a set of points of the empirical
cumulative density function of our data. This is achieved by keeping track of
the number of observations above or below those points. Thanks to functional
pruning ideas, NP-FOCuS has a computational cost that is log-linear in the
number of observations and is suitable for high-frequency data streams. In
terms of detection power, NP-FOCuS is seen to outperform current nonparametric
online changepoint techniques in a variety of settings. We demonstrate the
utility of the procedure on both simulated and real data.

Diverse agents can compete to produce the best performing model for a task by
reusing the modules introduced to the system by competing agents. The presented

of the ionised interstellar medium (IISM) and causes corruptions in pulsar
timing experiments. Two types of ISS phenomena (intensity scintillation and
pulse broadening) are caused by electron density fluctuations on small scales
(< 0.01 AU). Theory predicts that these are related, and both have been widely
employed to study the properties of the IISM. Larger scales ($\sim$1-100\,AU)
cause measurable changes in dispersion and these can be correlated with ISS
observations to estimate the fluctuation spectrum over a very wide scale range.
IISM measurements can often be modeled by a homogeneous power-law spatial
spectrum of electron density with the Kolmogorov ($-11/3$) spectral exponent.
Here we aim to test the validity of using the Kolmogorov exponent with
PSR~J0826+2637. We do so using observations of intensity scintillation, pulse
broadening and dispersion variations across a wide fractional bandwidth (20 --
180\,MHz). We present that the frequency dependence of the intensity
scintillation in the high frequency band matches the expectations of a
Kolmogorov spectral exponent but the pulse broadening in the low frequency band
does not change as rapidly as predicted with this assumption. We show that this
behavior is due to an inhomogeneity in the scattering region, specifically that
the scattering is dominated by a region of transverse size $\sim$40\,AU. The
power spectrum of the electron density, however, maintains the Kolmogorov
spectral exponent from spatial scales of 5$\times10^{-6}$\,AU to $\sim$100\,AU.

HMYSO G24.33$+$0.14. VLBA was used to image the 6.7 and 12.2 GHz methanol and
22.2 GHz water vapor masers at three epochs guided by monitoring the methanol
line with the Torun 32m telescope. The 6.7 GHz maser maps were also obtained
with the EVN and LBA during the flare. WISE data were used to find correlations
between the 6.7 GHz maser and IR fluxes. The 6.7 GHz methanol maser cloudlets
are distributed over $\sim$3500 au, and the morphology of most of them is
stable although their brightness varies following the course of the total flux
density on a timescale of two months. The 12.2 GHz methanol maser cloudlets
cover an area an order of magnitude smaller than that of 6.7 GHz emission, and
both transitions emerge from the same masing gas. The 22.2 GHz maser cloudlets
lie in the central region and show a systematic increase in brightness and
moderate changes in size and orientation, together with the velocity drift of
the strongest cloudlet during two months of the VLBI observing period. Time lag
estimates imply the propagation of changes in the physical conditions of the
masing region with a subluminal speed ($\sim$0.3c). A tight correlation of IR
(4.6$\mu$m) and 6.7 GHz flux densities is found, supporting the radiative
pumping model. Comparison with the 230 GHz ALMA data indicates that the
methanol masers are distributed in the inner part of the rotating disk, whereas
the 22.2 GHz emission traces the compact inner component of the bipolar outflow
or a jet structure.

and morphological evolution of the redshifted 21-cm signal coming from the

the impact of the array synthesized beam on the LCS analysis of the 21-cm
signal considering the upcoming low-frequency Square Kilometer Array (SKA1-Low)
observations using a realistic simulation for such observation based on the
21cmE2E-pipeline using OSKAR. We find that bias in LCS estimation is introduced
in synthetic observations due to the array beam. This in turn shifts the
apparent percolation transition point towards the later stages of reionization.
The biased estimates of LCS, occurring due to the effect of the lower
resolution (lack of longer baselines) and the telescope synthesized beam will
lead to a biased interpretation of the reionization history. This is important
to note while interpreting any future 21-cm signal images from upcoming or
future telescopes like the SKA, HERA, etc. We conclude that one may need denser
$uv$-coverage at longer baselines for a better deconvolution of the array
synthesized beam from the 21-cm images and a relatively unbiased estimate of
LCS from such images.

pool. It is focused on the effects of high-energy splash regimes, caused by the
impact of large raindrops at high velocities. Such cases are characterized by
short time scales and complex mechanisms, and they have thus received little
attention until now. The BASILISK open-source solver is used to perform
three-dimensional Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS). The capabilities of the
octree adaptive mesh refinement techniques enable to capture the small-scale
features of the flow, while the Volume of Fluid (VOF) approach combined with a
balanced force surface tension calculation is applied to advect the volume
fraction of the liquids and reconstruct the interfaces. The numerical results
compare well with experimental visualizations: both the evolution of crown and
cavity, the emanation of ligaments, the formation of bubble canopy, and the
growth of the downward spiral jet that pierces through the cavity bottom, are
correctly reproduced. Reliable quantitative agreements are also obtained
regarding the time evolution of rim positions, cavity dimensions and droplet
distributions through an observation window. Furthermore, simulation gives
access to various aspects of the internal flows (velocity, vorticity, pressure,
energy budget), which allows to better explain the corresponding physical
phenomena. Details of the early dynamics of bubble ring entrapment and
splashing performance, the formation/collapse of bubble canopy, and the
spreading of drop liquid, are discussed. The statistics of droplet size show
the bimodal distribution in time, corroborating distinct primary mechanisms of
droplet production at different stages.

speedup factor of up to approximately 1200. The significant speedup
facilitates, e.g., dynamic model fitting to the EHT data, including
polarimetric data. The method extension may enable studies of emission from
plasma with nonthermal particle distribution functions for which accurate

reduces the carbon footprint of the generation of the EHT image libraries by at

weak spin-0 eigenstates is tiny and the dark matter (DM) sector is either
decoupled or kinematically inaccessible. Utilising two suitable benchmark
scenarios, we determine the constraints on the parameter space of the 2HDM+$a$

in Higgs decays. We find that depending on the precise mass spectrum of the
spin-0 states, mixing angles $\theta$ in the ballpark of a few $10^{-8}$ to
$10^{-5}$ can be excluded based on LHC Run II data. This finding emphasises the
unique role that searches for displaced signatures can play in constraining the
parameter space of the 2HDM+$a$ model. The ensuing DM phenomenology is also
discussed. In particular, we show that parameter choices leading to an

  Kriging","WWW 2023 paper",,"10.1145/3543507.3583525",,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatio-temporal kriging is an important problem in web and social
applications, such as Web or Internet of Things, where things (e.g., sensors)
connected into a web often come with spatial and temporal properties. It aims
to infer knowledge for (the things at) unobserved locations using the data from
(the things at) observed locations during a given time period of interest. This
problem essentially requires \emph{inductive learning}. Once trained, the model
should be able to perform kriging for different locations including newly given
ones, without retraining. However, it is challenging to perform accurate
kriging results because of the heterogeneous spatial relations and diverse
temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel inductive graph
representation learning model for spatio-temporal kriging. We first encode
heterogeneous spatial relations between the unobserved and observed locations
by their spatial proximity, functional similarity, and transition probability.
Based on each relation, we accurately aggregate the information of most
correlated observed locations to produce inductive representations for the
unobserved locations, by jointly modeling their similarities and differences.
Then, we design relation-aware gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks to
adaptively capture the temporal correlations in the generated sequence
representations for each relation. Finally, we propose a multi-relation
attention mechanism to dynamically fuse the complex spatio-temporal information
at different time steps from multiple relations to compute the kriging output.
Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art methods consistently, and the advantage is more
significant when there are fewer observed locations. Our code is available at

amount of personal data online. One-time authentication techniques such as
passwords and physiological biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, face, and iris) have
their own advantages but also disadvantages since they can be stolen or
emulated, and do not prevent access to the underlying device, once it is
unlocked. To address these challenges, complementary authentication systems
based on behavioural biometrics have emerged. The goal is to continuously
profile users based on their interaction with the mobile device. However,
existing behavioural authentication schemes are not (i) user-agnostic meaning
that they cannot dynamically handle changes in the user-base without model
re-training, or (ii) do not scale well to authenticate millions of users.
  In this paper, we present AuthentiSense, a user-agnostic, scalable, and
efficient behavioural biometrics authentication system that enables continuous
authentication and utilizes only motion patterns (i.e., accelerometer,
gyroscope and magnetometer data) while users interact with mobile apps. Our
approach requires neither manually engineered features nor a significant amount
of data for model training. We leverage a few-shot learning technique, called
Siamese network, to authenticate users at a large scale. We perform a
systematic measurement study and report the impact of the parameters such as
interaction time needed for authentication and n-shot verification (comparison
with enrollment samples) at the recognition stage. Remarkably, AuthentiSense
achieves high accuracy of up to 97% in terms of F1-score even when evaluated in
a few-shot fashion that requires only a few behaviour samples per user (3
shots). Our approach accurately authenticates users only after 1 second of user
interaction. For AuthentiSense, we report a FAR and FRR of 0.023 and 0.057,

to evaluate the ability of a speaker embedding to disentangle the speaker
identity from the other speech characteristics. This means that the embeddings
are far from ideal, highly dependent on the training corpus and still include a
degree of residual information pertaining to factors such as linguistic
content, recording conditions or speaking style of the utterance. This paper
introduces an analysis over six sets of speaker embeddings extracted with some
of the most recent and high-performing DNN architectures, and in particular,
the degree to which they are able to truly disentangle the speaker identity
from the speech signal. To correctly evaluate the architectures, a large
multi-speaker parallel speech dataset is used. The dataset includes 46 speakers
uttering the same set of prompts, recorded in either a professional studio or

simple classification and regression methods are able to extract several

time-constraints. Deep learning-based methods have shown great potential for
glacier calving front delineation from optical and radar satellite imagery. The
calving front is represented as a single thin line between the ocean and the
glacier, which makes the task vulnerable to inaccurate predictions. The limited
availability of annotated glacier imagery leads to a lack of data diversity
(not all possible combinations of different weather conditions, terminus
shapes, sensors, etc. are present in the data), which exacerbates the
difficulty of accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose
Attention-Multi-hooking-Deep-supervision HookNet (AMD-HookNet), a novel glacier
calving front segmentation framework for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.
The proposed method aims to enhance the feature representation capability
through multiple information interactions between low-resolution and
high-resolution inputs based on a two-branch U-Net. The attention mechanism,
integrated into the two branch U-Net, aims to interact between the
corresponding coarse and fine-grained feature maps. This allows the network to
automatically adjust feature relationships, resulting in accurate
pixel-classification predictions. Extensive experiments and comparisons on the
challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe show that our
AMD-HookNet achieves a mean distance error of 438 m to the ground truth
outperforming the current state of the art by 42%, which validates its
effectiveness.

spin rotation and relaxation ($\mathrm{\mu}$SR) study of Rb$_2$Mo$_3$As$_3$

formation of vortex lattice. Comparison of vortex lattice broadening against
single gap $s-$, $p-$ and $d-$wave models shows the best agreement for the
$s-$wave scenario but with the anomalously small superconducting gap,
$\Delta_0$, to $T_{\rm c}$ ratio of $2\Delta_0/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=2.74(1)$. The
alternative nodal $p-$wave or $d-$wave scenarios with marginally worse goodness
of fit would yield more realistic $2\Delta_0/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}=3.50(2)$ and

crucial task in statistical learning. Recently, several studies have attempted
to analyze the generalization error in such settings by using tools from
fractal geometry. While these works have successfully introduced new
mathematical tools to apprehend generalization, they heavily rely on a
Lipschitz continuity assumption, which in general does not hold for neural
networks and might make the bounds vacuous. In this work, we address this issue
and prove fractal geometry-based generalization bounds without requiring any
Lipschitz assumption. To achieve this goal, we build up on a classical covering
argument in learning theory and introduce a data-dependent fractal dimension.
Despite introducing a significant amount of technical complications, this new
notion lets us control the generalization error (over either fixed or random
hypothesis spaces) along with certain mutual information (MI) terms. To provide
a clearer interpretation to the newly introduced MI terms, as a next step, we
introduce a notion of ""geometric stability"" and link our bounds to the prior
art. Finally, we make a rigorous connection between the proposed data-dependent
dimension and topological data analysis tools, which then enables us to compute
the dimension in a numerically efficient way. We support our theory with
experiments conducted on various settings.

emerge from our analysis. First, the composition of firms' export baskets
changes relatively little from one year to the other, and products far from the
firm's core competencies, with low coreness, are more likely to be dropped.
Second, higher coreness is associated with larger export flows at the firm
level. Third, such firm-level patterns also have implications at the aggregate
level: products that are, on average, exported with higher coreness have higher
export flows at the country level, which holds across all levels of product
complexity. Therefore, the paper shows that how closely a product fits within a
firm's capabilities is important for economic performance at both the firm and

robust evidence both across our three countries and for each country

consensus on what class of probability distributions should be adopted to
describe financial returns and different models used in the literature have
demonstrated, to varying extent, an ability to reproduce empirically observed
stylized facts. In order to provide some clarity, in this paper we perform a
thorough study of the most popular models of return distributions as obtained
in the empirical analyses of high-frequency financial data. We compare the
statistical properties and simulate the dynamics of non-Gaussian financial
fluctuations by means of Monte Carlo sampling from the different models in
terms of realistic tail exponents. Our findings show a noticeable consistency
between the considered return distributions in the modeling of the scaling
properties of large price changes. We also discuss the convergence rate to the
asymptotic distributions of the non-Gaussian stochastic processes and we study,
as a first example of possible applications, the impact of our results on
option pricing in comparison with the standard Black and Scholes approach.

systems modelled by ordinary differential equations using Lyapunov densities.
Firstly, the weak reach-avoid verification is considered. Given an initial set,
a safe set and a target set, the weak reach-avoid verification is to verify
whether the reach-avoid property (i.e., the system will enter the target set
eventually while staying inside the safe set before the first target hitting
time) holds for almost all states in the initial set. We propose two novel
sufficient conditions using Lyapunov densities for the weak reach-avoid
verification. These two sufficient conditions are shown to be weaker than
existing ones, providing more possibilities of verifying weak reach-avoid
properties successfully. Then, we generalize these conditions to the
verification of reach-avoid properties for all states in the initial set.
Finally, an example demonstrates theoretical developments of proposed

of the design parameters to the PDE's state. The adjoint method avoids this
Jacobian by computing partial derivatives of a Lagrangian. Evaluating these
derivatives requires the solution of a second PDE with the adjoint differential
operator to the constraint, resulting in a backwards-in-time simulation.
  Particle-based Monte Carlo solvers are often used to compute the solution to
high-dimensional PDEs. However, such solvers have the drawback of introducing
noise to the computed results, thus requiring stochastic optimization methods.
To guarantee convergence in this setting, both the constraint and adjoint Monte
Carlo simulations should simulate the same particle trajectories. For large
simulations, storing full paths from the constraint equation for re-use in the
adjoint equation becomes infeasible due to memory limitations. In this paper,
we provide a reversible extension to the family of permuted congruential
pseudorandom number generators (PCG). We then use such a generator to recompute

deteriorates for higher-order responses due to the presence of high-frequency
oscillations in the induced multipole moment in the time domain. This problem
has been ascribed to missing higher-order corrections. We here demonstrate that
the deviations are caused by nonadiabatic effects arising from the finite-time

this article, we provide a mirror map at the level of state spaces between the
LG A-model state space and the LG B-model state space for the mirror model
predicted by the BHK mirror symmetry extension for nonabelian LG models. We
introduce two technical conditions, the Diagonal Scaling Condition, and the
Equivariant $\Phi$ condition, under which a bi-degree preserving isomorphism of
state spaces (the mirror map) is guaranteed to exist, and we prove that the
condition is always satisfied if the permutation part of the group is cyclic of
prime order.

capture the entirety of one's mathematical beliefs, while pointing at a
hierarchy of systems of increasing logical strength that make progressively
more explicit those \emph{implicit} assumptions. This notion of \emph{implicit
commitment} motivates directly or indirectly several research programmes in
logic and the foundations of mathematics; yet there hasn't been a direct
logical analysis of the notion of implicit commitment itself. In a recent
paper, \L elyk and Nicolai carried out an initial assessment of this project by
studying necessary conditions for implicit commitments; from seemingly weak
assumptions on implicit commitments of an arithmetical system $S$, it can be
derived that a uniform reflection principle for $S$ -- stating that all
numerical instances of theorems of $S$ are true -- must be contained in $S$'s
implicit commitments. This study gave rise to unexplored research avenues and
open questions. This paper addresses the main ones. We generalize this basic
framework for implicit commitments along two dimensions: in terms of iterations
of the basic implicit commitment operator, and via a study of implicit
commitments of theories in arbitrary first-order languages, not only couched in
an arithmetical language.

structure of networks - most often as a partition based on patterns variously
called communities, blocks, or clusters. Clearly, distinct methods designed to
detect different types of patterns may provide a variety of answers to the
network's mesoscale structure. Yet, even multiple runs of a given method can
sometimes yield diverse and conflicting results, yielding entire landscapes of
partitions which potentially include multiple (locally optimal) mesoscale
explanations of the network. Such ambiguity motivates a closer look at the
ability of these methods to find multiple qualitatively different 'ground
truth' partitions in a network. Here, we propose a generative model which
allows for two distinct partitions to be built into the mesoscale structure of
a single benchmark network. We demonstrate a use case of the benchmark model by
exploring the power of stochastic block models (SBMs) to detect coexisting
bi-community and core-periphery structures of different strengths. We find that
the ability to detect the two partitions individually varies considerably by
SBM variant and that coexistence of both partitions is recovered only in a very
limited number of cases. Our findings suggest that in most instances only one -
in some way dominating - structure can be detected, even in the presence of
other partitions in the generated network. They underline the need for
considering entire landscapes of partitions when different competing
explanations exist and motivate future research to advance partition
coexistence detection methods. Our model also contributes to the field of
benchmark networks more generally by enabling further exploration of the
ability of new and existing methods to detect ambiguity in mesoscale structure

baseline for such data-strict regimes. Furthermore, we provide formal sample
complexity guarantees for the algorithm in finite Markov Decision Problems. In
doing so, we formally demonstrate an unproven claim from Kearns & Singh (1998).
On the empirical side, our contribution is twofold. First, we develop a
practical, robust and principled evaluation protocol for offline RL methods,
making use of only the dataset provided for model selection. This stands in
contrast to the vast majority of previous works in offline RL, which tune
hyperparameters on the evaluation environment, limiting the practical
applicability when deployed in new, cost-critical environments. As such, we
establish precedent for the development and fair evaluation of offline RL

  Deep Reinforcement Learning via Multi-Timescale Learning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Decentralized cooperative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) can
be a versatile learning framework, particularly in scenarios where centralized
training is either not possible or not practical. One of the key challenges in
decentralized deep MARL is the non-stationarity of the learning environment
when multiple agents are learning concurrently. A commonly used and efficient
scheme for decentralized MARL is independent learning in which agents
concurrently update their policies independent of each other. We first show
that independent learning does not always converge, while sequential learning
where agents update their policies one after another in a sequence is
guaranteed to converge to an agent-by-agent optimal solution. In sequential
learning, when one agent updates its policy, all other agent's policies are
kept fixed, alleviating the challenge of non-stationarity due to concurrent
updates in other agents' policies. However, it can be slow because only one
agent is learning at any time. Therefore it might also not always be practical.
In this work, we propose a decentralized cooperative MARL algorithm based on
multi-timescale learning. In multi-timescale learning, all agents learn
concurrently, but at different learning rates. In our proposed method, when one
agent updates its policy, other agents are allowed to update their policies as
well, but at a slower rate. This speeds up sequential learning, while also
minimizing non-stationarity caused by other agents updating concurrently.
Multi-timescale learning outperforms state-of-the-art decentralized learning
methods on a set of challenging multi-agent cooperative tasks in the epymarl
(papoudakis2020) benchmark. This can be seen as a first step towards more
general decentralized cooperative deep MARL methods based on multi-timescale
learning.

Hermitian impurities or perturbations except for a few impurity-induced bound
states. Thus, it is important to ask whether \textit{local} non-Hermiticity can
cause drastic changes to the original Hermitian systems. Here we address this
issue affirmatively and present exact solutions for the double chain model with
local non-Hermitian terms possessing parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry.
Induced by the non-Hermiticity, the system undergoes a sequence of
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breakings, after which the eigenenergies appear in
complex conjugate pairs. The associated extended bulk states then become
scale-free localized and unidirectionally accumulated around the impurity.
There exist mobility edges separating the residual extended states until a full
scale-free localization of all eigenstates. Further increasing the
non-Hermitity counter-intuitively brings the system to a
$\mathcal{PT}$-restoration regime with fully real spectra except for a pair of
complex bound states. We demonstrate that the local non-Hermiticity generated
scale-free localization is a general phenomenon and can even survive the
quasiperiodic disorder. Our results indicate that the bulk properties of the
original Hermitian system can be globally reshaped by local non-Hermiticity.

critical societal topic of migration in Europe -- at least towards refugees
from Ukraine. We investigate whether this impression is substantiated by how
the topic is reflected in online news and social media, thus linking the
representation of the issue on the Web to its perception in society. For this
purpose, we combine and adapt leading-edge automatic text processing for a
novel multilingual stance detection approach. Starting from 5.5M Twitter posts
published by 565 European news outlets in one year, beginning September 2021,
plus replies, we perform a multilingual analysis of migration-related media
coverage and associated social media interaction for Europe and selected
European countries.
  The results of our analysis show that there is actually a reframing of the
discussion illustrated by the terminology change, e.g., from ""migrant"" to
""refugee"", often even accentuated with phrases such as ""real refugees"".
However, concerning a stance shift in public perception, the picture is more
diverse than expected. All analyzed cases show a noticeable temporal stance
shift around the start of the war in Ukraine. Still, there are apparent
national differences in the size and stability of this shift.

extraction, target information integration, and bounding box estimation. To
simplify this pipeline and unify the process of feature extraction and target
information integration, in this paper, we present a compact tracking
framework, termed as MixFormer, built upon transformers. Our core design is to
utilize the flexibility of attention operations, and propose a Mixed Attention
Module (MAM) for simultaneous feature extraction and target information
integration. This synchronous modeling scheme allows to extract target-specific
discriminative features and perform extensive communication between target and
search area. Based on MAM, we build our MixFormer trackers simply by stacking
multiple MAMs and placing a localization head on top. Specifically, we
instantiate two types of MixFormer trackers, a hierarchical tracker MixCvT, and
a non-hierarchical tracker MixViT. For these two trackers, we investigate a
series of pre-training methods and uncover the different behaviors between
supervised pre-training and self-supervised pre-training in our MixFormer
trackers. We also extend the masked pre-training to our MixFormer trackers and
design the competitive TrackMAE pre-training technique. Finally, to handle
multiple target templates during online tracking, we devise an asymmetric
attention scheme in MAM to reduce computational cost, and propose an effective
score prediction module to select high-quality templates. Our MixFormer
trackers set a new state-of-the-art performance on seven tracking benchmarks,

  Hardware",,,,,"cs.AR cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scaling neural network models has delivered dramatic quality gains across ML
problems. However, this scaling has increased the reliance on efficient
distributed training techniques. Accordingly, as with other distributed
computing scenarios, it is important to understand how will compute and
communication scale relative to one another as models scale and hardware
evolves? A careful study which answers this question can better guide the
design of future systems which can efficiently train future large models.
  Accordingly, this work provides a comprehensive multi-axial (algorithmic,
empirical, hardware evolution) analysis of compute vs. communication
(Comp-vs.-Comm) scaling for future Transformer models on future hardware.
First, our algorithmic analysis shows that compute generally enjoys an edge
over communication as models scale. However, since memory capacity scales
slower than compute, these trends are being stressed. Next, we quantify this
edge by empirically studying how Comp-vs.-Comm scales for future models on
future hardware. To avoid profiling numerous Transformer models across many
setups, we extract execution regions and project costs using operator models.
This allows a spectrum (hundreds) of future model/hardware scenarios to be
accurately studied ($<$15% error), and reduces profiling costs by 2100$\times$.
Our experiments show that communication will be a significant portion (40-75%)
of runtime as models and hardware evolve. Moreover, communication which is
hidden by overlapped computation in today's models often cannot be hidden in
future, larger models. Overall, this work highlights the increasingly large
role communication will play as models scale and discusses techniques and
upcoming technologies that can help address it.

the search of new physics beyond the Standard Model. The NUCLEUS experiment
aims to use the intense antineutrino flux produced from nuclear reactor cores
to perform measurements of the CEvNS cross-section via gram-scale ultra-low
threshold cryogenic detectors. A common problem with low threshold detectors is
the calibration, since most radioactive sources tend to saturate the dynamical
range of the sensors. In this dissertation, a photon-statistic based optical
calibration setup has been developed and tested using detectors from the
BULLKID R&D project. Both the developed hardware setup and the relative control
software allow to automatically perform a full calibration of an array of
detectors. During the development of this work, the DIANA analysis framework,
developed for the CUORE experiment, has been compatibilized with the NUCLEUS
DAQ and a new automatic analysis protocol was developed using the data from the
NUCLEUS prototype runs. This protocol proved to be accurate at reproducing the
results obtained via a model dependent study performed with an almost event by
event inspection that was carried out in the early stages of NUCLEUS.
Particular focus was given to the development of an event reconstruction
procedure used to measure the energy of events that lie outside the linear
response region of the detector. The last activity done for the NUCLEUS
experiment was to develop a python based toolkit for the study of the discovery
potential of the experiment. This toolkit was originally developed in the early
stages of NUCLEUS by J.Rothe and has been intensely upgraded during the work
presented in this thesis, in order to deal with different types of statistical
checks and procedures.

leads to a better performance compared to uni-modal approaches. However, in
real-world scenarios both modalities are not always available at the time of
inference, leading to performance degradation by models trained for multi-modal
inference. In this work, we propose a novel approach for deep audio
representation learning using audio-visual data when the video modality is
absent at inference. For this purpose, we adopt teacher-student knowledge
distillation under the framework of learning using privileged information
(LUPI). While the previous methods proposed for LUPI use soft-labels generated
by the teacher, in our proposed method we use embeddings learned by the teacher
to train the student network. We integrate our method in two different
settings: sequential data where the features are divided into multiple segments
throughout time, and non-sequential data where the entire features are treated
as one whole segment. In the non-sequential setting both the teacher and
student networks are comprised of an encoder component and a task header. We
use the embeddings produced by the encoder component of the teacher to train
the encoder of the student, while the task header of the student is trained
using ground-truth labels. In the sequential setting, the networks have an
additional aggregation component that is placed between the encoder and task
header. We use two sets of embeddings produced by the encoder and aggregation
component of the teacher to train the student. Similar to the non-sequential
setting, the task header of the student network is trained using ground-truth
labels. We test our framework on two different audio-visual tasks, namely
speaker recognition and speech emotion recognition and show considerable
improvements over sole audio-based recognition as well as prior works that use
LUPI.

two-photon absorption (TPA) by combining a precise two-photon resonance with a
very short coincidence time. Because of this short coincidence time, broadband
TPA is not sensitive to the spectrum of intermediate levels, making it the
optimal choice when the intermediate transitions are entirely virtual. In the
case of distinct intermediate resonances, it is possible to enhance TPA by
introducing a phase dispersion that matches the intermediate resonances. Here,
we consider the effects of a phase flip in the single photon spectrum, where
the phases of all frequencies above a certain frequency are shifted by half a
wavelength relative to the frequencies below this frequency. The frequency at
which the phase is flipped can then be scanned to reveal the position of
intermediate resonances. We find that a resonant phase flip maximizes the
contributions of the asymmetric imaginary part of the dispersion that
characterizes a typical resonance, resulting in a considerable enhancement of
the TPA rate. Due to the bosonic symmetry of TPA, the enhancement is strongest
when the resonance occurs when the frequency difference of the two photons is
much higher than the linewidth of the resonance. Our results indicate that
broadband entangled TPA with spectral phase flips may be suitable for
phase-sensitive spectroscopy at the lower end of the spectrum where direct
photon detection is difficult.

down-weighted during the training of the main model. However, assessing the

exoplanet detection in angular differential imaging (ADI) data sets. The
benchmarking of HCI algorithms within the Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge

performance by introducing new local processing approaches and adapting its

architecture that better captures image noise correlations by training an
independent SODINN model per noise regime over the processed frame. The
identification of these noise regimes is based on a novel technique, named
PCA-pmaps, which allows to estimate the distance from the star in the image
from which background noise starts to dominate over residual speckle noise.
NA-SODINN is also fed with local discriminators, such as S/N curves, which
complement spatio-temporal feature maps when training the model.Our new
approach is tested against its predecessor, as well as two SODINN-based hybrid
models and a more standard annular-PCA approach, through local ROC analysis of
ADI sequences from VLT/SPHERE and Keck/NIRC-2 instruments. Results show that
NA-SODINN enhances SODINN in both the sensitivity and specificity, especially
in the speckle-dominated noise regime. NA-SODINN is also benchmarked against
the complete set of submitted detection algorithms in EIDC, in which we show
that its final detection score matches or outperforms the most powerful
detection algorithms, reaching a performance similar to that of the Regime

Hypergraphs provide a higher dimensional generalization of a graph that is
capable of capturing multi-way connections. As such, they have become an
integral part of network science. A common use of hypergraphs is to model
events as hyperedges in which the event can involve many elements as nodes.
This provides a more complete picture of the event, which is not limited by the
standard dyadic connections of a graph. However, a common attribution to events
is temporal information as an interval for when the event occurred.
Consequently, a temporal hypergraph is born, which accurately captures both the
temporal information of events and their multi-way connections. Common tools
for studying these temporal hypergraphs typically capture changes in the
underlying dynamics with summary statistics of snapshots sampled in a sliding
window procedure. However, these tools do not characterize the evolution of
hypergraph structure over time, nor do they provide insight on persistent
components which are influential to the underlying system. To alleviate this
need, we leverage zigzag persistence from the field of Topological Data
Analysis (TDA) to study the change in topological structure of time-evolving

varying diffusivity and fractional order. We consider a symmetric integral form
of these nonlocal equations defined on general geometries and in arbitrary
bounded domains. A number of challenges are encountered when discretizing these
equations. The first comes from the heterogeneous kernel singularity in the
fractional integral operator. The second comes from the dense discrete operator
with its quadratic growth in memory footprint and arithmetic operations. An
additional challenge comes from the need to handle volume conditions-the
generalization of classical local boundary conditions to the nonlocal setting.
Satisfying these conditions requires that the effect of the whole domain,
including both the interior and exterior regions, can be computed on every
interior point in the discretization. Performed directly, this would result in
quadratic complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a strategy that
decomposes the stiffness matrix into three components. The first is a sparse
matrix that handles the singular near-field separately and is computed by
adapting singular quadrature techniques available for the homogeneous case to
the case of spatially variable order. The second component handles the
remaining smooth part of the near-field as well as the far-field and is
approximated by a hierarchical $\mathcal{H}^{2}$ matrix that maintains linear
complexity in storage and operations. The third component handles the effect of
the global mesh at every node and is written as a weighted mass matrix whose
density is computed by a fast-multipole type method. The resulting algorithm
has therefore overall linear space and time complexity. Analysis of the
consistency of the stiffness matrix is provided and numerical experiments are
conducted to illustrate the convergence and performance of the proposed
algorithm.

grids with few Network-Interfacing Converters (NICs) are a promising solution
to decrease installation costs and conversion losses compared to a pure AC
grid. However, interactions between the AC and DC subsystem of a hybrid AC/DC
grid can lead to undesirable amplification and propagation of harmonics. The
authors of this paper have recently proposed a Harmonic Power-Flow (HPF) method
that accurately represents the AC power flows including the coupling between
different harmonics. The HPF framework is formulated through the mismatch
equations of the nodal equations between the grid and the resource models and
solved by a Newton Raphson algorithm. This paper updates the HPF method to
model hybrid AC/DC grids interconnected through NICs. To this end, the model of
the NICs and the resulting coupling between the AC and DC subsystems is
included in the mismatch equations and the Jacobian matrix of the algorithm.
The updated HPF method is applied to a typical hybrid AC/DC grid, and its
accuracy is validated through detailed time-domain simulations with Simulink.

origins of sufficient amounts of ionising Lyman continuum (LyC) photons and the
mechanisms facilitating their transport into the IGM remains sparse. Recent
efforts have thus focussed on the study of local analogues to these
high-redshift objects.
  We used archival spectroscopic SDSS DR12 data to select a sample of low-z He
II 4686 emitters and restricted it to a set of SFGs with an emission line
diagnostic sensitive to the presence of an AGN, which serves as our only
selection criterion. Our final sample consists of eighteen low-mass,
low-metallicity dwarf galaxies which appear to be predominantly ionised by
stellar sources. We find large O32 ratios and [S II] deficiencies, which
provide strong indications for these galaxies to be LyC Emitters (LCEs). At
least 40% of these objects are candidates for featuring cosmologically
significant LyC escape fractions >10%. Their SFHs exhibit strong similarities
and almost all galaxies appear to contain an old (>1 Gyr) stellar component,
while also harbouring a young, two-stage (~10 Myr and <1 Myr) starburst, which
we speculate might be related to LyC escape.
  The properties of the compact emission line galaxies presented here align
well with those observed in many local LCEs. In fact, our sample may prove as
an extension to the rather small catalogue of local LCEs, as the extreme
interstellar medium (ISM) conditions we find are assumed to facilitate LyC
leakage. Notably, all of our eighteen candidates are significantly closer
(z<0.1) than most established LCEs. If the inferred LyC photon loss is genuine,
this demonstrates that selecting SFGs from He II 4686 is a powerful selection
criterion in the search for LCEs.

recent work proposes to make interpretable decisions by sequentially asking
interpretable queries about data until a prediction can be made with high

query-answer chains, a greedy procedure called Information Pursuit (IP) is
used, which adaptively chooses queries in order of information gain. Generative
models are employed to learn the distribution of query-answers and labels,
which is in turn used to estimate the most informative query. However, learning
and inference with a full generative model of the data is often intractable for
complex tasks. In this work, we propose Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP),
a variational characterization of IP which bypasses the need for learning
generative models. V-IP is based on finding a query selection strategy and a
classifier that minimizes the expected cross-entropy between true and predicted
labels. We then demonstrate that the IP strategy is the optimal solution to
this problem. Therefore, instead of learning generative models, we can use our
optimal strategy to directly pick the most informative query given any history.
We then develop a practical algorithm by defining a finite-dimensional
parameterization of our strategy and classifier using deep networks and train
them end-to-end using our objective. Empirically, V-IP is 10-100x faster than
IP on different Vision and NLP tasks with competitive performance. Moreover,
V-IP finds much shorter query chains when compared to reinforcement learning
which is typically used in sequential-decision-making problems. Finally, we
demonstrate the utility of V-IP on challenging tasks like medical diagnosis

Collaboration (HRC), increasing the contribution of robots to our daily tasks
and reducing the risk of injuries to the human operator. This approach usually
posits the human collaborator as the leader, while the robot has the follower

situation. However, when transporting a large object, the operator's
situational awareness can be compromised as the object may occlude different
parts of the environment. This paper proposes a novel haptic-based
environmental awareness module for a collaborative transportation framework
that informs the human operator about surrounding obstacles. The robot uses two
LIDARs to detect the obstacles in the surroundings. The warning module alerts
the operator through a haptic belt with four vibrotactile devices that provide
feedback about the location and proximity of the obstacles. By enhancing the
operator's awareness of the surroundings, the proposed module improves the
safety of the human-robot team in co-carrying scenarios by preventing
collisions. Experiments with two non-expert subjects in two different
situations are conducted. The results show that the human partner can
successfully lead the co-transportation system in an unknown environment with
hidden obstacles thanks to the haptic feedback.

can be written in MDRK format, the novel family constitutes a multistage
generalization. Two different alternatives are investigated for the computation
of the higher order derivatives: either directly as part of the stage equation,
or either as a separate formula for each derivative added on top of the stage
equation itself. From linearizing through Newton's method, it turns out that
the conditioning of the Newton matrix behaves significantly different for both
cases. We show that direct computation results in a matrix with a conditioning
that is highly dependent on the stiffness, increasing exponentially in the
stiffness parameter with the amount of derivatives. Adding separate formulas
has a more favorable behavior, the matrix conditioning being linearly dependent
on the stiffness, regardless of the amount of derivatives. Despite increasing
the Newton system significantly in size, through several numerical results it
is demonstrated that doing so can be considerably beneficial.

challenging due to the infiltrative nature of the lesion. Currently, no
real-time, intra-operative, label-free and wide-field tool is available to
assist and guide the surgeon to find the relevant demarcations for these
tumors. While marker-based methods exist for the high-grade glioma case, there
is no convenient solution available for the low-grade case; thus, marker-free
optical techniques represent an attractive option. Although RGB imaging is a
standard tool in surgical microscopes, it does not contain sufficient
information for tissue differentiation. We leverage the richer information from
hyperspectral imaging (HSI), acquired with a snapscan camera in the 468-787 nm
range, coupled to a surgical microscope, to build a deep-learning-based
diagnostic tool for cancer resection with potential for intra-operative
guidance. However, the main limitation of the HSI snapscan camera is the image
acquisition time, limiting its widespread deployment in the operation theater.
Here, we investigate the effect of HSI channel reduction and pre-selection to
scope the design space for the development of cheaper and faster sensors.
Neural networks are used to identify the most important spectral channels for
tumor tissue differentiation, optimizing the trade-off between the number of
channels and precision to enable real-time intra-surgical application. We
evaluate the performance of our method on a clinical dataset that was acquired
during surgery on five patients. By demonstrating the possibility to
efficiently detect low-grade glioma, these results can lead to better cancer
resection demarcations, potentially improving treatment effectiveness and
patient outcome.

gradient that indicates that they form inside-out. However, the
characterisation of the age of the NSD stellar population along the line of

interstellar extinction towards the Galactic centre. We aim to characterise the
age of the stellar population at different average Galactocentric NSD radii to
investigate for the first time the presence of an age gradient along the line
of sight. We selected two groups of stars at different NSD radii via their
different extinction and proper motion distribution. We analysed their stellar
population by fitting their de-reddened $K_s$ luminosity functions with a
linear combination of theoretical models. We find significant differences in
the stellar population at different NSD radii, indicating the presence of an

NSD contains a significant fraction ($\sim40 \%$ of its total stellar mass) of
intermediate-age stars (2-7 Gyr) that is not present in the sample from stars
deeper inside the NSD, in which $\sim90 \%$ of the stellar mass is older than 7
Gyr. Our results suggest that the NSD age distribution is similar to the one
found in external galaxies and they imply that bar-driven processes observed in
external galaxies are similarly at play in the Milky Way.

self-average around a diagonal matrix proportional to the identity. The

cybersickness detection methods are perceived as computationally intensive and
black-box methods. Thus, those techniques are neither trustworthy nor practical
for deploying on standalone energy-constrained VR head-mounted devices (HMDs).
In this work, we present an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework, LiteVR, for cybersickness detection, explaining the model's outcome
and reducing the feature dimensions and overall computational costs. First, we
develop three cybersickness DL models based on long-term short-term memory
(LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Then, we
employed a post-hoc explanation, such as SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP),
to explain the results and extract the most dominant features of cybersickness.
Finally, we retrain the DL models with the reduced number of features. Our
results show that eye-tracking features are the most dominant for cybersickness
detection. Furthermore, based on the XAI-based feature ranking and
dimensionality reduction, we significantly reduce the model's size by up to
4.3x, training time by up to 5.6x, and its inference time by up to 3.8x, with
higher cybersickness detection accuracy and low regression error (i.e., on Fast
Motion Scale (FMS)). Our proposed lite LSTM model obtained an accuracy of 94%
in classifying cybersickness and regressing (i.e., FMS 1-10) with a Root Mean
Square Error (RMSE) of 0.30, which outperforms the state-of-the-art. Our
proposed LiteVR framework can help researchers and practitioners analyze,
detect, and deploy their DL-based cybersickness detection models in standalone

rearranges the ranking list by modeling the mutual influence among items to
better meet users' demands. Many existing re-ranking methods directly take the
initial ranking list as input, and generate the optimal permutation through a
well-designed context-wise model, which brings the evaluation-before-reranking
problem. Meanwhile, evaluating all candidate permutations brings unacceptable
computational costs in practice. Thus, to better balance efficiency and
effectiveness, online systems usually use a two-stage architecture which uses
some heuristic methods such as beam-search to generate a suitable amount of
candidate permutations firstly, which are then fed into the evaluation model to
get the optimal permutation. However, existing methods in both stages can be
improved through the following aspects. As for generation stage, heuristic
methods only use point-wise prediction scores and lack an effective judgment.
As for evaluation stage, most existing context-wise evaluation models only
consider the item context and lack more fine-grained feature context modeling.
This paper presents a novel end-to-end re-ranking framework named PIER to
tackle the above challenges which still follows the two-stage architecture and
contains two mainly modules named FPSM and OCPM. We apply SimHash in FPSM to
select top-K candidates from the full permutation based on user's
permutation-level interest in an efficient way. Then we design a novel
omnidirectional attention mechanism in OCPM to capture the context information
in the permutation. Finally, we jointly train these two modules end-to-end by
introducing a comparative learning loss. Offline experiment results demonstrate
that PIER outperforms baseline models on both public and industrial datasets,

However, they are not able to predict the force at which the gripped object
starts to slip, which is critical as the object might be subjected to external
forces, e.g. when joining it with another object. This research project aims to
develop a AI-based approach for a grip metric based on tactile sensor data
capturing the physical interactions between gripper and object. Thus, the
maximum force that can be applied to the object before it begins to slip should
be predicted before manipulating the object. The RGB image of the contact

sensors during the initial phase of the grip should serve as a training input
for the grip metric. To generate such a data set, a pull experiment is designed
using a UR 5 robot. Performing these experiments in real life to populate the
data set is time consuming since different object classes, geometries, material
properties and surface textures need to be considered to enhance the robustness
of the prediction algorithm. Hence, a simulation model of the experimental
setup has been developed to both speed up and automate the data generation
process. In this paper, the design of this digital twin and the accuracy of the
synthetic data are presented. State-of-the-art image comparison algorithms show
that the simulated RGB images of the contact surface match the experimental
data. In addition, the maximum pull forces can be reproduced for different
object classes and grip scenarios. As a result, the synthetically generated
data can be further used to train the neural grip metric network.

performance degradation due to inter-job network interference. Topology-aware
job allocation problem (TJAP) is such a problem that decides how to dedicate
nodes to specific applications to mitigate inter-job network interference. In
this paper, we study the window-based TJAP on a fat-tree network aiming at
minimizing the cost of communication hop, a defined inter-job interference
metric. The window-based approach for scheduling repeats periodically taking
the jobs in the queue and solving an assignment problem that maps jobs to the
available nodes. Two special allocation strategies are considered, i.e., static
continuity assignment strategy (SCAS) and dynamic continuity assignment
strategy (DCAS). For the SCAS, a 0-1 integer programming is developed. For the
DCAS, an approach called neural simulated algorithm (NSA), which is an
extension to simulated algorithm (SA) that learns a repair operator and employs
them in a guided heuristic search, is proposed. The efficacy of NSA is
demonstrated with a computational study against SA and SCIP. The results of
numerical experiments indicate that both the model and algorithm proposed in
this paper are effective.

material can be a computationally daunting task, especially when dealing with
advanced constitutive models and fine mesh resolutions in the crystal
plasticity finite element method (CPFEM). Numerous studies have been conducted
regarding the sensitivity of material properties and performance to the mesh
resolution and choice of constitutive model. However, a unified approach that
accounts for various fidelity parameters, such as mesh resolutions, integration
time-steps, and constitutive models simultaneously is currently lacking. This
paper proposes a novel uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach for computing
the properties and performance of homogenized materials using CPFEM, that
exploits a hierarchy of approximations with different levels of fidelity. In
particular, we illustrate how multi-level sampling methods, such as multi-level
Monte Carlo (MLMC) and multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC), can be applied to assess
the impact of variations in the microstructure of polycrystalline materials on
the predictions of homogenized materials properties. We show that by adaptively
exploiting the fidelity hierarchy, we can significantly reduce the number of
microstructures required to reach a certain prescribed accuracy. Finally, we
show how our approach can be extended to a multi-fidelity framework, where we
allow the underlying constitutive model to be chosen from either a
phenomenological plasticity model or a dislocation-density-based model.

to describe the electromagnetic theory. The subsequent scholars studied the
physical properties of electromagnetic and gravitational fields simultaneously,
including the octonion linear momentum, angular momentum, torque and force
within the material media. According to the algebra of octonions, the scalar
parts of octonion physical quantities remain unchanged, while the vectorial

conserved quantities related to the vectorial magnitudes in the octonion space

concluded that some conserved quantities, relevant to the vectorial magnitudes,

fluid flow. This includes the turbulence modulation of the subgrid-scales by
the particles, which is taken into account by the modeled subgrid-scale stress

scales. Our new modeling framework combines a recently proposed model for
enriching the resolved fluid velocity with a subgrid-scale component, with the

Furthermore, we show that the change of subgrid-scale kinetic energy induced by

transport code fully written using the Geant4 toolkit. It aims at modeling
complex systems easily and rapidly, thanks to a simple key-value input file.
While its main focus is the transport of low energy neutrons -- below 20 MeV --
using evaluated cross-section libraries, it also takes advantage of the
state-of-the-art capabilities offered by Geant4 regarding the modeled
cross-sections for practically all particles at all energies. Hence it gives
access to non-specialists to a wide variety of applications involving different
particles, such as for instance the simulation of compact accelerator based
neutron sources (CANS) which initially motivated its development. It leverages
on recent implementations performed within Geant4 to provide both shielding
calculation capabilities (using Adaptive Multilevel Splitting, which is a fully
automated variance reduction technique) and criticality calculation
capabilities (to estimate the keff of a multiplicative system). It also
benefits from a tight coupling with CADMesh to readily import CAD models, with
NCrystal to extend the support of thermal neutron transport to crystals, with
FIFRELIN to increase compound nucleus de-excitation accuracy, and with FUNZ to
provide to the user parametric simulation capabilities (such as multi-objective
algorithms, calculation of Pareto sets, etc). Thanks to recent improvements of
the neutron physics within the Geant4 Neutron-HP package, the TOUCANS code can
be considered on-par with industrial neutron transport codes such as Tripoli-4
or MCNP in term of neutron physics accuracy. Its sources should be released
soon amongst Geant4 advanced examples.

  vaccine hesitancy in the SIR epidemic model",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Human behavior, and in particular vaccine hesitancy, is a critical factor for
the control of childhood infectious disease. Here we propose a spatio-temporal
behavioral epidemiology model where the vaccine propensity depends on
information that is non-local in space and in time. The properties of the
proposed model are analysed under different hypotheses on the spatio-temporal
kernels tuning the vaccination response of individuals. As a main result, we
could numerically show that vaccine hesitancy induces the onset of many dynamic
patterns of relevance for epidemiology. In particular we observed:
behavior-modulated patterns and spatio-temporal chaos. This is the first known
example of human behavior-induced spatio-temporal chaos in statistical physics
of vaccination. Patterns and spatio-temporal chaos are difficult to deal with,
from the Public Health viewpoint, hence showing that vaccine hesitancy can
cause them could be of interest. Additionally, we propose a new simple
heuristic algorithm to estimate the Maximum Lyapunov Exponent.

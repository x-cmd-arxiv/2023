  Australia using Machine Learning","17 pages, 12 figures",,,,"physics.data-an","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is used to indicate the
meteorological drought situation - a negative (or positive) value of SPI would
imply a dry (or wet) condition in a region over a period. The climate system is
an excellent example of a complex system since there is an interplay and
inter-relation of several climate variables. It is not always easy to identify
the factors that may influence the SPI, or their inter-relations (including
feedback loops). Here, we aim to study the complex dynamics that SPI has with
the SST, NINO 3.4 and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), using a machine learning
approach. Our findings are: (i) IOD was negatively correlated to SPI till 2008;
(ii) until 2004, SST was negatively correlated with SPI; (iii) from 2005 to
2014, the SST had swung between negative and positive correlations; (iv) since
2014, we observed that the regression coefficient ($\delta$) corresponding to
SST has always been positive; (v) the SST has an upward trend, and the positive
upward trend of $\delta$ implied that SPI has been positively correlated with
SST in recent years; and finally, (vi) the current value of SPI has a
significant positive correlation with a past SPI value with a periodicity of
about 7.5 years. Examining the complex dynamics, we used a statistical machine
learning approach to construct an inferential network of these climate
variables, which revealed that SST and NINO 3.4 directly couples with SPI,
whereas IOD indirectly couples with SPI through SST and NINO 3.4. The system
also indicated that Nino 3.4 has a significant negative effect on SPI.
Interestingly, there seems to be a structural change in the complex dynamics of
the four climate variables, some time in 2008. Though a simple 12-month moving
average of SPI has a negative trend towards drought, the complex dynamics of
SPI with other climate variables indicate a wet season for western Australia.

the addition of a large number of complex cores have also increased the overall

modern processors. While we can limit power consumption by simply applying
software-based power constraints, applying them blindly will lead to
non-trivial performance degradation. To address the challenge of improving the
performance, power, and energy efficiency of scientific applications on modern
multi-core processors, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network based
auto-tuning approach that (i) optimizes runtime performance at pre-defined
power constraints, and (ii) simultaneously optimizes for runtime performance
and energy efficiency by minimizing the energy-delay product. The key idea
behind this approach lies in modeling parallel code regions as flow-aware code
graphs to capture both semantic and structural code features. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our approach by conducting an extensive evaluation on $30$
benchmarks and proxy-/mini-applications with $68$ OpenMP code regions. Our
approach identifies OpenMP configurations at different power constraints that
yield a geometric mean performance improvement of more than $25\%$ and $13\%$
over the default OpenMP configuration on a 32-core Skylake and a $16$-core

demonstrate both performance improvement of $21\%$ and $11\%$ and energy
reduction of $29\%$ and $18\%$ over the default OpenMP configuration at Thermal

of randomization as a resource to develop improved algorithms for large-scale
linear algebra computations.
  The origins of contemporary RandNLA lay in theoretical computer science,
where it blossomed from a simple idea: randomization provides an avenue for
computing approximate solutions to linear algebra problems more efficiently
than deterministic algorithms. This idea proved fruitful in the development of
scalable algorithms for machine learning and statistical data analysis
applications. However, RandNLA's true potential only came into focus upon
integration with the fields of numerical analysis and ""classical"" numerical
linear algebra. Through the efforts of many individuals, randomized algorithms
have been developed that provide full control over the accuracy of their
solutions and that can be every bit as reliable as algorithms that might be
found in libraries such as LAPACK. Recent years have even seen the
incorporation of certain RandNLA methods into MATLAB, the NAG Library, NVIDIA's
cuSOLVER, and SciKit-Learn.
  For all its success, we believe that RandNLA has yet to realize its full
potential. In particular, we believe the scientific community stands to benefit
significantly from suitably defined ""RandBLAS"" and ""RandLAPACK"" libraries, to
serve as standards conceptually analogous to BLAS and LAPACK. This 200-page
monograph represents a step toward defining such standards. In it, we cover

edges), node degrees have also played an important role. They have
traditionally either appeared as an objective, to minimize the maximum degree

be violated to give bicriteria approximations (e.g., the Minimum Cost Degree
Bounded Spanning Tree problem). We extend the study of degrees in network
design in two ways. First, we introduce and study a new variant of the
Survivable Network Design Problem where in addition to the traditional

the $\ell_p$-norm of the node degree vector is bounded by an input parameter.
This interpolates between the classical settings of maximum degree (the
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm) and the number of edges (the $\ell_1$-degree), and has
natural applications in distributed systems and VLSI design. We give a constant
bicriteria approximation in both measures using convex programming. Second, we

  through Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered industrial fault diagnostics is
important in ensuring the safe operation of industrial applications. Since
complex industrial systems often involve multiple industrial plants (possibly
belonging to different companies or subsidiaries) with sensitive data collected
and stored in a distributed manner, collaborative fault diagnostic model
training often needs to leverage federated learning (FL). As the scale of the
industrial fault diagnostic models are often large and communication channels
in such systems are often not exclusively used for FL model training, existing
deployed FL model training frameworks cannot train such models efficiently
across multiple institutions. In this paper, we report our experience
developing and deploying the Federated Opportunistic Block Dropout (FEDOBD)
approach for industrial fault diagnostic model training. By decomposing
large-scale models into semantic blocks and enabling FL participants to
opportunistically upload selected important blocks in a quantized manner, it
significantly reduces the communication overhead while maintaining model
performance. Since its deployment in ENN Group in February 2022, FEDOBD has
served two coal chemical plants across two cities in China to build industrial
fault prediction models. It helped the company reduce the training
communication overhead by over 70% compared to its previous AI Engine, while
maintaining model performance at over 85% test F1 score. To our knowledge, it
is the first successfully deployed dropout-based FL approach.

activities. Bus transit systems are widely considered in drive-by sensing due
to extensive spatial coverage, reliable operations, and low maintenance costs.
It is critical for the underlying monitoring scenario (e.g. air quality,
traffic state, and road roughness) to assign a limited number of sensors to a
bus fleet to ensure their optimal spatial-temporal distribution. In this paper
we present a trip-based sensor allocation problem, which explicitly considers
timetabled trips that must be executed by the fleet while a portion of them
perform sensing tasks. To address the computational challenge in large-scale

the model complexity by decoupling the spatial-temporal structures of the

demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in solving large-scale problems. It
is found that coordinating bus scheduling and sensing tasks can substantially
increase the spatial-temporal sensing coverage. We also provide a few model

conclusion reached in these papers is that pairs are observed to nucleate at

similar conclusion should apply to bubble nucleation in a false vacuum. This
conclusion however is subject to doubt due to the unphysical nature of the

number density of pairs in such a field would be infinite at any finite time.
Here we address the same question in a more realistic model where the electric

on the field breaks the Lorentz invariance of the model and could in principle
influence the frame of pair nucleation. We find however that the conclusion of

elongate bodies in 3-D to interact with the terrain. Similarly, a snake robot
is a promising platform to perform critical tasks in various environments.
Understanding how 3-D body bending effectively interacts with the terrain for
propulsion and stability can not only inform how snakes traverse natural
environments, but also allow snake robots to achieve similar performance.
  How snakes and snake robots move on flat surfaces has been understood well.
However, such ideal terrain is rare in natural environments and little was
understood about how to generate propulsion and maintain stability in 3-D
terrain, except for some studies on arboreal snake locomotion and on robots
using geometric planning. To bridge the knowledge gap, we integrated animal
experiments and robotic studies in three representative environments: a large
smooth step, an uneven arena of blocks of large height variation, and large
bumps.
  We discovered that vertical body bending induces stability challenges but can
generate large propulsion. When traversing a large smooth step, a snake robot
is challenged by roll instability that increases with the amplitude of vertical
bending. The instability can be reduced by body compliance that statistically
improves body-terrain contact. Despite this, vertical body bending can
potentially allow snakes to push against terrain for propulsion, as
demonstrated by corn snakes traversing an uneven arena. A snake robot can
generate large propulsion like this if contact is well maintained. Contact
feedback control can help accommodate perturbations such as novel terrain
geometry or excessive external forces by improving contact. Our findings
provide insights into how snakes and snake robots can use vertical body bending
for efficient and versatile traversal of the 3-D world stably.

spectrum at $5<z<6$ using the SKA-Low radio telescope in presence of
foregrounds and instrumental effects. We simulate observations of the
inherently weak HI signal post-reionization with varying levels of noise and
contamination with foreground amplitudes equivalent to residuals after sky
model subtraction. We find that blind signal separation methods on imaged data
are required in order to recover the HI signal at large cosmological scales.
Comparing different methods of foreground cleaning, we find that Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) performs better than Principle Component Analysis
(PCA), with the key difference being that GPR uses smooth kernels for the total
data covariance. The integration time of one field needs to be larger than
$\sim 250$ hours to provide large enough signal-to-noise ratio to accurately
model the data covariance for foreground cleaning. Images within the primary
beam field-of-view give measurements of the HI power spectrum at scales $k\sim
0.02\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}-0.3\,{\rm Mpc^{-1} }$ with signal-to-noise ratio $\sim
2-5$ in $\Delta[{\rm log}( k/{\rm Mpc^{-1}})] = 0.25$ bins assuming an
integration time of 600 hours. Systematic effects, which introduce small-scale
fluctuations across frequency channels, need to be $\lesssim 1\%$ to enable
unbiased measurements outside the foreground wedge. Our results provide an
important validation towards using the SKA-Low array for measuring the HI power

and estimating the average causal effect of a binary treatment on an outcome.
We consider a setup in which the outcome realization does not get immediately

empirical settings. The period between the treatment and the realization of the
outcome allows other observed actions to occur and affect the outcome. In this
context, we study several regression-based estimands routinely used in
empirical work to capture the average treatment effect and shed light on
interpreting them in terms of ceteris paribus effects, indirect causal effects,
and selection terms. We obtain three main and related takeaways. First, the
three most popular estimands do not generally satisfy what we call strong sign
preservation, in the sense that these estimands may be negative even when the
treatment positively affects the outcome conditional on any possible
combination of other actions. Second, the most popular regression that includes
the other actions as controls satisfies strong sign preservation if and only if
these actions are mutually exclusive binary variables. Finally, we show that a
linear regression that fully stratifies the other actions leads to estimands
that satisfy strong sign preservation.

to one with a lower dimension. The result is a space which requires less
physical memory and has a faster distance calculation. These techniques are
widely used where required properties of the reduced-dimension space give an
acceptable accuracy with respect to the original space. Many such transforms
have been described. They have been classified in two main groups: linear and
topological. Linear methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
Random Projection (RP) define matrix-based transforms into a lower dimension of
Euclidean space. Topological methods such as Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
attempt to preserve higher-level aspects such as the nearest-neighbour
relation, and some may be applied to non-Euclidean spaces. Here, we introduce
nSimplex Zen, a novel topological method of reducing dimensionality. Like MDS,
it relies only upon pairwise distances measured in the original space. The use
of distances, rather than coordinates, allows the technique to be applied to
both Euclidean and other Hilbert spaces, including those governed by Cosine,
Jensen-Shannon and Quadratic Form distances. We show that in almost all cases,

recount selected experiences from previous tasks to avoid catastrophic
forgetting. Furthermore, selective experience replay based techniques are model
agnostic and allow experiences to be shared across different models. However,
storing experiences from all previous tasks make lifelong learning using
selective experience replay computationally very expensive and impractical as

experience replay buffers stored for selective experience replay.
  We evaluated the coreset compression technique on the brain tumor

whole-body MRI for localization of left knee cap, left kidney, right

on a sequence of 10 different brain MR imaging environments demonstrated
excellent performance localizing the ventricle with a mean pixel error distance
of 12.93 for the compression ratio of 10x. In comparison, the conventional

10.87. Similarly, the coreset lifelong learning models trained on whole-body

environment for the production of $B_c$ mesons, due to a much larger abundance
of charm and bottom quarks compared to elementary reactions. Motivated by
recent CMS data for $B_c^+$ production in Pb-Pb($5.02\,$TeV) collisions at the
LHC, we deploy a previously developed transport approach for charmonia and
bottomonia to evaluate the kinetics of $B_c$ mesons throughout the fireball
formed in these reactions. The main inputs to our approach are two transport
parameters: the $B_c$'s reaction rate and equilibrium limit. Both quantities
are determined by previous calculations via a combination of charm and bottom
sectors. In-medium binding energies of $B_c$ mesons are calculated from a
thermodynamic $T$-matrix with a lattice-QCD constrained potential, and figure
in their inelastic reaction rates. Temperature-dependent equilibrium limits
include charm- and bottom-quark fugacities based on their initial production.
We compute the centrality dependence of inclusive $B_c$ production and
transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra using two different recombination models,
instantaneous coalescence and resonance recombination. The main uncertainty in
the resulting nuclear modification factors, $R_{\rm AA}$, is currently
associated with the $B_c$ cross section in elementary $pp$ collisions, caused
by the uncertainty in the branching ratio for the $B_c^-\to J/\psi\mu^-\bar
\nu$ decay. Our results indicate a large enhancement of the $R_{\rm AA}$ at low
$p_T$, with significant regeneration contributions up to $p_T\simeq\,20\,$GeV.
Comparisons to CMS data are carried out but firm conclusions will require a
more accurate value of the branching ratio, or alternative channels to measure

Maximizing the Bell expression with these measurements leads to the violations

utility of our strategy in a realistic setting of cavity quantum
electrodynamics, where an atom interacts with a single mode of an
electromagnetic field under the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. We dynamically
compute the quenched averaged value of hybrid nonlocality in imperfect

the disordered case, we introduce two kinds of measurement scenarios to
determine the Bell statistics -- in one situation, experimentalists can tune
the optimal settings according to the interaction strength while such
controlled power is absent in the other case. In contrast to the oscillatory
behavior observed in the ordered case, the quenched averaged violation
saturates to a finite value in some parameter regimes in the former case,
thereby highlighting an advantage of disordered systems. We also examine the

their rapidly-growing scale. This motivates the use of parameter-efficient
adaptation methods such as prompt tuning (PT), which adds a small number of
tunable embeddings to an otherwise frozen model, and in-context learning (ICL),
in which demonstrations of the task are provided to the model in natural
language without any additional training. Recently, Singhal et al. (2022)
propose ``instruction prompt tuning'' (IPT), which combines PT with ICL by
concatenating a natural language demonstration with learned prompt embeddings.
While all of these methods have proven effective on different tasks, how they
interact with each other remains unexplored. In this paper, we empirically
study when and how in-context examples improve prompt tuning by measuring the
effectiveness of ICL, PT, and IPT on five text generation tasks with multiple
base language models. We observe that (1) IPT does \emph{not} always outperform
PT, and in fact requires the in-context demonstration to be semantically
similar to the test input to yield improvements; (2) PT is unstable and
exhibits high variance, but combining PT and ICL (into IPT) consistently
reduces variance across all five tasks; and (3) prompts learned for a specific
source task via PT exhibit positive transfer when paired with in-context
examples of a different target task. Our results offer actionable insights on
choosing a suitable parameter-efficient adaptation method for a given task.

existing experiments and theoretically validated by Boltzmann in 1884 on the
basis of a classical model involving thermodynamics principles and the Maxwell
equations. At first sight the electromagnetic (EM) gas assumed by Boltzmann and
identifiable as an ensemble of $N$ classical normal-modes, looks like an
extension of the classical model of the massive ideal-gas. Accordingly, for
this EM gas the internal total energy, $U$, was taken to be function of volume
$V$ and temperature $T$ as $U=U(V,T)$, and the equation of state was given by
$U=3PV$, with $P$ the radiation pressure. In addition, Boltzmann implicitly
assumed that, for given values of $V$ and $T$, $U$ and $N$ would take finite
values. However, from one hand these assumptions are not justified by Maxwell
equations since, in vacuum (i.e. far from the EM sources), according to
classical statistics, the values of $U$and $N$ diverge. From another hand,
Boltzmann derivation of Stefan law is found to be macroscopically compatible
with its derivation from quantum statistics announced by Planck in 1901.
Accordingly, this letter presents a solution of this puzzling classical/quantum
compatibility by noticing that the implicit assumption made by Boltzmann is
fully justified by quantum statistics. Furthermore, we shed new light on the
interpretation of recent classical simulations of a black-body carried out by
Wang, Casati, and Benenti in 2022 who found an analogous puzzling compatibility
to induce speculations on classical physics and black-body radiation that are
claimed to require a critical reconsideration of the role of classical physics
for the understanding of quantum mechanics.

inter- and intra-subject variability, making segmentation a quite challenging
task. Our study of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) segmentation network, U-Net, for
the problem reveals that it often fails to capture the salient characteristics
of UB due to the varying shape and scales of anatomy in the noisy US image.
Also, U-net has an excessive number of trainable parameters, reporting poor
computational efficiency during training. We propose a Slim U-Net to address
the challenges of UB segmentation. Slim U-Net proposes to efficiently preserve
the salient features of UB by reshaping the structure of U-Net using a less
number of 2D convolution layers in the contracting path, in order to preserve
and impose them on expanding path. To effectively distinguish the blurred
boundaries, we propose a novel annotation methodology, which includes the
background area of the image at the boundary of a marked region of interest
(RoI), thereby steering the model's attention towards boundaries. In addition,
we suggested a combination of loss functions for network training in the
complex segmentation of UB. The experimental results demonstrate that Slim
U-net is statistically superior to U-net for UB segmentation. The Slim U-net
further decreases the number of trainable parameters and training time by 54%

to develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring

these challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented

positive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from
routing and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular

(for the chores) are supermodular set functions with binary marginals. Such
functions capture complementarity among chores, i.e., they constitute an
expressive class wherein the marginal disutility of each chore is either one or
zero, and the marginals increase with respect to supersets. In this setting, we
study the broad landscape of finding fair and efficient chore allocations. In
particular, we establish the existence of $(i)$ EF1 and Pareto efficient chore
allocations, $(ii)$ MMS-fair and Pareto efficient allocations, and $(iii)$
Lorenz dominating chore allocations. Furthermore, we develop polynomial-time
algorithms--in the value oracle model--for computing the chore allocations for
each of these fairness and efficiency criteria. Complementing these existential
and algorithmic results, we show that in this chore division setting, the
aforementioned fairness notions, namely EF1, MMS, and Lorenz domination are
incomparable: an allocation that satisfies any one of these notions does not
necessarily satisfy the others.
  Additionally, we study EFX chore division. In contrast to the above-mentioned
positive results, we show that, for binary supermodular costs, Pareto efficient
allocations that are even approximately EFX do not exist, for any arbitrarily

optimization of dose, dose rate, and LET for FLASH treatment planning. Finding
solutions to IPO-IMPT is difficult due to computational intensiveness.
Nevertheless, an inverse solution that simultaneously specifies the geometry of
a sparse filter and weights of a proton intensity map is desirable for both
clinical and preclinical applications. Such solutions can reduce effective
biological dose to organs at risk in cancer patients as well as reduce the
number of animal irradiations needed to derive extra biological dose models in
preclinical studies.
  Methods:Unlike our initial forward heuristic, this inverse IPO-IMPT solution
includes simultaneous optimization of sparse range compensation, sparse range
modulation, and spot intensity. The daunting computational tasks vital to this
endeavor were resolved iteratively with a distributed computing framework to
enable Simultaneous Intensity and Energy Modulation and Compensation (SIEMAC).
SIEMAC was demonstrated on a human lung cancer patient and a minipig.
  Results:SIEMAC improves maps of spot intensities and patient-field-specific
sparse range compensators and range modulators. For the lung cancer patient, at
our max nozzle current of 300 nA, dose rate coverage above 100 Gy/s increased
from 57% to 96% in the lung and from 93% to 100% in the heart, and LET coverage
above 4 keV/um dropped from 68% to 9% in the lung and from 26% to <1% in the
heart. For a simple minipig plan, the FWHM of the dose, dose rate, and LET
distributions decreased by 30%, 1.6%, and 57%, respectively, again with similar
target dose coverage, thus reducing uncertainty in these quantities for
preclinical studies.
  Conclusion:The inverse solution to IPO-IMPT demonstrated the capability to
simultaneously modulate sub-spot proton energy and intensity distributions for
clinical and preclinical studies.

system, however the physical mechanisms driving and transporting this energetic
release are not fully understood. An important signature associated with flare
energy release is highly variable emission on timescales of sub-seconds to
minutes which often exhibit oscillatory behaviour, features collectively known
as quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs). To fully identify the driving mechanism of
QPPs, exploit their potential as a diagnostic tool, and incorporate them into
our understanding of solar and stellar flares, new observational capabilities
and initiatives are required. There is a clear community need for
flare-focused, rapid cadence, high resolution, multi-wavelength imaging of the
Sun, with high enough sensitivity and dynamic range to observe small
fluctuations in intensity in the presence of a large overall intensity.
Furthermore, multidisciplinary funding and initiatives are required to narrow
the gap between numerical models and observations. QPPs are direct signatures
of the physics occurring in flare magnetic reconnection and energy release
sites and hence are critical to include in a unified flare model. Despite
significant modelling and theoretical work, no single mechanism or model can
fully explain the presence of QPPs in flares. Moreover, it is also likely that
QPPs fall into different categories that are produced by different mechanisms.
At present we have insufficient information to observationally distinguish
between mechanisms. The motivation to understand QPPs is strengthened by the
geo-effectiveness of flares on the Earth's ionosphere, and by the fact that
stellar flares exhibit similar QPP signatures. QPPs present a golden
opportunity to better understand flare physics and exploit the solar-stellary
analogy, benefiting both astrophysics, heliophysics, and the solar-terrestrial
connection.

perform a variety of manipulation tasks and generalize to novel scenarios. One
of the key contributing factors to this progress is the scale of robot data
used to train the models. To obtain large-scale datasets, prior approaches have
relied on either demonstrations requiring high human involvement or
engineering-heavy autonomous data collection schemes, both of which are
challenging to scale. To mitigate this issue, we propose an alternative route
and leverage text-to-image foundation models widely used in computer vision and
natural language processing to obtain meaningful data for robot learning
without requiring additional robot data. We term our method Robot Learning with
Semantically Imagened Experience (ROSIE). Specifically, we make use of the
state of the art text-to-image diffusion models and perform aggressive data
augmentation on top of our existing robotic manipulation datasets via
inpainting various unseen objects for manipulation, backgrounds, and
distractors with text guidance. Through extensive real-world experiments, we
show that manipulation policies trained on data augmented this way are able to
solve completely unseen tasks with new objects and can behave more robustly
w.r.t. novel distractors. In addition, we find that we can improve the
robustness and generalization of high-level robot learning tasks such as
success detection through training with the diffusion-based data augmentation.

objects (i.e., soft objects with rigid cores such as avocados or mangos). In
contrast to prior works using open-loop cutting actions to cut through
single-material objects (e.g., slicing a cucumber), RoboNinja aims to remove
the soft part of an object while preserving the rigid core, thereby maximizing
the yield. To achieve this, our system closes the perception-action loop by
utilizing an interactive state estimator and an adaptive cutting policy. The
system first employs sparse collision information to iteratively estimate the
position and geometry of an object's core and then generates closed-loop
cutting actions based on the estimated state and a tolerance value. The
""adaptiveness"" of the policy is achieved through the tolerance value, which
modulates the policy's conservativeness when encountering collisions,
maintaining an adaptive safety distance from the estimated core. Learning such
cutting skills directly on a real-world robot is challenging. Yet, existing
simulators are limited in simulating multi-material objects or computing the
energy consumption during the cutting process. To address this issue, we
develop a differentiable cutting simulator that supports multi-material
coupling and allows for the generation of optimized trajectories as
demonstrations for policy learning. Furthermore, by using a low-cost force
sensor to capture collision feedback, we were able to successfully deploy the
learned model in real-world scenarios, including objects with diverse core
geometries and soft materials.

Recent seminal works (Xu et al., 2019; Morris et al., 2019b) introduced the

this hierarchy has propelled significant advances in GNN analysis and
architecture developments, it suffers from several significant limitations.
These include a complex definition that lacks direct guidance for model

of GNNs to calculate equivariant polynomials of a certain degree. As a first
step, we provide a full characterization of all equivariant graph polynomials

Each basis element corresponds to a specific multi-graph, and its computation
over some graph data input corresponds to a tensor contraction problem. Second,
we propose algorithmic tools for evaluating the expressiveness of GNNs using
tensor contraction sequences, and calculate the expressive power of popular
GNNs. Finally, we enhance the expressivity of common GNN architectures by
adding polynomial features or additional operations / aggregations inspired by
our theory. These enhanced GNNs demonstrate state-of-the-art results in

firstly, we created a large-scale dataset called the MVBSL-W50, which comprises
50 isolated words across 13 categories. Secondly, we developed an
attention-based Bi-GRU model that captures the temporal dynamics of pose
information for individuals communicating through sign language. The proposed
model utilizes human pose information, which has shown to be successful in
analyzing sign language patterns. By focusing solely on movement information

simplified and can achieve a speedier performance. The accuracy of the model is

certain social groups and present bias. Understanding bias in these models
remains an important research question, especially for tasks that support
critical decision-making and could affect minorities. The contribution of this
work is a novel analysis covering architectures and embedding spaces for
fine-grained understanding of bias over three approaches: generators, attribute
modifier, and post-processing bias mitigators. This work shows that generators
suffer from bias across all social groups with attribute preferences such as
between 75%-85% for whiteness and 60%-80% for the female gender (for all
trained CelebA models) and low probabilities of generating children and older
men. Modifier and mitigators work as post-processor and change the generator
performance. For instance, attribute channel perturbation strategies modify the
embedding spaces. We quantify the influence of this change on group fairness by
measuring the impact on image quality and group features. Specifically, we use
the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), the Face Matching Error and the
Self-Similarity score. For Interfacegan, we analyze one and two attribute
channel perturbations and examine the effect on the fairness distribution and
the quality of the image. Finally, we analyzed the post-processing bias
mitigators, which are the fastest and most computationally efficient way to
mitigate bias. We find that these mitigation techniques show similar results on
KL divergence and FID score, however, self-similarity scores show a different
feature concentration on the new groups of the data distribution. The
weaknesses and ongoing challenges described in this work must be considered in

temporary amplification of disturbances even when the linearized system is
asymptotically stable as defined by its eigenvalues. This growth is
traditionally quantified by finding the initial disturbance that generates the
maximum response, in terms of energy gain, at the peak time of its evolution.
While this bounds the growth, it can vastly overstate the growth of a real
disturbance. In this paper, we introduce a statistical perspective on transient
growth that models statistics of the energy amplification of the disturbances.
We derive a formula for the mean energy amplification in terms of the two-point
spatial correlation of the initial disturbance. We also derive an accurate
approximation of the probability density function of the energy of the growing
disturbance, from which confidence bounds on the growth can be obtained.
Applying our analysis to Poisseuille flow yields a number of observations.
First, the mean gain can be drastically smaller than the maximum, especially
when the disturbances are broadband in wavenumber content. In these cases, it
is exceedingly unlikely to achieve near-optimal growth due to the exponential
behavior which we observe in the probability density function. Second, the
characteristic length scale of the initial disturbances has a significant
impact on the expected growth; specifically, large-scale initial disturbances
produce orders-of-magnitude-larger expected growth than smaller scales,
indicating that the length scale of incoming disturbances may be key in
determining whether transient growth leads to transition for a particular flow.
Finally, while the optimal growth scales quadratically with Reynolds number, we
observe that the mean energy amplification scales only linearly for certain
reasonable choices of the initial correlations.

(linkage and direction). Points are associated with observed scores on the
strength of evidence for each transmission status that are obtained through
standard deep-sequenece phylogenetic analysis. Our method is able to jointly
infer the latent transmission statuses for all pairings and the transmission

methods, our framework does not require pre-classification of the transmission
statuses of data points, instead learning them probabilistically through a

advantages compared to previous methods that rely on discretization of the

identifying the ore indicator regions. Both magnetometry and gamma-rays are

key variable for tonnage estimation in mining and needs to be re-estimated in
areas of change when a boundary update has been conducted. Modelling these
geophysical variables in 3D will enable investigate the properties of the rocks
and improve our understanding of the ore. Gaussian Process (GP) was previously
used to generate 3D spatial models for grade estimation using geochemical
assays. This study investigates the influence of the following two factors on
the GP-based autonomously generated 3D geophysical models: the resolution of
the input data and the number of nearest samples used in the training process.

or the concentration of reactants, and/or via use of a catalyst or an enzyme.
Whereas the former increases the probability of collision rate between
different molecules, the latter provides an alternate reaction path that
diminishes the activation energy barrier for reaction, both effects increase
the reaction rate. The deformability of the substrate on which a reaction
occurs is not known to affect this rate. In contrast, by carrying out reduction
of Gold and Silver salt on soft, crosslinked layers of poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS), we show here that surface tension driven deformation of the solid too
can increase the reaction rate. The PDMS contains SiH groups as organosilanes
which reduces the salt thereby producing the corresponding metallic
nano-particles. When an aqueous solution of the salt is dispensed as a sessile
drop on a sufficiently soft PDMS layer, nano-particles get generated at ~3
times the rate over which when the salt solution is dispensed as a pool on the
same surface. Unlike the pool, the drop has a three-phase contact line, where
it pulls up the solid forming a ridge. By balancing the resultant surface
stresses at the vicinity of this ridge, we have estimated the excess surface
free energy associated with it. We show that this excess energy can diminish
the activation energy barrier and increase the reaction rate to the extent that
would have been achieved by increasing the reaction temperature by over 30o C.

Hamiltonian problem, which we call 'Guidable Local Hamiltonian' problems.
Unlike their guided counterparts, these problems do not have a guiding state
provided as a part of the input, but merely come with the promise that one
exists and that it satisfies certain constraints. We consider in particular two
classes of guiding states: those that can be prepared efficiently by a quantum
circuit; and those belonging to a class of quantum states we call classically
evaluatable, which have a short classical description from which it is possible
to efficiently compute expectation values of local observables classically. We
show that guidable local Hamiltonian problems for both classes of guiding
states are $\mathsf{QCMA}$-complete in the inverse-polynomial precision
setting, but lie within $\mathsf{NP}$ (or $\mathsf{NqP}$) in certain parameter
regimes when the guiding state is classically evaluatable.
  We discuss the implications of these results to heuristic ans\""atze state
preparation and the quantum PCP conjecture. Our completeness results show that,
from a complexity-theoretic perspective, classical ans\""atze prepared by
classical heuristics are just as powerful as quantum ans\""atze prepared by
quantum heuristics, so long as one has access to quantum phase estimation. In
relation to the quantum PCP conjecture, we (i) define a PCP for $\mathsf{QCMA}$
and show that it is equal to $\mathsf{NP}$ under quantum reductions; (ii) show
several no-go results for the existence of quantum gap amplification procedures
that preserve certain ground state properties; and (iii) propose two
conjectures that can be viewed as stronger versions of the NLTS theorem.
Finally, we show that many of our results can be directly modified to obtain
similar results for the class $\mathsf{MA}$.

radiation in the Universe. Primordial nucleosynthesis (BBN) provides strong
evidence that the early Universe contained a hot plasma of photons and baryons
with a temperature $T>\text{MeV}$. However, the earliest probes of dark matter
originate from much later times around the epoch of structure formation. In
this work we describe a scenario in which dark matter (and possibly dark
radiation) can be formed around or even after BBN in a second Big Bang which we
dub the ``Dark Big Bang''. The latter occurs through a phase transition in the
dark sector which transforms dark vacuum energy into a hot dark plasma of
particles; in this paper we focus on a first-order phase transition for the
Dark Big Bang. The correct dark matter abundance can be set by dark matter
cannibalism or by pair-annihilation within the dark sector followed by a
thermal freeze-out. Alternatively ultra-heavy ``dark-zilla'' dark matter can
originate directly from bubble collisions during the Dark Big Bang. We will
show that the Dark Big Bang is consistent with constraints from structure
formation and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) if it occurred when the
Universe was less than one month old, corresponding to a temperature in the
visible sector above $\mathcal{O}$(keV). While the dark matter evades direct
and indirect detection, the Dark Big Bang gives rise to striking gravity wave
signatures to be tested at pulsar timing array experiments. Furthermore, the
Dark Big Bang allows for realizations of self-interacting and/or warm dark
matter which suggest exciting discovery potential in future small-scale
structure observations.

set of models for the fermion masses, we select those where a symmetry-breaking
order parameter sits at a transition point between a disordered phase and an
ordered one. Many models based on ordinary flavor symmetries are formulated in
terms of small corrections to a symmetric limit, which can hardly be
interpreted unambiguously as a sign of near-criticality. Different is the case
of nonlinearly realized flavor symmetries when the system is always in the
broken phase. By inspecting a large number of modular and CP invariant models
of lepton masses, we find that most of them cluster around the fixed point
$\tau= i$, where the system enjoys enhanced symmetry. Since a priori all values
of the modulus $\tau$ are equally acceptable to describe the fermion spectrum,
we regard this preference as a hint of near-criticality. We analyze in detail
these models in the vicinity of all fixed points, showing that only one
possibility provides a good description of neutrino masses and mixing angles.
Near the fixed points the models exhibit a universal behavior. Mass ratios and
mixing angles scale with appropriate powers of the order parameter,
independently of the details of the theory, a feature reminiscent of systems
belonging to the same universality class in second-order phase transitions. The
observations of this work are inspired by the role near-criticality might play
in solving the naturalness problem and are motivated by the fascinating
possibility that most of the free parameters of the Standard Model could find a
common explanation.

$W\rightarrow \tau\nu_\tau$ and $Z \to \nu_\tau \nu_\tau$ due to integrating
out a pseudo-Dirac singlet fermion required by the model for neutrino mass
generation. At loop level, the new colored states of the model generate large

leading- and next-to-leading log running effects, yielding a significant
improvement in the electroweak fit (including an increase in the $W$-boson

chemical evolution of the interstellar medium by leading to the formation of
complex organic molecules and by inducing photodesorption. So far, the focus of
laboratory studies has been mainly on the impact of energetic ultraviolet (UV)
photons on ices, but direct vibrational excitation by infrared (IR) photons is
expected to influence the morphology and content of interstellar ices as well.
However, little is still known about the mechanisms through which this excess
vibrational energy is dissipated, and its implications on the structure and ice
photochemistry. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of the
behavior of interstellar relevant CO and CH3OH ice analogues upon resonant
excitation of vibrational modes using tunable infrared radiation, leading to
both the quantification of infrared-induced photodesorption and insights in the
impact of vibrational energy dissipation on ice morphology. We utilize an
ultrahigh vacuum setup at cryogenic temperatures to grow pure CO and CH3OH
ices, as well as mixtures of the two. We expose the ices to intense,
near-monochromatic mid-infrared free-electron-laser radiation to selectively
excite the species. The dissipation of vibrational energy is observed to be
highly dependent on the excited mode and the chemical environment of the ice.
All amorphous ices undergo some degree of restructuring towards a more
organized configuration upon on-resonance irradiation. Moreover, IR-induced
photodesorption is observed to occur for both pure CO and CH3OH ices, with
interstellar photodesorption efficiencies of the order of 10 molecules cm-2 s-1
(i.e., comparable to or higher than UV-induced counterparts). Indirect
photodesorption of CO upon vibrational excitation of CH3OH in ice mixtures is
also observed to occur, particularly in environments rich in methanol.

1"", 0.05"", and 0.25"", respectively, and probe the dust and gas in the system
with unprecedented detail and sensitivity. The disk appears smooth down to the
4 au resolution of the 1.3 mm observations, in contrast with most disks
observed at comparable spatial scales. The dust disk has a radius of 60$\pm$5
au, a dust mass of $0.14_{-0.06}^{+0.11} M_{\rm Jup}$, and a mm spectral index
$<2$ in the inner 30 au, suggesting optically thick emission from grains with
high albedo in this region. Several molecular gas lines are also detected
extending up to 130$\pm$15 au, similar to small grains traced by scattered
light observations. Comparing the fluxes of different CO isotopologues with
previous models yields a gas mass of $0.1-1 M_{\rm Jup}$, implying a gas to
dust ratio of 1-10. We also measure a dynamical stellar mass of $M_{\rm
dyn}$=1.30$\pm$0.08 $M_\odot$ and derive an age of 7-10 Myr for the system. The
survival of large grains in an evolved disk without gaps/rings is surprising,
and it is possible that existing substructures remain undetected due to
optically thick emission at 1.3 mm. Alternatively, small structures may still
remain unresolved with the current observations. Based on simple scaling
relations for gap-opening planets and gap widths, this lack of substructures
places upper limits to the masses of planets in the disk as low as 2
$M_\oplus$-0.06 $M_{\rm Jup}$ at $r > 40$ au. The lack of mm emission at radii
$r > 60$ au also suggests that the gap in scattered light between 30-80 au is
likely not a gap in the disk density, but a shadow cast by a puffed-up inner
disk.

characterized by excess boundary charge and a compensating bulk ``filling

boundaries of two-dimensional HOTIs are gapped and featureless at low energies,
while the bulk of the system is predicted to have a topological response to the
insertion of lattice (particularly disclination) defects. Until recently, a
precise connection between these effects has remained elusive. In this work, we
point the direction towards a unifying field-theoretic description for the bulk

anomalies associated with bulk response to disclinations, allowing us to derive
a concrete connection between the bulk and boundary theories of HOTIs. We show

Monge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for
incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an
elliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear
partial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the
rate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to
understand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation
via the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold it defines in the cotangent bundle to
the configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher)
Monge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle
together with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The
signatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity
and rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a
physical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their
gradients. We show explicity, in the case of two-dimensional flows, how
topological information can be derived from the Monge-Ampere geometry of the
Lagrangian submanifold. We also demonstrate how certain solutions to the
three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as Hill's

kpc) through nine galaxy groups in this field. These can be compared with our
previous results in which these models can often be fit to the absorption
around isolated galaxies. Our models can reproduce $\approx$ 75$\%$ of the 28
identified absorption components within 500 km/s of a group galaxy, so most of
the H I around groups is consistent with a superposition of the CGM of the
individual galaxies. Gas stripped in interactions between galaxies may be a
plausible explanation for some of the remaining absorption, but neither the
galaxy images nor the galaxy and absorber kinematics provide clear evidence of
such stripped material, and these unexplained absorbers do not preferentially
occur around close pairs of galaxies. We find H I column densities typically
higher than at similar impact parameters around isolated galaxies ($\approx$
2.5$\sigma$), as well as more frequent detections of O VI than around isolated
galaxies (30$\%$ of sightlines to 7$\%$).

that drives the radial transport of chemical elements in regions of stellar
radiative zones where the mean molecular weight increases with radius. It is
often accounted for in one-dimensional stellar evolution calculations by using
simplified mixing prescriptions. Recently, Harrington & Garaud (2019) used
three-dimensional direct numerical simulations to show that a vertical magnetic
field can dramatically enhance the rate of chemical mixing by fingering
convection. Furthermore, they proposed a so-called ""parasitic saturation""
theory to model this process. Here, we test their model over a broad range of
parameter space, using a suite of direct numerical simulations of magnetized
fingering convection varying the magnetic Prandtl number, magnetic field
strength, and composition gradient. We find that the rate of chemical mixing is
not always predicted accurately by this existing model, in particular when the
magnetic diffusivity is large. We present a first attempt at extending the
Harrington & Garaud (2019) model to solve this issue, but are forced to
conclude that some of core assumptions of the parasitic saturation paradigm
must be revisited in the magnetized case.

good opportunity to study the physics happening in a transient period of time.
The development on the singly heavy baryons indicates that there exists the
fine structure of hadron spectrum caused by the direct strong interaction, and
the development on the exotic hadrons indicates that the residue strong
interaction is capable of forming the hadronic molecules. Similar to the
electromagnetic interaction, the strong interaction may be capable of forming
some imaginable hadronic worlds. Moreover, there can be various worlds formed
by various fundamental physical laws. Some hadrons have so transient lifetimes
that they may not even be formed. We discuss whether these non-existent
particles are capable of affecting our realistic world. We discuss what kinds
of particles exist, and so can be observed, in our realistic world. We
conjecture that the ratios $R \equiv M/\Gamma \gg 1/2$ ($M \tau \gg \hbar/2$)
and $R \equiv M/\Gamma < 1/2$ ($M \tau < \hbar/2$) can be used to describe the
particles existing and not-existing in our realistic world, respectively. Here
$M$, $\Gamma$, and $\tau$ are the mass, width, and lifetime, respectively. We
propose to use the ratio $R \equiv M/\Gamma \sim 1/2$ ($M \tau \sim \hbar/2$)
to describe the particles quasi-existing in our realistic world, whose studies
may allow us to go beyond the quantum physics and arrive at another type of
boundary of our realistic world, that is from the existent to the non-existent.
We propose to investigate the quasi-existent particles by studying the singly
heavy baryons through various imperfect symmetries among them. We obtain an
incidental conjecture that the lifetime and width may be quantized for the
particles existing in our realistic world as
\begin{equation*}M\tau=n\hbar/2~~~{\rm{and}}~~~M/\Gamma=n/2\,,~~~n=1,2,3\cdots\,.\end{equation*}

subgraphs or forbidden minors. These characterizations play a key role in graph
theory, but they rarely lead to efficient algorithms to recognize these
classes. In contrast, many essential graph classes can be recognized
efficiently thanks to characterizations of the following form: there must exist
an ordering of the vertices such that some ordered pattern does not appear,
where a pattern is basically an ordered subgraph. These pattern
characterizations have been studied for decades, but there have been recent
efforts to better understand them systematically. In this paper, we focus on a
simple problem at the core of this topic: given an ordered graph of size $n$,
how fast can we detect whether a fixed pattern of size $k$ is present?
  Following the literature on graph classes recognition, we first look for
patterns that can be detected in linear time. We prove, among other results,
that almost all patterns on three vertices (which capture many interesting
classes, such as interval, chordal, split, bipartite, and comparability graphs)
fall in this category. Then, in a finer-grained complexity perspective, we
prove conditional lower bounds for this problem. In particular we show that for
a large family of patterns on four vertices it is unlikely that subquadratic
algorithm exist. Finally, we define a parameter for patterns, the merge-width,
and prove that for patterns of merge-width $t$, one can solve the problem in
$O(n^{ct})$ for some constant~$c$. As a corollary, we get that detecting
outerplanar patterns and other classes of patterns can be done in time
independent of the size of the pattern.

Legendre and Chebyshev basis for the angular and radial sectors respectively,
using input from the asymptotic behavior of the perturbation at spatial
infinity and at the black hole event horizon. This spectral decomposition
allows us to then transform the linearized Einstein equations (a coupled set of
partial differential equations) into a linear matrix equation. By solving the
linear matrix equation for its generalized eigenvalues, we can estimate the
complex quasinormal frequencies of the fundamental mode and various overtones
of the gravitational perturbations simultaneously and to high accuracy. We
apply this technique to perturbations of a non-spinning, Schwarzschild black
hole in general relativity and find the complex quasinormal frequencies of 2
fundamental modes and their first 2 overtones. We demonstrate that the
technique is robust and accurate, in the Schwarzschild case leading to relative

Comments are welcome",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In realistic stabiliser-based quantum error correction there are many ways in
which real physical systems deviate from simple toy models of error. Stabiliser
measurements may not always be deterministic or may suffer from erasure errors,
such that they do not supply syndrome outcomes required for error correction.
In this paper, we study the performance of the toric code under a model of
probabilistic stabiliser measurement. We find that, even under a completely
continuous model of syndrome extraction, the threshold can be maintained at
reasonably high values of $1.69\%$ by suitably modifying the decoder using the
edge-contraction method of Stace and Barrett (Physical Review A 81, 022317
(2010)), compared to a value of $2.93\%$ for deterministic stabiliser
measurements. Finally, we study the role of entropic factors which account for
degenerate error configurations for improving on the performance of the
decoder. We find that in the limit of completely continuous stabiliser
measurement any advantage further provided by these factors becomes negligible
in contrast to the case of deterministic measurements.

However, it is often believed that standard GNNs only work well for homophilous
graphs, i.e., graphs where edges tend to connect nodes of the same class.
Graphs without this property are called heterophilous, and it is typically
assumed that specialized methods are required to achieve strong performance on
such graphs. In this work, we challenge this assumption. First, we show that
the standard datasets used for evaluating heterophily-specific models have
serious drawbacks, making results obtained by using them unreliable. The most
significant of these drawbacks is the presence of a large number of duplicate
nodes in the datsets Squirrel and Chameleon, which leads to train-test data
leakage. We show that removing duplicate nodes strongly affects GNN performance
on these datasets. Then, we propose a set of heterophilous graphs of varying

considerable fraction of the FRB energy budget is converted to an axion burst.
Once produced, the axion burst free-streams out of the magnetosphere due to the
rapidly-decreasing magnetic field. The burst may escape through either the open

FRB. In the wind region, axions resonantly excite ordinary (O) modes that
escape as the plasma density decreases. The radio efficiency of this mechanism
satisfies energetics constraints from FRB 121102 for axion-photon coupling
strengths that have not been excluded by other astrophysical probes.

exist. Our algorithm takes $\kappa^3\cdot \tilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ rounds, where
$n$ is the number of vertices in the network and $D$ denotes the network's
diameter. This implies $\tilde{O}(D+\sqrt{n})$ round complexity whenever
$\kappa=\text{polylog}(n)$.
  Prior to our result, a bound of $\tilde{O}(D)$ is known only when
$\kappa=1,2$ [Parter, Petruschka DISC'22]. For $\kappa\geq 3$, this bound can
be obtained only by an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm [Censor-Hillel,
Ghaffari, Kuhn PODC'14], and the only known exact algorithm takes
$O\left((\kappa\Delta D)^{O(\kappa)}\right)$ rounds, where $\Delta$ is the
maximum degree [Parter DISC'19]. Our result answers an open problem by
Nanongkai, Saranurak, and Yingchareonthawornchai [STOC'19].

  LOBs","16 pages, 1 figure, accepted for publication in FC'23",,,,"math.FA cs.GT math.OC q-fin.PM q-fin.TR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a general framework for the design and analysis of
exchange mechanisms between two assets that unifies and enables comparisons
between the two dominant paradigms for exchange, constant function market
markers (CFMMs) and limit order books (LOBs). In our framework, each liquidity
provider (LP) submits to the exchange a downward-sloping demand curve,
specifying the quantity of the risky asset it wishes to hold at each price; the
exchange buys and sells the risky asset so as to satisfy the aggregate
submitted demand. In general, such a mechanism is budget-balanced and enables
price discovery. Different exchange mechanisms correspond to different
restrictions on the set of acceptable demand curves. The primary goal of this
paper is to formalize an approximation-complexity trade-off that pervades the
design of exchange mechanisms. For example, CFMMs give up expressiveness in
favor of simplicity: the aggregate demand curve of the LPs can be described
using constant space, but most demand curves cannot be well approximated by any
function in the corresponding single-dimensional family. LOBs, intuitively,
make the opposite trade-off: any downward-slowing demand curve can be well
approximated by a collection of limit orders, but the space needed to describe
the state of a LOB can be large. This paper introduces a general measure of
{\em exchange complexity}, defined by the minimal set of basis functions that
generate, through their conical hull, all of the demand functions allowed by an
exchange. With this complexity measure in place, we investigate the design of
{\em optimally expressive} exchange mechanisms, meaning the lowest complexity
mechanisms that allow for arbitrary downward-sloping demand curves to be well
approximated. As a case study, we interpret the complexity-approximation
trade-offs in the widely-used Uniswap v3 AMM through the lens of our framework.

exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases mortality risk.
Furthermore, some population characteristics (e.g., age, race, and
socioeconomic status) might play a crucial role in understanding vulnerability
to air pollution. To inform policy, it is necessary to identify mutually
exclusive groups of the population that are more or less vulnerable to air
pollution. In the causal inference literature, the Conditional Average
Treatment Effect (CATE) is a commonly used metric designed to characterize the
heterogeneity of a treatment effect based on some population characteristics.
In this work, we introduce a novel modeling approach, called
Confounder-Dependent Bayesian Mixture Model (CDBMM), to characterize causal
effect heterogeneity. More specifically, our method leverages the flexibility
of the Dependent Dirichlet Process to model the distribution of the potential
outcomes conditionally to the covariates, thus enabling us to: (i) estimate
individual treatment effects, (ii) identify heterogeneous and mutually
exclusive population groups defined by similar CATEs, and (iii) estimate causal
effects within each of the identified groups. Through simulations, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in uncovering key insights about
treatment effects heterogeneity. We apply our method to claims data from
Medicare enrollees in Texas. We found seven mutually exclusive groups where the
causal effects of PM2.5 on mortality are heterogeneous.

reconstruction problem for the related distributions on the tree, and on the

  Both cases, reduce naturally to studying broadcasting models on the tree,
where each edge has its own broadcasting matrix, and this matrix is drawn
independently from a predefined distribution. In this context, we study the
effect of the configuration at the root to that of the vertices at distance
$h$, as $h\to\infty$.
  We establish the reconstruction threshold for the cases where the
broadcasting matrices give rise to symmetric, 2-spin Gibbs distributions. This
threshold seems to be a natural extension of the well-known Kesten-Stigum bound
which arises in the classic version of the reconstruction problem.
  Our results imply, as a special case, the reconstruction threshold for the
well-known Edward-Anderson model of spin-glasses on the tree.
  Also, we extend our analysis to the setting of the Galton-Watson tree, and
the random graph $G(n,d/n)$, where we establish the corresponding
thresholds.Interestingly, for the Edward-Anderson model on the random graph, we
show that the replica symmetry breaking phase transition, established in
[Guerra and Toninelli:2004], coincides with the reconstruction threshold.
  Compared to the classical Gibbs distributions, the spin-glasses have a lot of
unique features. In that respect, their study calls for new ideas, e.g., here
we introducing novel estimators for the reconstruction problem. Furthermore,
note that the main technical challenge in the analysis is the presence of (too)

in a symmetric, monotone manner, equilibrium always exists and is unique, and
provably-correct algorithms exist. We show that several of the most efficient
algorithms for the separable traffic assignment problem can be readily applied
with symmetric interactions. We discuss how the (asymmetric) Daganzo merge
model can be approximated by symmetric linear cost functions. Second, we
present computational evidence suggesting that convergence to equilibrium is
faster when symmetric, monotone link interactions are present. This is true
even when interactions are asymmetric, despite the lack of a provable
convergence result. Lastly, we present convergence behavior analysis for
commonly used network and link metrics. For these reasons, we think static
assignment with link interactions deserves additional attention in research and

comprehensive hydrodynamic/fluctuational driver of the kinematic equations of
motion. With this description, we show that the Langevin equations for a
Brownian particle interacting with a solvent fluid become particularly simple
and can be applied even in those cases in which the classical approach, based
on the concept of a stochastic thermal force, displays intrinsic difficulties
e.g., in the presence of the Basset force. We show that a convenient way for
describing hydrodynamic/thermal fluctuations is by expressing them in the form
of Extended Poisson-Kac Processes possessing prescribed correlation properties
and a continuous velocity density function. We further highlight the importance
of higher-order correlation functions in the description of the stochastic
hydrodynamic velocity field with special reference to short-time properties of
Brownian motion. We conclude by outlining some practical implications in

shown enormous potential in addressing these concerns: they can improve
predictive accuracy at a much lower observational data expense. Theoretically,
due to the risk posed by negative transfer, this improvement is however neither
uniform for all agents nor is it guaranteed. In this paper, using data from
several distributed energy resources, we investigate and report preliminary
findings on several key questions in this regard. First, we evaluate the
improvement in predictive accuracy due to pre-trained models, both with and

develop a finer grain understanding of what makes a code review comment useful
to OSS developers, to what extent a code review comment is considered useful to
them, and how various contextual and participant-related factors influence its
usefulness level. Method: On this goal, we have conducted a three-stage
mixed-method study. We randomly selected 2,500 CR comments from the OpenDev
Nova project and manually categorized the comments. We designed a survey of
OpenDev developers to better understand their perspectives on useful CRs.
Combining our survey-obtained scores with our manually labeled dataset, we
trained two regression models - one to identify factors that influence the
usefulness of CR comments and the other to identify factors that improve the
odds of `Functional' defect identification over the others. Key findings: The
results of our study suggest that a CR comment's usefulness is dictated not
only by its technical contributions such as defect findings or quality
improvement tips but also by its linguistic characteristics such as
comprehensibility and politeness. While a reviewer's coding experience
positively associates with CR usefulness, the number of mutual reviews, comment
volume in a file, the total number of lines added /modified, and CR interval
has the opposite associations. While authorship and reviewership experiences
for the files under review have been the most popular attributes for reviewer
recommendation systems, we do not find any significant association of those
attributes with CR usefulness.

The proposed approach generalizes the applicability of the conventional

function. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method over a linear
additive white Gaussian noise channel with intersymbol interference and two

achieve similar performance as a data aided equalizer using the \acf{MMSE}
criterion, and outperforms the blind\ac{CMA} and the \ac{VAE}-based channel
equalizer. Furthermore, we show that for the linear channel, the proposed
scheme exhibits better convergence properties than the \ac{MMSE}-based, the

conventional control approaches. We propose a novel, interpretable trajectory
tracker integrating a Distributional Reinforcement Learning disturbance
estimator for unknown aerodynamic effects with a Stochastic Model Predictive

Reinforced disturbance estimator' (ConsDRED) accurately identifies
uncertainties between true and estimated values of aerodynamic effects.
Simplified Affine Disturbance Feedback is used for control parameterization to
guarantee convexity, which we then integrate with a SMPC. We theoretically
guarantee that ConsDRED achieves at least an optimal global convergence rate
and a certain sublinear rate if constraints are violated with an error
decreases as the width and the layer of neural network increase. To demonstrate
practicality, we show convergent training in simulation and real-world
experiments, and empirically verify that ConsDRED is less sensitive to
hyperparameter settings compared with canonical constrained RL approaches. We
demonstrate our system improves accumulative tracking errors by at least 62%

ConsDRED-SMPC, balances the tradeoff between pursuing high performance and

the inclusion of nonradial modes, has been less well-examined. Making use of
new theoretical developments, we characterize glitches using the $\pi$ modes

Mobius-type boron-nitride nanobelts? To answer this question, we used the
semiempirical tight binding framework, as implemented in the xTB software, to
determine the lowest energy geometries, binding energy, complexes stability,
and electronic properties. Our calculations show that heavy metal nanoclusters
favorably bind to both boron-nitride nanobelts, although the interaction is
stronger with the Mobius-type nanobelt. The calculations show that the nickel
nanocluster has the lowest binding energy and the greatest charge transfer with
the nanobelts, followed by the cadmium and lead nanoclusters. During the
simulation time, the molecular dynamic simulation showed that all complexes
were stable at 298 K. Following the nanobelt's symmetry, the frontier orbitals
are distributed homogeneously throughout the structure. This distribution
changed when the nanobelt was twisted to create the Mobius-type nanobelt. The
topological study indicated that the number of bonds between the metal
nanoclusters and the Mobius-type nanobelt doubled and that the bonds formed
with the nickel nanocluster were stronger than those formed with the cadmium
and lead metals. Combining all the results, we conclude that the nickel
nanoclusters are chemisorbed, whereas the cadmium and lead nanoclusters are
physisorbed in both nanobelts.

geoelectric field dynamic mapping output gives both spatial and temporal

lotteries and two-part tariffs. A menu of lotteries is a list of entries where
each entry is a pair consisting of probabilities of allocating each item and a
price. Menus of lotteries is an especially important family of randomized
mechanisms that are known to achieve revenue beyond any deterministic
mechanism. A menu of two-part tariffs, on the other hand, is a pricing scheme
(that consists of an up-front fee and a per unit fee) that is commonly used in
the real world, e.g., for car or bike sharing services.
  We study learning high-revenue menus of lotteries and two-part tariffs from
buyer valuation data in both distributional settings, where we have access to
buyers' valuation samples up-front, and online settings, where buyers arrive
one at a time and no distributional assumption is made about their values. Our
main contribution is proposing the first online learning algorithms for menus
of lotteries and two-part tariffs with strong regret bound guarantees.
Furthermore, we provide algorithms with improved running times over prior work
for the distributional settings.
  The key difficulty when deriving learning algorithms for these settings is
that the relevant revenue functions have sharp transition boundaries. In stark
contrast with the recent literature on learning such unstructured functions, we
show that simple discretization-based techniques are sufficient for learning in
these settings.

transforms images from one domain to images in another domain so that they have
particular domain-specific characteristics. Most prior works train a generative
model to learn the mapping from a source domain to a target domain. However,
learning such mapping between domains is challenging because data from
different domains can be highly unbalanced in terms of both quality and
quantity. To address this problem, we propose a new approach to extract image
features by learning the similarities and differences of samples within the
same data distribution via a novel contrastive learning framework, which we
call Auto-Contrastive-Encoder (ACE). ACE learns the content code as the
similarity between samples with the same content information and different
style perturbations. The design of ACE enables us to achieve zero-shot
image-to-image translation with no training on image translation tasks for the
first time.
  Moreover, our learning method can learn the style features of images on
different domains effectively. Consequently, our model achieves competitive
results on multimodal image translation tasks with zero-shot learning as well.
Additionally, we demonstrate the potential of our method in transfer learning.
With fine-tuning, the quality of translated images improves in unseen domains.
Even though we use contrastive learning, all of our training can be performed
on a single GPU with the batch size of 8.

excess risk in $O(d_{\pi}/n)$, as opposed to the standard
$O(\sqrt{d_{\pi}/n})$, where $n$ denotes the number of observations and
$d_{\pi}$ is a complexity parameter which depends on the prior $\pi$. In this
paper, we examine the Gibbs algorithm in the context of meta-learning, i.e.,
when learning the prior $\pi$ from $T$ tasks (with $n$ observations each)
generated by a meta distribution. Our main result is that Bernstein's condition
always holds at the meta level, regardless of its validity at the observation
level. This implies that the additional cost to learn the Gibbs prior $\pi$,
which will reduce the term $d_\pi$ across tasks, is in $O(1/T)$, instead of the
expected $O(1/\sqrt{T})$. We further illustrate how this result improves on
standard rates in three different settings: discrete priors, Gaussian priors

  Identification","13 pages body, 16 pages total, 7 figures body, 11 figures total",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Accurate and efficient network traffic classification is important for many
network management tasks, from traffic prioritization to anomaly detection.
Although classifiers using pre-computed flow statistics (e.g., packet sizes,
inter-arrival times) can be efficient, they may experience lower accuracy than
techniques based on raw traffic, including packet captures. Past work on
representation learning-based classifiers applied to network traffic captures
has shown to be more accurate, but slower and requiring considerable additional
memory resources, due to the substantial costs in feature preprocessing. In
this paper, we explore this trade-off and develop the Adaptive
Constraint-Driven Classification (AC-DC) framework to efficiently curate a pool
of classifiers with different target requirements, aiming to provide comparable
classification performance to complex packet-capture classifiers while adapting
to varying network traffic load.
  AC-DC uses an adaptive scheduler that tracks current system memory
availability and incoming traffic rates to determine the optimal classifier and
batch size to maximize classification performance given memory and processing
constraints. Our evaluation shows that AC-DC improves classification
performance by more than 100% compared to classifiers that rely on flow
statistics alone; compared to the state-of-the-art packet-capture classifiers,
AC-DC achieves comparable performance (less than 12.3% lower in F1-Score), but
processes traffic over 150x faster.

model predictive control that simulates thousands of trajectories and uses
these trajectories to synthesize optimal controls on-the-fly. In practice,
however, MPPI encounters problems limiting its application. For instance, it
has been observed that MPPI tends to make poor decisions if unmodeled dynamics
or environmental disturbances exist, preventing its use in safety-critical
applications. Moreover, the multi-threaded simulations used by MPPI require
significant onboard computational resources, making the algorithm inaccessible
to robots without modern GPUs. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel
(Shield-MPPI) algorithm that provides robustness against unpredicted
disturbances and achieves real-time planning using a much smaller number of
parallel simulations on regular CPUs. The novel Shield-MPPI algorithm is tested
on an aggressive autonomous racing platform both in simulation and using

incompatible codewords from a list of candidate codewords, and can be improved

solid was postulated decades ago, before being experimentally established in
several 'polar metals' during the last decade. Here,we establish the existence
of concentration driven polar to non-polar phase transition in electron doped
BaTiO3. Comparing our case with other polar metals, we find a particular
threshold concentration (n*), proportional to the dipole density (n_d), for the
termination of polar phase. The universal ratio n_d/n*=8(0.6) indicates a
common mechanism in different polar systems and put stringent constraints on
relevant theories. We argue that this polar threshold could be accounted for by
an anti-polar interaction between neighboring dipoles through a dipolar
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida theory. Moreover, in the case of BaTiO3, we find
an enhancement in thermopower and upturn on resistivity at low temperatures in
the vicinity of n*. Both these features point to a dipolar-Kondo effect, where
dipole fluctuations couple to the surrounding electron clouds. Our findings
unveil a mostly unexplored territory for the exploration of emerging physics
associated with correlations between electrons and electric dipoles.

Potential customers arrive according to a Poisson process and purchase the
service if their valuation exceeds the current price. If no units are
available, customers immediately leave without service. Serving a customer
corresponds to using one unit of the reusable resource, where the service time
has an exponential distribution. The objective is to maximize the steady-state
revenue rate. This system is equivalent to the classical Erlang loss model with
price-sensitive customers, which has applications in vehicle sharing, cloud
computing, and spare parts management.
  Although an optimal pricing policy is dynamic, we provide two main results
that show a simple static policy is universally near-optimal for any service
rate, arrival rate, and number of units in the system. When there is one class
of customers who have a monotone hazard rate (MHR) valuation distribution, we
prove that a static pricing policy guarantees 90.4\% of the revenue from the
optimal dynamic policy. When there are multiple classes of customers that each
have their own regular valuation distribution and service rate, we prove that
static pricing guarantees 78.9\% of the revenue of the optimal dynamic policy.
In this case, the optimal pricing policy is exponentially large in the number
of classes while the static policy requires only one price per class. Moreover,
we prove that the optimal static policy can be easily computed, resulting in
the first polynomial time approximation algorithm for this problem.

$\langle \sigma\cdot x\rangle ^{r}u(t)\in L^2\left(\left\{\sigma\cdot

extend such results to arbitrary dimensions, decay power $r>0$ not necessarily
an integer, and we give a detailed description of the gain of regularity
propagated by solutions in terms of the magnitude of the weight $r$. The
deduction of our results depends on a new class of pseudo-differential
operators, which is useful to quantify decay and smoothness properties on a
fractional scale. Secondly, we show that if the initial data $u_{0}$ has a
decay of exponential type on a particular half space, that is, $e^{b\,

this is the first study of such property. As a further consequence, we also
obtain well-posedness results in anisotropic weighted Sobolev spaces in
arbitrary dimensions.
  Finally, as a by-product of the techniques considered here, we show that our

quantitative investigation of the development of writhe during its eruption is
still lacking. Here we introduce the Writhe Application Toolkit (WAT) which can
be used to characterize accurately the topology of filament axes. This
characterization is achieved based on the reconstruction and writhe number
computation of three-dimensional paths of the filament axes from
dual-perspective observations. We apply this toolkit to four dextral filaments
located in the northern hemisphere with a counterclockwise (CCW) rotation
during their eruptions. Initially, all these filaments possess a small writhe
number (=<0.20) indicating a weak helical deformation of the axes. As the CCW
rotation kicks in, their writhe numbers begin to decrease and reach large
negative values. Combined with the extended C\u{a}lug\u{a}reanu theorem, the
absolute value of twist is deduced to decrease during the rotation. Such a

open in the multiplane setting. We construct examples of $K$-plane point-mass
gravitational lens ensembles that produce $\prod_{i=1}^K (5g_i-5)$ images of a

$t \rightarrow H^{\pm}b$, is presented. The search targets $H^{\pm}$ decays
into a bottom and a charm quark, $H^{\pm} \rightarrow cb$. The analysis focuses
on a selection enriched in top-quark pair production, where one top quark
decays into a leptonically decaying $W$ boson and a bottom quark, and the other
top quark decays into a charged Higgs boson and a bottom quark. This topology
leads to a lepton-plus-jets final state, characterised by an isolated electron
or muon and at least four jets. The search exploits the high multiplicity of
jets containing $b$-hadrons, and deploys a neural network classifier that uses
the kinematic differences between the signal and the background. The search
uses a dataset of proton-proton collisions collected at a centre-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV between 2015 and 2018 with the ATLAS detector at CERN's Large
Hadron Collider, amounting to an integrated luminosity of 139~fb$^{-1}$.
Observed (expected) 95\% confidence-level upper limits between 0.15\% (0.09\%)
and 0.42\% (0.25\%) are derived for the product of branching fractions
$\mathscr{B}(t\rightarrow H^{\pm}b) \times \mathscr{B}(H^{\pm}\rightarrow cb)$
for charged Higgs boson masses between 60 and 160~GeV, assuming the SM
production of the top-quark pairs.

strategies for localizing a target mobile device in emergency situations. The
global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based accurate position information
of a target mobile device in an emergency may not be always available to first
responders. For example, 1) GNSS positioning accuracy may be degraded in harsh
signal environments and 2) in countries where emergency positioning service is
not mandatory, some mobile devices may not report their locations. Under the
cases mentioned above, one way to find the target mobile device is to use UAVs.
Dispatched UAVs may search the target directly on the emergency site by
measuring the strength of the signal (e.g., LTE wireless communication signal)
from the target mobile device. To accurately localize the target mobile device
in the shortest time possible, UAVs should fly in the most efficient way
possible. The two popular trajectory optimization strategies of UAVs are greedy
and predictive approaches. However, the research on localization performances
of the two approaches has been evaluated only under favorable settings (i.e.,
under good UAV geometries and small received signal strength (RSS) errors);
more realistic scenarios still remain unexplored. In this study, we compare the
localization performance of the greedy and predictive approaches under
realistic RSS errors (i.e., up to 6 dB according to the ITU-R channel model).

would (i) increase the resilience of the customers in case the utility grid
becomes unavailable, (ii) reduce AC/DC conversion losses since a majority of
the DER generation is in DC, and (iii) with the help of BESS, the customers
will have a lesser impact on the utility grid in terms of California 'duck
curve.' The exchange of resources and further utilization of economies of scale
would significantly reduce the cost of this new infrastructure. Customers will
be able to fall back on the utility AC grid in case of a cyber-attack on the
community DC grid, improving cyber-security further. The proposed P2P
transactive energy scheme is based on cooperation among the homeowners, using
additional metering nodes to allow the sale or purchase of energy among
residents. While it is expected that the scope will be limited to customers
within a neighborhood, multiple neighborhoods can still interact via a utility
AC grid. While it is likely that the P2P controller carrying out optimal
control would work seamlessly, customers' interactions will be based on a
zero-trust approach. As a part of this approach, multifactor authentication,
role-based access control, etc., would be utilized, significantly improving
overall cybersecurity. We examine these three strategies as case studies: (i)
single home with solar power, (ii) single home with Solar power and BESS, and
(iii) two or more homes with solar power and community energy storage to
facilitate the policymakers making the recommendation.

in Poisson statistics. We studied the difference between Poisson-based and

Poisson-based search method has advantages compared to the Gaussian case
especially for weak bursts. Our results show that, for very weak bursts with
very low number of counts, the Poisson-based search can provide higher
significance than the Gaussian-based search, and its likelihood ratio (for

the significance estimation of searched bursts very convenient. Thus, we
suggest that the coherent search based on Poisson likelihood ratio is more
appropriate in the search for generic transients including very weak ones.

system for studying the adaptive sensing of environmental signals by large
protein complexes. The chemoreceptors control the kinase activity of CheA in
response to the extracellular ligand concentration and adapt across a wide
concentration range by undergoing methylation and demethylation. Methylation
shifts the kinase response curve by orders of magnitude in ligand concentration
while incurring a much smaller change in the ligand binding curve. Here, we
show that this asymmetric shift in binding and kinase response is inconsistent
with equilibrium allosteric models regardless of parameter choices. To resolve
this inconsistency, we present a nonequilibrium allosteric model that
explicitly includes the dissipative reaction cycles driven by ATP hydrolysis.
The model successfully explains all existing measurements for both aspartate
and serine receptors. Our results suggest that while ligand binding controls
the equilibrium balance between the ON and OFF states of the kinase, receptor
methylation modulates the kinetic properties (e.g., the phosphorylation rate)
of the ON state. Furthermore, sufficient energy dissipation is necessary for
maintaining and enhancing the sensitivity range and amplitude of the kinase
response. We demonstrate that the nonequilibrium allosteric model is broadly
applicable to other sensor-kinase systems by successfully fitting previously
unexplained data from the DosP bacterial oxygen-sensing system. Overall, this
work provides a new perspective on cooperative sensing by large protein
complexes and opens up new research directions for understanding their

utilized to test for eavesdropping, and even when the eavesdropper can
completely control the outcomes of two participants' measurements, our scheme
still ensures the security of the keys distribution. This scheme can be easily
extended to the case of $N$-party keys distribution, and the violation of
$N$-partite Svetlichny's inequality guarantees the security of the generalized
scheme. Since the GHZ state has maximum entanglement, its perfect monogamy
guarantee the device-independent security of our protocol. However quantum
entanglement is a vulnerable resource which is often decayed during
transmission, so we need here to derive the secret-key rate of our protocol
under the condition of using quantum states with non-maximal entanglement. We
then calculate the extractable secret-key rate of the three-party key
distribution protocol for the Werner state in the device-independent scenario.
We find that the value of the extractable secret-key rate monotonously
approaches $1$ as the value of the visibility of the Werner state increases,

electro-thermal bridge measurement method is established to enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the measurement uncertainty by about 40%. The
obtained thermal resistances of multiple suspended segments of the same MWCNT
samples increase nearly linearly with increasing length, revealing diffusive
phonon transport as a result of phonon-defect scattering in these MWCNT
samples. The measured thermal conductivity increases with temperature and
reaches up to 410 +- 10 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature for a 7-walled MWCNT and
390 +- 20 W m-1 K-1 at room temperature for another 9-walled MWCNT. The
obtained thermal conductivity is decreased by a factor of three by
organometallic nanoparticles that are deposited on the CNT surface and scatter
phonons in the CNT.

discovered in the corona, during total solar eclipses, and they continue to
offer unique opportunities to study the physical properties of the corona. The
most commonly observed coronal emission lines today are in the extreme
ultraviolet, which are dominated by collisionally excited emission. V+NIR lines
on the other hand, are radiatively excited out to high helioprojective
distances. Indeed, recent eclipse observations have demonstrated the diagnostic
potential of V+NIR lines, which are still observable out to at least 3.4 Rs.
V+NIR lines can be used to infer key plasma parameters such as: the electron
and ion temperatures, magnetic field strength and morphologies, the ionic
freeze-in distances, Doppler motions of coronal plasmas, and the dynamics of
coronal mass ejections through time variations of these parameters. Current and
planned space-based coronagraphs, such as Solar Orbiter and Proba 3, will have
some filters for V+NIR lines, but will only have an exceptionally small
selection. They will thus be limited in their ability to infer electron or ion
temperatures, as well as other crucial physical properties of the corona. The
ground-based DKIST and UCoMP will soon offer V+NIR line observations, but they
will be limited to a maximum helioprojective distance of about 1.5 Rs. To
better explore the middle corona, and to understand the formation of the solar
wind and space weather events, it is essential that we deploy additional
space-based assets to measure a wide selection of V+NIR emission lines at
helioprojective distances beyond 1.5 Rs. Occulting of the solar disk could be
achieved by a conventional coronagraph, by novel methods such as an external
occulter, by lunar occultations in situ in orbit around the Moon, or by lunar
based observations of lunar eclipses (i.e., total solar eclipse on the Moon).

emission lines can thus yield the only inferences of the physical properties of
the coronal plasma, such as species temperatures, densities, elemental

critical spatial span. These diagnostics have been demonstrated with decades of
unsurpassed high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations during total
solar eclipses. This white paper calls for dedicated funding for a Total Solar
Eclipse Earth-Based Mission for ground, airborne and seaborne observations of
the corona during totality for the next decade starting in 2024. The proposed
Mission capitalizes on the unique diagnostic potential offered by the V+NIR
coronal emission lines for the inference of key plasma parameters over a
distance range of at least 5 Rs from the solar surface. This critical coronal

instrumentation in the proposed time frame. Multi-site observing platforms for
each eclipse would further capture the temporal variability of coronal plasmas
over a time span of at least 1 hour, with a temporal resolution of a fraction

framework of quantum causal models, by generalising the three-step procedure of
abduction, action, and prediction in Pearl's classical formalism of
counterfactuals. To this end, we define a suitable extension of Pearl's notion
of a ""classical structural causal model"", which we denote analogously by
""quantum structural causal model"". We show that every classical (probabilistic)
structural causal model can be extended to a quantum structural causal model,
and prove that counterfactual queries that can be formulated within a classical
structural causal model agree with their corresponding queries in the quantum
extension - but the latter is more expressive. Counterfactuals in quantum
causal models come in different forms: we distinguish between active and
passive counterfactual queries, depending on whether or not an intervention is
to be performed in the action step. This is in contrast to the classical case,
where counterfactuals are always interpreted in the active sense. As a
consequence of this distinction, we observe that quantum causal models break
the connection between causal and counterfactual dependence that exists in the
classical case: (passive) quantum counterfactuals allow counterfactual
dependence without causal dependence. This illuminates an important distinction
between classical and quantum causal models, which underlies the fact that the
latter can reproduce quantum correlations that violate Bell inequalities while
being faithful to the relativistic causal structure.

of the input image. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), have been extremely successful in achieving excellent performances in
this domain. However, mobile application, such as autonomous driving, demand
real-time processing of incoming stream of images. Hence, achieving efficient
architectures along with enhanced accuracy is of paramount importance. Since,
accuracy and model size of CNNs are intrinsically contentious in nature, the
challenge is to achieve a decent trade-off between accuracy and model size. To
address this, we propose a novel Factorized Pyramidal Learning (FPL) module to
aggregate rich contextual information in an efficient manner. On one hand, it
uses a bank of convolutional filters with multiple dilation rates which leads
to multi-scale context aggregation; crucial in achieving better accuracy. On
the other hand, parameters are reduced by a careful factorization of the
employed filters; crucial in achieving lightweight models. Moreover, we
decompose the spatial pyramid into two stages which enables a simple and
efficient feature fusion within the module to solve the notorious checkerboard
effect. We also design a dedicated Feature-Image Reinforcement (FIR) unit to
carry out the fusion operation of shallow and deep features with the
downsampled versions of the input image. This gives an accuracy enhancement
without increasing model parameters. Based on the FPL module and FIR unit, we
propose an ultra-lightweight real-time network, called FPLNet, which achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-off. More specifically, with only
less than 0.5 million parameters, the proposed network achieves 66.93\% and

work in discrete action spaces, discrete gradient estimation must be performed.
For MADDPG, the Gumbel-Softmax (GS) estimator is used -- a reparameterisation

suggests that this bias makes MADDPG perform poorly in grid-world situations,

exist, boasting a wide range of properties. This paper explores several of

  Answering","Accepted in AAAI 2023, oral",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Knowledge-aware question answering (KAQA) requires the model to answer
questions over a knowledge base, which is essential for both open-domain QA and
domain-specific QA, especially when language models alone cannot provide all
the knowledge needed. Despite the promising result of recent KAQA systems which
tend to integrate linguistic knowledge from pre-trained language models (PLM)
and factual knowledge from knowledge graphs (KG) to answer complex questions, a
bottleneck exists in effectively fusing the representations from PLMs and KGs
because of (i) the semantic and distributional gaps between them, and (ii) the
difficulties in joint reasoning over the provided knowledge from both
modalities. To address the above two problems, we propose a Fine-grained
Two-stage training framework (FiTs) to boost the KAQA system performance: The
first stage aims at aligning representations from the PLM and the KG, thus
bridging the modality gaps between them, named knowledge adaptive
post-training. The second stage, called knowledge-aware fine-tuning, aims to
improve the model's joint reasoning ability based on the aligned
representations. In detail, we fine-tune the post-trained model via two
auxiliary self-supervised tasks in addition to the QA supervision. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA,
OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMILE) domains.

these systems is fully characterized by their transition probabilities.
However, computing them requires marginalizing over all paths between

Leveraging recent results that connect generating function methods to a
compressed sensing framework, we recast this task from the lens of sparse
optimization. We propose a new solution method using variable splitting; in
particular, we derive closed form updates in a highly efficient ADMM algorithm.
Notably, no matrix products -- let alone inversions -- are required at any
step. This reduces computational cost by orders of magnitude over existing
methods, and the resulting algorithm is easily parallelizable and fairly
insensitive to tuning parameters. A comparison to prior work is carried out in
two applications to models of blood cell production and transposon evolution,
showing that the proposed method is orders of magnitudes more scalable than

explains the existence of mean magnetic fields by invoking the `incoherent
$\alpha$ effect', which appeals to fluctuations of the mean kinetic helicity.
Previous studies, while considering fluctuations in the mean kinetic helicity,
treated the mean turbulent kinetic energy as a constant, despite the fact that
both these quantities involve second-order velocity correlations. The mean
turbulent kinetic energy causes both turbulent diffusion and diamagnetic
pumping of the mean magnetic field. In this work, we use a double-averaging
procedure to analytically show that fluctuations of the mean turbulent kinetic
energy (giving rise to $\eta$-fluctuations, where $\eta$ is the turbulent
diffusivity) can lead to the growth of a large-scale magnetic field even when
the kinetic helicity is zero pointwise. Constraints on the operation of such a
dynamo are expressed in terms of dynamo numbers that depend on the correlation
length, correlation time, and strength of these fluctuations. In the
white-noise limit, we find that these fluctuations reduce the overall turbulent
diffusion, while also contributing a drift term which does not affect the
growth of the field. We also study the effects of nonzero correlation time and
anisotropy. Diamagnetic pumping, which arises due to inhomogeneities in the
turbulent kinetic energy, leads to growing mean field solutions even when the
$\eta$-fluctuations are isotropic. Our results suggest that fluctuations of the
turbulent kinetic energy may be relevant in astrophysical contexts.

the implementation cost and energy consumption. However, aggressive
quantization below 2-bit causes considerable accuracy degradation due to
unstable convergence, especially when the downstream dataset is not abundant.
This work proposes a proactive knowledge distillation method called Teacher
Intervention (TI) for fast converging QAT of ultra-low precision pre-trained

signal from the teacher to remove the interference of propagated quantization
errors, smoothing loss surface of QAT and expediting the convergence.
Furthermore, we propose a gradual intervention mechanism to stabilize the
recovery of subsections of Transformer layers from quantization. The proposed
schemes enable fast convergence of QAT and improve the model accuracy
regardless of the diverse characteristics of downstream fine-tuning tasks. We
demonstrate that TI consistently achieves superior accuracy with significantly
lower fine-tuning iterations on well-known Transformers of natural language

of turbulence and leads to turbulence modulation. Different temporal and
spatial scales for both phases make it challenging to understand turbulence
modulation via one parameter. The important parameters are particle Stokes
number, mass loading, particle Reynolds number, fluid bulk Reynolds number,
etc., that act together and affect the fluid phase turbulence intensities. In
the present study, we have carried out the large eddy simulations for different
system sizes (2{\delta}/dp = 54, 81, and 117) and fluid bulk Reynolds numbers
(Re_b = 5600 and 13750) to quantify the extent of turbulence attenuation. Here,
{\delta} is the half-channel width, dp is the particle diameter, and Re_b is
the fluid Reynolds number based on the fluid bulk velocity and channel width.
The point particles are tracked with the Lagrangian approach. The scaling
analysis of the feedback force shows that system size and fluid bulk Reynolds
number are the two crucial parameters that affect the turbulence modulation
more significantly than the other. The streamwise turbulent structures are
observed to become lengthier and fewer with an increase in system size for the
same volume fraction and fixed bulk Reynolds number. However, the streamwise
high-speed streaks are smaller, thinner, and closely spaced for higher Reynolds
numbers than the lower ones for the same volume fraction. In particle
statistics, it is observed that the scaled particle fluctuations increase with
the increase in system size while keeping the Reynolds number fixed. However,
the scaled particle fluctuations decrease with the increase in fluid bulk
Reynolds number for the same volume fraction and fixed system size. The present
study highlights the scaling issue for designing industrial equipment for
particle-laden turbulent flows.

dual-path Transformer models is the inefficient modelling of long-range
elemental interactions and local feature patterns. In this work, we achieve the
upper bound by proposing a gated single-head transformer architecture with
convolution-augmented joint self-attentions, named \textit{MossFormer}
(\textit{Mo}naural \textit{s}peech \textit{s}eparation Trans\textit{Former}).
To effectively solve the indirect elemental interactions across chunks in the
dual-path architecture, MossFormer employs a joint local and global
self-attention architecture that simultaneously performs a full-computation
self-attention on local chunks and a linearised low-cost self-attention over
the full sequence. The joint attention enables MossFormer model full-sequence
elemental interaction directly. In addition, we employ a powerful attentive
gating mechanism with simplified single-head self-attentions. Besides the
attentive long-range modelling, we also augment MossFormer with convolutions
for the position-wise local pattern modelling. As a consequence, MossFormer
significantly outperforms the previous models and achieves the state-of-the-art

elliptic partial differential equations without mesh generation or global

estimates solution values and derivatives at randomly sampled points along the
boundary of the domain (or a local region of interest). These cached values
then provide cheap, output-sensitive evaluation of the solution (or its
gradient) at interior points, via a boundary integral formulation. Unlike
classic boundary integral methods, our caching scheme introduces zero
statistical bias and does not require a dense global solve. Moreover we can
handle imperfect geometry (e.g., with self-intersections) and detailed
boundary/source terms without repairing or resampling the boundary
representation. Overall, our scheme is similar in spirit to virtual point light
methods from photorealistic rendering: it suppresses the typical
salt-and-pepper noise characteristic of independent Monte Carlo estimates,
while still retaining the many advantages of Monte Carlo solvers: progressive
evaluation, trivial parallelization, geometric robustness, etc. We validate our

Fourier transform into a cascaded network. Our approach is motivated by a few
unique characteristics in the Fourier domain: 1) most luminance information
concentrates on amplitudes while noise is closely related to phases, and 2) a
high-resolution image and its low-resolution version share similar amplitude
patterns.Through embedding Fourier into our network, the amplitude and phase of
a low-light image are separately processed to avoid amplifying noise when
enhancing luminance. Besides, UHDFour is scalable to UHD images by implementing
amplitude and phase enhancement under the low-resolution regime and then
adjusting the high-resolution scale with few computations. We also contribute
the first real UHD LLIE dataset, \textbf{UHD-LL}, that contains 2,150

extend the conformer network into the complex domain and form a dual-path

distributions as its marginals. This has immediate relevance to tasks such as
entropic causal inference for causal graph discovery and bounding mutual
information between variables that we observe separately. Since finding the
minimum entropy coupling is NP-Hard, various works have studied approximation
algorithms. The work of [Compton, ISIT 2022] shows that the greedy coupling
algorithm of [Kocaoglu et al., AAAI 2017] is always within $log_2(e) \approx
1.44$ bits of the optimal coupling. Moreover, they show that it is impossible
to obtain a better approximation guarantee using the majorization lower-bound
that all prior works have used: thus establishing a majorization barrier. In
this work, we break the majorization barrier by designing a stronger
lower-bound that we call the profile method. Using this profile method, we are
able to show that the greedy algorithm is always within $log_2(e)/e \approx
0.53$ bits of optimal for coupling two distributions (previous best-known bound

some assumptions on the decay rate of $V$ and the corresponding range of $p$,
we prove that the problem has a family of solutions $\{u_\varepsilon\}$
concentrating at a local minimum of $V$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$. Since the
potential $V$ decays at infinity, we need to employ a type of penalized
argument and implement delicate analysis on the both nonlocal terms to
establish regularity, positivity and asymptotic behaviour of $u_\varepsilon$,
which is totally different from the local case. As a contrast, we also develop
some nonexistence results, which imply that the assumptions on $V$ and $p$ for
the existence of $u_\varepsilon$ are almost optimal. To prove our main results,
a general strong maximum principle and comparison function for the weak
solutions of fractional Laplacian equations are established. The main methods
in this paper are variational methods, penalized technique and some comparison

vary in different coronal structures. Here, we use the soft X-ray spectroscopic
measurements from the Solar X-ray Monitor (XSM) on board the Chandrayaan-2
orbiter to study the FIP effect in multiple A-class flares observed during the
minimum of solar cycle 24. Using time-integrated spectral analysis, we derive
the average temperature, emission measure, and the abundances of four elements
- Mg, Al, Si, and S. We find that the temperature and emission measure scales
with the flares sub-class while the measured abundances show an intermediate
FIP bias for the lower A-flares (e.g., A1), while for the higher A-flares, the
FIP bias is near unity. To investigate it further, we perform a time-resolved
spectral analysis for a sample of the A-class flares and examine the evolution
of temperature, emission measure, and abundances. We find that the abundances
drop from the coronal values towards their photospheric values in the impulsive
phase of the flares, and after the impulsive phase, they quickly return to the
usual coronal values. The transition of the abundances from the coronal to
photospheric values in the impulsive phase of the flares indicates the
injection of fresh unfractionated material from the lower solar atmosphere to
the corona due to chromospheric evaporation. However, explaining the quick
recovery of the abundances from the photospheric to coronal values in the decay

direct-detection (IM-DD) fiber-optic channels is theoretically investigated.
Different from coherent fiber-optic channels, we indicate that the
capacity-achieving distribution of IM-DD systems should be discussed separately
in two cases: 1) IM-DD systems without optical amplifier, which are constrained
in peak power; 2) IM-DD systems with optical amplifier, which are the average
power constraint (APC) system. For the two models, the maximum mutual
information achieving distribution, instead of the maximum input entropy
achieving distribution, is numerically computed by the iterative Blahut-Arimoto
(BA) algorithm. For the IM-DD system under peak power constraint (PPC), a
dynamic-assignment BA algorithm is applied to find the capacity-achieving
distribution with minimum cardinality. It is observed that the maximum
difference between the minimum input cardinality and capacity is around 0.8
bits. For a fixed support input cardinality, although the observed shaping gain
is small and only appears in low peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) regions in
the PPC IM-DD system, the probabilistic shaping technique can also be used to
introduce rate adaptation to the system by adjusting the shaping and FEC
overheads since the capacity-achieving distribution is symmetric. In the IM-DD
system under APC, a modified BA algorithm is investigated to solve for the
capacity and capacity-achieving distribution, and a significant shaping gain is
observed. For PAM8 and PAM16 modulation formats, 0.294 bits/symbol and 0.531
bits/symbol shaping gain can be obtained at the SNR of 20dB. Furthermore, since
the capacity-achieving distribution is asymmetric in this case, a practical
discussion of the PS technique is also presented.

$\mathrm{fun}(G) \le \mathrm{sd}(G)+1$ for every graph $G$. We compare
$\mathrm{fun}$ and $\mathrm{sd}$ for the class $\mathrm{INT}$ of interval

formulations are presented. Special attention is paid to the four corner terms

variational problem. From a detailed analysis of the gravity boundary condition
on the spatial boundary, we find that while the lapse and the shift functions
are independent Lagrange multipliers on the bulk, on the spatial boundary,
these two are related. This fact leads to an algebraic equation of motion for a
particular degree of freedom that is conveniently introduced on the spatial
boundaries whose solution can be plugged back into the action allowing to fully
determine the time dependent transition amplitude. The final result suggests
that the time evolution could be non-unitary. Other wave functions for other

cost of traditional simulators. Yet, the resulting predictors are confined to
learning from data generated by existing mesh-based simulators and thus cannot
include real world sensory information such as point cloud data. As these
predictors have to simulate complex physical systems from only an initial
state, they exhibit a high error accumulation for long-term predictions. In
this work, we integrate sensory information to ground Graph Network Simulators
on real world observations. In particular, we predict the mesh state of
deformable objects by utilizing point cloud data. The resulting model allows
for accurate predictions over longer time horizons, even under uncertainties in
the simulation, such as unknown material properties. Since point clouds are
usually not available for every time step, especially in online settings, we
employ an imputation-based model. The model can make use of such additional

method results in utilization of additional point cloud information to
accurately predict stable simulations where existing Graph Network Simulators

move massive amounts of illegal money to untraceable destinations and integrate
them into legitimate financial systems. It is very crucial to identify such
activities accurately and reliably in order to enforce an anti-money laundering
(AML). Despite tremendous efforts to AML only a tiny fraction of illicit
activities are prevented. From a given graph of money transfers between
accounts of a bank, existing approaches attempted to detect money laundering.
In particular, some approaches employ structural and behavioural dynamics of
dense subgraph detection thereby not taking into consideration that money
laundering involves high-volume flows of funds through chains of bank accounts.
Some approaches model the transactions in the form of multipartite graphs to
detect the complete flow of money from source to destination. However, existing
approaches yield lower detection accuracy, making them less reliable. In this
paper, we employ semi-supervised graph learning techniques on graphs of
financial transactions in order to identify nodes involved in potential money

  Linear Networks: A Generic Analysis","17 pages, 4 figures; fix some typos",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Temporal networks are a class of time-varying networks, which change their
topology according to a given time-ordered sequence of static networks (known
as subsystems). This paper investigates the reachability and controllability of
temporal continuous-time linear networks from a generic viewpoint, where only
the zero-nonzero patterns of subsystem matrices are known. We demonstrate that
the reachability and controllability on a single temporal sequence are generic
properties with respect to the parameters of subsystem matrices and the time
durations of subsystems. We then give explicit expressions for the minimal
subspace that contains the reachable set across all possible temporal sequences
(called overall reachable set). It is found that verifying the structural
reachability/controllability and structural overall reachability are at least
as hard as the structural target controllability verification problem of a
single system, implying that finding verifiable conditions for them is hard.
Graph-theoretic lower and upper bounds are provided for the generic dimensions
of the reachable subspace on a single temporal sequence and of the minimal
subspace that contains the overall reachable set. These bounds extend classical
concepts in structured system theory, including the dynamic graph and the
cactus, to temporal networks, and can be efficiently calculated using
graph-theoretic algorithms. Finally, applications of the results to the
structural controllability of switched linear systems are discussed.

Networks for Electrical Properties Tomography (PIFON-EPT), a novel deep
learning-based method that solves an inverse scattering problem based on noisy
and/or incomplete magnetic resonance (MR) measurements. \textit{Methods:} We
used two separate fully-connected neural networks, namely $B_1^{+}$ Net and EP
Net, to solve the Helmholtz equation in order to learn a de-noised version of
the input $B_1^{+}$ maps and estimate the object's EP. A random Fourier
features mapping was embedded into $B_1^{+}$ Net, to learn the high-frequency
details of $B_1^{+}$ more efficiently. The two neural networks were trained
jointly by minimizing the combination of a physics-informed loss and a data
mismatch loss via gradient descent. \textit{Results:} We performed several
numerical experiments, showing that PIFON-EPT could provide physically
consistent reconstructions of the EP and transmit field. Even when only $50\%$
of the noisy MR measurements were used as inputs, our method could still
reconstruct the EP and transmit field with average error $2.49\%$, $4.09\%$ and
$0.32\%$ for the relative permittivity, conductivity and $B_{1}^{+}$,
respectively, over the entire volume of the phantom. The generalized version of
PIFON-EPT that accounts for gradients of EP yielded accurate results at the
interface between regions of different EP values without requiring any boundary
conditions. \textit{Conclusion:} This work demonstrated the feasibility of
PIFON-EPT, suggesting it could be an accurate and effective method for EP
estimation. \textit{Significance:} PIFON-EPT can efficiently de-noise $B_1^{+}$
maps, which has the potential to improve other MR-based EPT techniques.
Furthermore, PIFON-EPT is the first technique that can reconstruct EP and
$B_{1}^{+}$ simultaneously from incomplete noisy MR measurements.

this problem by characterizing ABC voting rules within the broad and intuitive

by sequentially adding candidates that increase the score of the chosen

winning committees of size k can be derived from those of size k-1 by only
adding candidates and that these new candidates are chosen consistently. By
requiring additional conditions, we derive from this result also a
characterization of the prominent class of sequential Thiele rules. Finally, we
refine our results to characterize three well-known ABC voting rules, namely
sequential approval voting, sequential proportional approval voting, and
sequential Chamberlin-Courant approval voting.

mixture-averaged transport properties (low Lewis number flames) or setting
diffusivities of all species equal to heat diffusivity of the mixture

show a significant increase in turbulent burning velocity UT when the boundary

and strengthen the connection between novae and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) as
NSRs centered on SN Ia provide a lasting, unequivocal signpost to the single
degenerate progenitor type of that explosion. The only previous NSR simulation
used identical eruptions from a static white dwarf (WD). In this Paper, we
simulate the growth of NSRs alongside the natural growth/erosion of the central
WD, within a range of environments, accretion rates, WD temperatures, and
initial WD masses. The subsequent evolving eruptions create dynamic NSRs tens
of parsecs in radius comprising a low-density cavity, bordered by a hot ejecta
pile-up region, and surrounded by a cool high-density, thin, shell. Higher
density environments restrict NSR size, as do higher accretion rates, whereas
the WD temperature and initial mass have less impact. NSRs form around growing
or eroding WDs, indicating that NSRs also exist around old novae with low-mass
WDs. Observables such as X-ray and H$\alpha$ emission from the modelled NSRs
are derived to aid searches for more examples; only NSRs around high accretion

buyers with equal budgets. Each buyer is interested in exactly one pair of

goal of the seller is to set prices to the items such that the number of

  Formally, we are given an undirected graph where vertices represent items and

price exceeding the buyers' budgets are evicted. Any arrival order of the
buyers leads to a set of transactions that forms a maximal matching in this

matching. In order to measure the performance of a pricing strategy, we compare
the size of such a matching to the size of a maximum matching in the original

  using hierarchical generalised additive models",,,,,"stat.AP q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Background: Seasonal influenza causes a substantial burden on healthcare
services over the winter period when these systems are already under pressure.
Policies during the COVID-19 pandemic supressed the transmission of season
influenza, making the timing and magnitude of a potential resurgence difficult
to predict.
  Methods: We developed a hierarchical generalised additive model (GAM) for the
short-term forecasting of hospital admissions with a positive test for the
influenza virus sub-regionally across England. The model incorporates a
multi-level structure of spatio-temporal splines, weekly seasonality, and
spatial correlation. Using multiple performance metrics including interval
score, coverage, bias, and median absolute error, the predictive performance is
evaluated for the 2022/23 seasonal wave. Performance is measured against an
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) time series model.
  Results: The GAM method outperformed the ARIMA model across scoring rules at
both high and low-level geographies, and across the different phases of the
epidemic wave including the turning point. The performance of the GAM with a
14-day forecast horizon was comparable in error to the ARIMA at 7 days. The
performance of the GAM is found to be most sensitive to the flexibility of the
smoothing function that measures the national epidemic trend.
  Interpretation: This study introduces a novel approach to short-term
forecasting of hospital admissions with influenza using hierarchical, spatial,
and temporal components. The model is data-driven and practical to deploy using
information realistically available at time of prediction, addressing key
limitations of epidemic forecasting approaches. This model was used across the
winter for healthcare operational planning by the UK Health Security Agency and
the National Health Service in England.

wavelength range,...), their associated surveys (choice of setup), or their
parameterisation pipelines require methods that estimate which wavelengths
contain useful information.
  *Aim: We propose a method that establishes the usefulness (purity &
detectability) of an atomic line. We show two applications: a) optimising an
instrument, by comparing the number of useful lines at a given setup, and b)
optimising the line-list for a given setup by choosing the least blended lines
detectable at different signal-to-noise ratios.
  *Method: The method compares pre-computed synthetic stellar spectra
containing all of the elements and molecules with spectra containing the lines
of specific elements alone. Then, the flux ratios between the full spectrum and
the element spectrum are computed to estimate the line purities. The method
identifies automatically (i) the line's central wavelength, (ii) its
detectability based on its depth and a given S/N threshold and (iii) its
usefulness based on the purity ratio.
  *Results: We compare the three WEAVE high-resolution setups (Blue: 404-465nm,
Green: 473-545nm, Red: 595-685nm), and find that the Green+Red setup both
allows one to measure more elements and contains more useful lines. However,
there is a disparity in terms of which elements are detected, which we
characterise. We also study the performances of R~20 000 and R~6000 spectra
covering the entire optical range. Assuming a purity threshold of 60%, we find
that the HR setup contains a much wealthier selection of lines, for any of the
considered elements, whereas the LR has a ""loss"" of 50 to 90% of the lines even
for higher S/N.
  *Conclusions: The method provides a diagnostic of where to focus to get the
most out of a spectrograph, and is easy to implement for future instruments, or
for pipelines that require line masks.

survey that exploits the MWA's large field of view and voltage capture system
to survey the sky south of 30 degree in declination for pulsars and fast
transients in the 140-170 MHz band. The survey is enabled by the advent of the
Phase II MWA's compact configuration, which offers an enormous efficiency in
beam-forming and processing costs, thereby making an all-sky survey of this
magnitude tractable with the MWA. Even with the long dwell times of the survey
(4800 s), data collection can be completed in < 100 hours of telescope time,
while still retaining the ability to reach a limiting sensitivity of ~2-3 mJy.
Each observation is processed to generate ~5000-8000 tied-array beams that
tessellate the full ~610 square degree field of view, which are then processed
to search for pulsars. The voltage-capture recording allows a multitude of post
hoc processing options including the reprocessing of data for higher time
resolution. Due to the substantial computational cost in pulsar searches at low
frequencies, processing is undertaken in multiple passes: in the first pass, a
shallow survey is performed, where 10 minutes of each observation is processed,
reaching about one-third of the full search sensitivity. Here we present the
system overview and initial results. Further details including first pulsar
discoveries and a census of low-frequency detections are presented in a
companion paper. Future plans include deeper searches to reach the full
sensitivity and acceleration searches to target binary and millisecond pulsars.
Simulation analysis forecasts ~300 new pulsars upon the completion of full
processing. The SMART survey will also generate a complete digital record of
the low-frequency sky, which will serve as a valuable reference for future
pulsar searches planned with the low-frequency Square Kilometre Array.

occur at the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO), the Light-Ring (LR), and
the center of the star. The observed images and intensity profiles for an

Our results indicate that, in the absence of a light-ring, the presence of a
thin-shell produces a negligible effect in the observational properties of the
stars. However, when the spacetime features a light-ring, the portion of the
mass of the star that is stored in the thin-shell has a strong effect on its
observational properties, particularly in the magnitude of the central

fundamental questions: how to increase and what determines the embedding rate
of deep hiding. To this end, we first propose a novel Local Deep Hiding (LDH)
scheme that significantly increases the embedding rate by hiding large secret
images into small local regions of cover images. Our scheme consists of three
DNNs: hiding, locating, and revealing. We use the hiding network to convert a
secret image in a small imperceptible compact secret code that is embedded into
a random local region of a cover image. The locating network assists the
revealing process by identifying the position of secret codes in the stego
image, while the revealing network recovers all full-size secret images from
these identified local regions. Our LDH achieves an extremely high embedding
rate, i.e., $16\times24$ bpp and exhibits superior robustness to common image
distortions. We also conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate our scheme
under various system settings. We further quantitatively analyze the trade-off
between the embedding rate and image quality with different image restoration
algorithms.

(SMART) survey, including the survey design and search pipeline. While the
combination of MWA's large field-of-view and the voltage capture system brings
a survey speed of ~450 square degrees per hour, the survey progression relies
on the availability of compact configuration of the Phase II array. Over the
past few years, by taking advantage of multiple windows of opportunity when the
compact configuration was available, we have advanced the survey to 75%
completion. To date, about 10% of the data collected thus far have been
processed for a first-pass search, where 10 minutes of observation is processed
for dispersion measures out to 250 ${\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$, to realise a shallow
survey for long-period pulsars. The ongoing analysis has led to two new pulsar
discoveries, as well as an independent discovery and a rediscovery of a
previously incorrectly characterised pulsar, all from ~3% of the data for which
candidate scrutiny is completed. Here we describe the strategies for further
detailed follow-up including improved sky localisation and convergence to
timing solution, and illustrate them using example pulsar discoveries. The
processing has also led to re-detection of 120 pulsars in the SMART observing
band, bringing the total number of pulsars detected to date with the MWA to
180, and these are used to assess the search sensitivity of current processing
pipelines. The planned second-pass (deep survey) processing is expected to
yield a three-fold increase in sensitivity for long-period pulsars, and a
substantial improvement to millisecond pulsars by adopting optimal
de-dispersion plans. The SMART survey will complement the highly successful
Parkes High Time Resolution Universe survey at 1.2-1.5 GHz, and inform future
large survey efforts such as those planned with the low-frequency Square
Kilometre Array.

data-driven control design, this paper first presents a generic equivalence
lemma that shows a matrix constraint based on data, instead of the system

uncertain switched affine systems, robust model-based and then data-driven

locally through the canvas. In this work, deep learning is proposed as a tool
to perform these local densities and angle studies. We trained the model with
samples from 36 paintings by Vel\'azquez, Rubens or Ribera, among others. The
data preparation and augmentation are dealt with at a first stage of the

between threads. The U-Net with inception and Dice loss are presented as good
choices for this task. Densities and angles are then estimated based on the
segmented crossing points. We report test results of the analysis of a few
canvases and a comparison with methods in the frequency domain, widely used in
this problem. We concluded that this new approach succeeds in some cases where
the frequency analysis tools fail, while improving the results in others.
Besides, our proposal does not need the labeling of part of the to-be-processed

pairs of canvases by Vel\'azquez and Murillo, to conclude that the fabrics used

a tokamak, is resistant to disruptions. Unlike most tokamaks, the MST plasma is
surrounded by a close fitting highly conducting wall, with a resistive wall
penetration time two orders of magnitude longer than in JET or DIII-D, and
three times longer than in ITER. The MST can operate with edge q_a < 2, unlike
standard tokamaks. Simulations presented here indicate that the MST is unstable

were comparable to measurements in JET and DIII-D, theory and simulations
predict that disruptions would have been observed in MST. This is consistent
with the modeling herein, predicting that disruptions are caused by RWTMs and
RWMs. In the low q_a regime of MST, the RWTM asymptotically satisfies the RWM

deformations due to microlensing were identified. Detailed interpretations of
these features have nevertheless remained controversial. Based on 15 spectra
obtained from 2003 to 2018, we revisit the microlensing effect that distorts
the CIV broad emission line profile. We show that the microlensing-induced line
profile distortions in image A, although variable, are remarkably similar over
a period of 15 years. They are characterized by a strong magnification of the
blue part of the line profile, a strong demagnification of the red part of the
line profile, and a small-to-negligible demagnification of the line core. We
used the microlensing effect to constrain the broad emission-line region (BLR)
size, geometry, and kinematics. For this purpose, we modeled the deformation of
the emission lines considering three simple, representative BLR models: a
Keplerian disk, an equatorial wind, and a biconical polar wind, with various
inclinations with respect to the line of sight. We find that the observed
magnification profile of the CIV emission line can be reproduced with the
simple BLR models we considered, without the need for more complex BLR
features. The magnification appears dominated by the position of the BLR with
respect to the caustic network -- and not by the velocity-dependent size of the
BLR. The favored models for the CIV BLR are either the Keplerian disk or the
equatorial wind, depending on the orientation of the BLR axis with respect to
the caustic network. We also find that the polar wind model can be discarded.
We measured the CIV BLR half-light radius as $r_{1/2} = 2.8^{+2.0}_{-1.7}$
light-days. This value is smaller than the BLR radius expected from the
radius-luminosity relation derived from reverberation mapping, but it is still
in reasonable agreement given the large uncertainties.

designed flexibly based on the positions of the sender and receiver and the
size of the complete bipartite graph. We prove that the fidelity of the
algorithm is greater than
$1-2\epsilon_{1}-\epsilon_{2}-2\sqrt{2}\sqrt{\epsilon_{1}\epsilon_{2}}$ or
$1-(2+2\sqrt{2})\epsilon_{1}-\epsilon_{2}-(2+2\sqrt{2})\sqrt{\epsilon_{1}\epsilon_{2}}$

Although human injuries can be largely avoided in this way, all such solutions
have in common that real cooperation between humans and robots is hardly
possible and therefore the advantages of working with such systems cannot
develop its full potential. In human-robot collaboration scenarios, more
sophisticated solutions are required that make it possible to adapt the robot's

free robot movement, physical contact must be allowed for meaningful
interaction and not recognized as a collision. However, here lies a key
challenge for future systems: detecting human contact by using robot
proprioception and machine learning algorithms. This work uses the Deep Metric
Learning (DML) approach to distinguish between non-contact robot movement,
intentional contact aimed at physical human-robot interaction, and collision
situations. The achieved results are promising and show show that DML achieves
98.6\% accuracy, which is 4\% higher than the existing standards (i.e. a deep
learning network trained without DML). It also indicates a promising
generalization capability for easy portability to other robots (target robots)

density and elastic constants change discontinuously across the transition.
Densification of individual glassy samples occurs through a series of discrete
plastic events, each of which is accompanied by a vanishing shear modulus. This
is the signature of a series of elastic instabilities, similar to shear
transformation zones observed during shear yielding of glasses. We compare the
structure obtained during compression with a near-equilibrium form of amorphous

structures identical to nonequilibrium compression at low and high pressure,

particular determine the average metric tensor in overdense regions, and deduce
that the scale factor and the rate at which time progresses in such regions
differ significantly from the corresponding values expected on the average
space. We then quantitatively deduce how redshift and luminosity distance
measurements are affected by the bias, taking into account the perturbation of
the metric tensor. Using a value for the void fraction corresponding to the

the development of pre-trained model for time series analysis is the lack of a

leveraging language or CV models, pre-trained from billions of tokens, for time

feedforward layers of the residual blocks in the pre-trained language or image

critical to the measurement and control in the aerospace engineering. General
reconstruction methods for recovering the field, especially the deep learning
with more parameters and better representational ability, usually require large
amounts of labeled data which is unaffordable. To solve the problem, this paper
proposes Uncertainty Guided Ensemble Self-Training (UGE-ST), using plentiful
unlabeled data to improve reconstruction performance. A novel self-training
framework with the ensemble teacher and pretraining student designed to improve
the accuracy of the pseudo-label and remedy the impact of noise is first
proposed. On the other hand, uncertainty-guided learning is proposed to
encourage the model to focus on the highly confident regions of pseudo-labels
and mitigate the effects of wrong pseudo-labeling in self-training, improving
the performance of the reconstruction model. Experiments include the pressure
velocity field reconstruction of airfoil and the temperature field
reconstruction of aircraft system indicate that our UGE-ST can save up to 90%
of the data with the same accuracy as supervised learning.

framework for detecting discrimination in classifiers. CST aims to answer in an
actionable and meaningful way the intuitive question ""what would have been the
model outcome had the individual, or complainant, been of a different protected
status?"" It extends the legally-grounded situation testing of Thanh et al.
(2011) by operationalizing the notion of fairness given the difference using
counterfactual reasoning. For any complainant, we find and compare similar
protected and non-protected instances in the dataset used by the classifier to
construct a control and test group, where a difference between the decision
outcomes of the two groups implies potential individual discrimination. Unlike
situation testing, which builds both groups around the complainant, we build
the test group on the complainant's counterfactual generated using causal
knowledge. The counterfactual is intended to reflect how the protected
attribute when changed affects the seemingly neutral attributes used by the
classifier, which is taken for granted in many frameworks for discrimination.
Under CST, we compare similar individuals within each group but dissimilar
individuals across both groups due to the possible difference between the
complainant and its counterfactual. Evaluating our framework on two
classification scenarios, we show that it uncovers a greater number of cases
than situation testing, even when the classifier satisfies the counterfactual

module to localize facial pores; regression module to predict time-dependent
warping hyperparameters; and deformation module, taking warping hyperparameters
and pore segmentation labels as inputs, to precisely deform pores accordingly.

probe these changes via the magnetic-field dependence and gate
voltage-dependence of universal conductance fluctuations in top-gated nanowires

beyond the phase-breaking field, we find a factor of sqrt(2) reduction in the

symmetry, but can be explained by Fermi surface anisotropy. The concurrence

modifying the local density of photonic states around them. In the
weak-coupling limit, and according to the Fermi's Golden Rule, the emission
spectrum of a dye is given by the energy of all the possible radiative
transitions weighted by the probability of each of them to occur. By
engineering the resonance of a nanoantenna, one can selectively enhance
specific vibronic transitions of a dye molecule, thus shaping its emission
spectrum. Since interactions between emitters and nanoantennas are known to be
position dependent, we make here use of DNA origami to precisely place an
individual dye at different positions around a gold nanorod. We show how this
relative position between the nanorod and the emitter affects the emission
spectrum of the latter. In particular, we observe the appearance of a second
fluorescence peak whose wavelength and intensity are correlated with the
fundamental plasmonic resonance of the nanorod, which we extract from its

enhancement of transitions to different vibrational levels of the excitonic
ground state, whose energies are in resonance with the plasmonic one.
Furthermore, we argue that the drastic alteration of the fluorescence spectrum

an interesting phenomenon called ""self-fitting"". Self-fitting, i.e., the

naturally leads to the occurrence of CO. When self-fitting occurs, the network
experiences an obvious ""channel differentiation"" phenomenon that some
convolution channels accounting for recognizing self-information become
dominant, while others for data-information are suppressed. In this way, the
network can only recognize images with sufficient self-information and loses
generalization ability to other types of data. Based on self-fitting, we
provide new insights into the existing methods to mitigate CO and extend CO to
multi-step adversarial training. Our findings reveal a self-learning mechanism
in adversarial training and open up new perspectives for suppressing different

with a focus on its interaction with the external medium. We present new LOFAR

Chandra archival data. The new map at 144 MHz confirms that the source has a
complex morphology, possibly consistent with the `hybrid morphology'
classification. The large size of the source gave us the possibility to perform
a resolved radio spectral index analysis, a very unique opportunity for a
source at such high redshift. This reveals a tentative flattening of the radio
spectral index at the edge of the backflow in the Western lobe, which might be
indicating plasma compression. The spatial coincidence between this region and
the thermal X-ray bubble C suggests a causal connection between the two.
Contrary to previous estimates for the bright X-ray component A, we find that
inverse Compton scattering between the radio-emitting plasma of the Eastern
lobe and the CMB photons can account for a large fraction (~45%-80%) of its
total 0.5-7 keV measured flux. Finally, the X-ray bubble C, which is consistent
with a thermal origin, is found to be significantly overpressurised with
respect to the ambient medium. This suggests that it will tend to expand and
release its energy in the surroundings, contributing to the overall
intracluster medium heating. Overall, 103025+052430 gives us the chance to
investigate the interaction between AGN jets and the surrounding gas in a
system that is likely the predecessor of the rich galaxy clusters we all well

distinguishability from output data. Specifically, our quantification measures
how much data is required to tell apart two initial states, inducing a

determine a threshold above which two states can be considered distinguishable

segmentation errors and inaccurate shape recovery on unseen instances, which
both degrade the performance of shape estimation during deployment. In this
paper, we propose a category-level shape estimation method for densely

multi-view visual information fusion to achieve high segmentation accuracy, and
the instance shape is recovered by deforming the category templates with
diverse geometric transformations to obtain strengthened generalization
ability. Specifically, we first collect the multi-view RGB-D images of the
object clutters for point cloud reconstruction. Then we fuse the feature maps
representing the visual information of multi-view RGB images and the pixel
affinity learned from the clutter point cloud, where the acquired instance
segmentation masks of multi-view RGB images are projected to partition the

domain adaptability, we re-cast the domain adaptation problem as discriminative
clustering of target data, given strong privileged information provided by the
closely related, labeled source data. Technically, we use clustering objectives
based on a robust variant of entropy minimization that adaptively filters
target data, a soft Fisher-like criterion, and additionally the cluster
ordering via centroid classification. To distill discriminative source
information for target clustering, we propose to jointly train the network
using parallel, supervised learning objectives over labeled source data. We

These tasks are particularly challenging in dynamic networks where
communication across the network links may be unreliable, e.g., due to mobility

impossibility results and high time complexity lower bounds (i.e., linear in
the number of nodes $n$) for these tasks, even for oblivious message
adversaries where communication networks are rooted trees. However, such
deterministic adversarial models may be overly conservative, as many processes
in real-world settings are stochastic in nature rather than worst case.
  This paper initiates the study of broadcast and consensus on stochastic
dynamic networks, introducing a randomized oblivious message adversary. Our
model is reminiscent of the SI model in epidemics, however, revolving around
trees (which renders the analysis harder due to the apparent lack of
independence). In particular, we show that if information dissemination occurs
along random rooted trees, broadcast and consensus complete fast with high
probability, namely in logarithmic time. Our analysis proves the independence
of a key variable, which enables a formal understanding of the dissemination
process.
  More formally, for a network with $n$ nodes, we first consider the completely
random case where in each round the communication network is chosen uniformly
at random among rooted trees. We then introduce the notion of randomized
oblivious message adversary, where in each round, an adversary can choose $k$
edges to appear in the communication network, and then a rooted tree is chosen
uniformly at random among the set of all rooted trees that include these edges.
We show that broadcast completes in $O(k+\log n)$ rounds, and that this it is
also the case for consensus as long as $k \le 0.1n$.

Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) at the Planck Scale ($M_P \sim 10^{19}$
GeV). Using an effective field theory, this effect can be observed at low
energies in terms of new interactions with a strength of $\sim 1/M_P$. These
new interactions contain operators with LIV coefficients which can be
CPT-violating or CPT-conserving. In this work, we study in detail how these LIV
parameters modify the transition probabilities in the next-generation
long-baseline experiments, DUNE and T2HK. We evaluate the sensitivities of
these experiments in isolation and combination to constrain the off-diagonal
CPT-violating ($a_{e\mu}$, $a_{e\tau}$, $a_{\mu\tau}$) and CPT-conserving
($c_{e\mu}$, $c_{e\tau}$, $c_{\mu\tau}$) LIV parameters. We derive approximate
compact analytical expressions of $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\mu}\to\nu_\mu$
probabilities in the presence of these LIV parameters to explain our numerical
results. We explore the possible correlations and degeneracies between these
LIV parameters & 3$\nu$ parameters $\theta_{23}$ & $\delta_{\rm CP}$. We find
that for non-maximal values of $\theta_{23}$, there exist degenerate solutions
in its opposite octant for standalone DUNE and T2HK. These degeneracies
disappear when we combine the data from DUNE and T2HK. In case of no-show, we
place the expected bounds on these CPT-violating and CPT-conserving LIV
parameters at 95% C.L. using the standalone DUNE, T2HK, and their combination.
We observe that due to its access to a longer baseline and high-energy
neutrinos, DUNE has a better reach in probing all these LIV parameters as
compared to T2HK. Since the terms containing the CPT-conserving LIV parameters
are proportional to neutrino energy in oscillation probabilities, T2HK is

Furthermore, observational properties of galaxies depend on what these classes
of orbits are and on the presence of chaos in the systems. In the realistic
case in which the starting point for modeling is not a gravitational potential,
but an observed density distribution, we will require a gravitational theory to
make the connection between the stars that we see and the movement these stars
may be having. The argument can be turned upside down: understanding what
orbits may be allowed by each gravitational theory may give us a greater
insight on what these theories are and on how we can test them. Our aim is thus
to understand novel properties of orbits that are predicted by the latest
extension of the MOND phenomenology into the relativistic world. We integrated
orbits numerically in a fixed density distribution. The potential required for
such integration was obtained also numerically by assuming different
gravitational models. We find that thanks to the presence of a mass term in the
field equations, the theory can allocate new classes of orbits that do not
exist in Newtonian gravity nor standard MOND. We discuss consequences that
these new families of orbits can have in non-linear cosmological structure
formation as well as explore a possible alternative model for galactic

Ta$_{3}$S$_{4}$ is triggered by strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) between
the $d$-like orbitals of intercalated Ta atoms via the imaginary phonon modes
at M point. A 2$\times$1 CDW structure is identified, featuring
quasi-one-dimensional Ta chains, attributable to the competition between the

Best subset selection (BSS) is often considered the intuitive 'gold standard',
with its use being restricted only by its NP-hard nature. Alternatives such as
the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) or the elastic net
(Enet) have become methods of choice in high-dimensional settings. A recent
proposal represents BSS as a mixed integer optimization problem so that much
larger problems have become feasible in reasonable computation time. We present
an extensive neutral comparison assessing the variable selection performance,
in linear regressions, of BSS compared to forward stepwise selection (FSS),
Lasso and Enet. The simulation study considers a wide range of settings that
are challenging with regard to dimensionality (with respect to the number of
observations and variables), signal-to-noise ratios and correlations between
predictors. As main measure of performance, we used the best possible F1-score
for each method to ensure a fair comparison irrespective of any criterion for
choosing the tuning parameters, and results were confirmed by alternative
performance measures. Somewhat surprisingly, it was only in settings where the
signal-to-noise ratio was high and the variables were (nearly) uncorrelated
that BSS reliably outperformed the other methods, even in low-dimensional
settings. Further, the FSS's performance was nearly identical to BSS. Our
results shed new light on the usual presumption of BSS being, in principle, the
best choice for variable selection. Especially for correlated variables,
alternatives like Enet are faster and appear to perform better in practical
settings.

gravitational-wave standard-siren measurement of the Hubble constant, opening
up a new way to probe cosmology. The majority of the compact binary sources
observed in gravitational waves are however without bright electromagnetic
counterparts. In these cases, one can fall back on the ``dark standard siren''
approach to include information statistically from potential host galaxies. For
such a measurement, we need to be cautious about all possible sources of
systematic errors. In this paper, we begin to study the possible errors coming
from the galaxy catalogue sector, and in particular, look into the effect of
galaxy redshift uncertainties for the cases where these are photometry-based.
We recalculate the dark standard siren Hubble constant using the latest GWTC-3
events and associated galaxy catalogues, with different galaxy redshift
uncertainty models, namely, the standard Gaussian, a modified Lorentzian, and
no uncertainty at all. We find that not using redshift uncertainties at all can
lead to a potential bias comparable with other potential systematic effects
previously considered for the GWTC-3 $H_0$ measurement (however still small
compared to the overall statistical error in this measurement). The difference
between different uncertainty models leads to small differences in the results
for the current data; their impact is much smaller than the current statistical
errors and other potential sources of systematic errors which have been
considered in previous robustness studies.

it is either foliated by holomorphic submanifolds of dimension at least $2n-2p$
with tangent spaces in the kernel of the second fundamental form whose images
are open subsets of affine vector subspaces, or it is embedded holomorphically
in a Kaehler submanifold of $\R^{2n+p}$ of larger dimension than $2n$. This

is a first fundamental step for a possible classification of the

massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) communications systems. A core
challenge with designing HBF systems stems from the fact their application
often involves a non-convex, highly complex optimization of large dimensions.
In this paper, we propose HBF schemes that leverage data to enable efficient
designs for both the fully-connected HBF (FC-HBF) and dynamic sub-connected HBF
(SC-HBF) architectures. We develop a deep unfolding framework based on
factorizing the optimal fully digital beamformer into analog and digital terms
and formulating two corresponding equivalent least squares (LS) problems. Then,
the digital beamformer is obtained via a closed-form LS solution, while the
analog beamformer is obtained via ManNet, a lightweight sparsely-connected deep
neural network based on unfolding projected gradient descent. Incorporating
ManNet into the developed deep unfolding framework leads to the ManNet-based
FC-HBF scheme. We show that the proposed ManNet can also be applied to SC-HBF
designs after determining the connections between the radio frequency chain and
antennas. We further develop a simplified version of ManNet, referred to as
subManNet, that directly produces the sparse analog precoder for SC-HBF
architectures. Both networks are trained with an unsupervised training
procedure. Numerical results verify that the proposed ManNet/subManNet-based
HBF approaches outperform the conventional model-based and deep unfolded
counterparts with very low complexity and a fast run time. For example, in a
simulation with 128 transmit antennas, it attains a slightly higher spectral
efficiency than the Riemannian manifold scheme, but over 1000 times faster and
with a complexity reduction of more than by a factor of six (6).

models. Three data sets of various structures, interactions, and complexity
were constructed, which were supplemented by a real-world data set from the
Lending Club. We compare several methods for feature selection, categorical
handling, and null imputation. Performance is assessed using relative
comparisons among the chosen methodologies, including model prediction
variability. This paper is presented by the three groups of preprocessing
methodologies, with each section consisting of generalized observations. Each
observation is accompanied by a recommendation of one or more preferred
methodologies. Among feature selection methods, permutation-based feature
importance, regularization, and XGBoost's feature importance by weight are not
recommended. The correlation coefficient reduction also shows inferior
performance. Instead, XGBoost importance by gain shows the most consistency and
highest caliber of performance. Categorical featuring encoding methods show
greater discrimination in performance among data set structures. While there
was no universal ""best"" method, frequency encoding showed the greatest
performance for the most complex data sets (Lending Club), but had the poorest
performance for all synthetic (i.e., simpler) data sets. Finally, missing
indicator imputation dominated in terms of performance among imputation
methods, whereas tree imputation showed extremely poor and highly variable
model performance.

though three years have passed, the world continues to struggle with the virus.
Concerns are growing about the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of
infected individuals, who are more likely to experience depression, which can
have long-lasting consequences for both the affected individuals and the world.
Detection and intervention at an early stage can reduce the risk of depression
in COVID-19 patients. In this paper, we investigated the relationship between
COVID-19 infection and depression through social media analysis. Firstly, we
managed a dataset of COVID-19 patients that contains information about their
social media activity both before and after infection. Secondly,We conducted an
extensive analysis of this dataset to investigate the characteristic of
COVID-19 patients with a higher risk of depression. Thirdly, we proposed a deep
neural network for early prediction of depression risk. This model considers
daily mood swings as a psychiatric signal and incorporates textual and
emotional characteristics via knowledge distillation. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms baselines in detecting
depression risk, with an AUROC of 0.9317 and an AUPRC of 0.8116. Our model has
the potential to enable public health organizations to initiate prompt

devices in fiber lasers for the production of single-longitudinal-mode

presents a transition from Q-switched state to continuous wave (CW) state,
accompanying irregular mode-hopping, in an erbium-doped fiber laser with a
heavily-doped DPG centered at 1549.95 nm. Our results demonstrate that the
transition between these two states can be achieved by adjusting the pump
power. The repetition frequency of the Q-switched pulse increases monotonically
with the increasing pump power, while the pulse duration initially narrows and
then expands because the reduced peak intensity weakens the nonlinear effect.
Additionally, modulation peaks are evident on both the Q-switched pulse train
and the CW background, which are induced by the irregular mode-hopping caused
by the DPG. Furthermore, we observe that the central wavelength fluctuates
within a range of 0.05 nm. These results provide valuable insight into the DPG

semantics-preserving, we generate Fourier amplitude images and combine them
with source domain phase images, exploiting the widely believed conjecture from
signal processing that amplitude spectra mainly determines image style, while
phase data mainly captures image semantics. To synthesise a worst-case domain

adversarially. Specifically, we exploit the maximum classifier discrepancy
(MCD) principle from DA that relates the target domain performance to the
discrepancy of classifiers in the model hypothesis space. By Bayesian
hypothesis modeling, we express the model hypothesis space effectively as a

adversarial MCD minimisation feasible. On the DomainBed benchmark including the

explore the impact on gravitational-wave observables. We model charged and
neutral pions as a non-interacting Boson gas with a chosen, constant effective
mass. We add the contributions of pions, which can occur as a condensate or as
a thermal population, to existing temperature and composition dependent
equations of state. Compared to the models without pions, the presence of a
pion condensate decreases the characteristic properties of cold, non-rotating
neutron stars such as the maximum mass, the radius and the tidal deformability.
We conduct relativistic hydrodynamical simulations of neutron star mergers for
these modified equations of state models and compare to the original models,
which ignore pions. Generally, the inclusion of pions leads to a softening of
the equation of state, which is more pronounced for smaller effective pion
masses. We find a shift of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave frequency
by up to 150~Hz to higher frequencies and a reduction of the threshold binary
mass for prompt black-hole formation by up to 0.07~$M_\odot$. We evaluate
empirical relations between the threshold mass or the dominant postmerger
gravitational-wave frequency and stellar parameters of nonrotating neutron
stars. These relations are constructed to extract these stellar properties from
merger observations and are built based on large sets of equation of state
models which do not include pions. Comparing to our calculations with pions, we
find that these empirical relations remain valid to good accuracy, which
justifies their use although they neglect a possible impact of pions. We also
address the mass ejection by neutron star mergers and observe a moderate
enhancement of the ejecta mass by a few ten per cent. (abridged)

observe a roughly triangular network of dense filaments. We detect 9 of the
dense starless cores embedded within these filaments in polarisation, finding
that the plane-of-sky orientation of the core-scale magnetic field lies roughly
perpendicular to the filaments in almost all cases. We also find that the
large-scale magnetic field orientation measured by Planck is not correlated
with any of the core or filament structures, except in the case of the
lowest-density core. We propose a scenario for early prestellar evolution that
is both an extension to, and consistent with, previous models, introducing an
additional evolutionary transitional stage between field-dominated and
matter-dominated evolution, observed here for the first time. In this scenario,
the cloud collapses first to a sheet-like structure. Uniquely, we appear to be
seeing this sheet almost face-on. The sheet fragments into filaments, which in
turn form cores. However, the material must reach a certain critical density
before the evolution changes from being field-dominated to being
matter-dominated. We measure the sheet surface density and the magnetic field
strength at that transition for the first time and show consistency with an
analytical prediction that had previously gone untested for over 50 years

asynchronous exponential growth of solutions, associated with a well-defined,
log-concave, equilibrium distribution. Although the equation is non-linear and
non-conservative, our result shares some similarities with the Bakry-Emery

level of the Fisher information. Moreover, the key lemma for proving

orbit, when surrounded by an accretion disk, is expected to be dominated by a

Collaboration. The characterization of both features - ring and shadow -
depends on the interaction between the background geometry and the accretion
disk, thus being a fertile playground to test our theories on the nature of
compact objects and the gravitational field itself in the strong-field regime.
In this work we use both features in order to test a continuous family of
solutions interpolating between regular black holes and horizonless compact
objects, which arise within the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld theory of
gravity, a viable extension of Einstein's General Relativity (GR). To this end
we consider seven distinctive classes of such configurations (five black holes
and two traversable wormholes) and study their optical appearances under
illumination by a geometrically and optically thin accretion disk, emitting
monochromatically with three analytic intensity profiles previously suggested
in the literature. We build such images and consider the sub-ring structure
created by light rays crossing the disk more than once and existing on top of
the main ring of radiation. We discuss in detail the modifications as compared
to their GR counterparts, the Lyapunov exponents of nearly unstable orbits, as
well as the differences between black hole and traversable wormholes for the
three intensity profiles. In addition we consider the properties of the shadow
region and link them to the calibrated expectations by the EHT Collaboration.

image-text representations, facilitating advances in numerous downstream tasks,
including zero-shot classification and text-to-image generation. Nevertheless,
existing VLMs exhibit a prominent well-documented limitation - they fail to
encapsulate compositional concepts such as counting. We introduce a simple yet
effective method to improve the quantitative understanding of VLMs, while
maintaining their overall performance on common benchmarks. Specifically, we
propose a new counting-contrastive loss used to finetune a pre-trained VLM in
tandem with its original objective. Our counting loss is deployed over
automatically-created counterfactual examples, each consisting of an image and
a caption containing an incorrect object count. For example, an image depicting
three dogs is paired with the caption ""Six dogs playing in the yard"". Our loss
encourages discrimination between the correct caption and its counterfactual
variant which serves as a hard negative example. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to extend CLIP's capabilities to object counting.
Furthermore, we introduce ""CountBench"" - a new image-text counting benchmark
for evaluating a model's understanding of object counting. We demonstrate a
significant improvement over state-of-the-art baseline models on this task.
Finally, we leverage our count-aware CLIP model for image retrieval and
text-conditioned image generation, demonstrating that our model can produce
specific counts of objects more reliably than existing ones.

multiple surrogated limit states. Specifically, PC-Kriging-based surrogate
models are actively trained considering a variance correction derived from
leave-one-out cross-validation error information, whereas the sequential
learning scheme relies on U-function-derived metrics. The proposed active
learning approaches are tested in a highly nonlinear structural reliability
setting, whereas in a more practical application, failure and repair events are
stochastically predicted in the aftermath of a ship collision against an
offshore wind substructure. The results show that a balanced computational
budget administration can be effectively achieved by successively targeting the

geometry departs from very specific cases for which analytical solutions are
available, like e.g. the penny-shaped crack geometry. Here, we extend the
first-order theory of Gao and Rice (1987), and predict the distribution of the
mode I stress intensity factor $K_\mathrm{I}$ along the front of a tensile
coplanar crack that is slightly perturbed from a reference penny-shaped
configuration, up to second order in the perturbation amplitude. Our theory is
validated against analytical solutions available for embedded elliptical
cracks, and its range of validity is further assessed using numerical
simulations performed on cosine front perturbations of varying mode and
amplitude. It is then used to develop a homogenization framework for the
toughness of weakly disordered media. The effective toughness and its
fluctuations are bridged quantitatively to the intensity of the toughness
fluctuations and their spatial structure. Our theoretical predictions are
compared to the results of $\sim 1$ million simulations of crack propagation
building on our second-order theory and Fast Fourier Transforms. We show that
the impact of toughness heterogeneities is size-dependent, as they generally
weaken the material when the crack size is lower or comparable to the typical
heterogeneity size, but reinforces it otherwise. It results in an apparent
R-curve behavior of the brittle composite at the macroscale.

  Neural Networks","Submitted to the Computerized Medical Imaging and Graphics Journal",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, large strides have been taken in developing machine learning
methods for dermatological applications, supported in part by the success of
deep learning (DL). To date, diagnosing diseases from images is one of the most
explored applications of DL within dermatology. Convolutional neural networks
(ConvNets) are the most common (DL) method in medical imaging due to their
training efficiency and accuracy, although they are often described as black
boxes because of their limited explainability. One popular way to obtain
insight into a ConvNet's decision mechanism is gradient class activation maps
(Grad-CAM). A quantitative evaluation of the Grad-CAM explainability has been
recently made possible by the release of DermXDB, a skin disease diagnosis
explainability dataset which enables explainability benchmarking of ConvNet
architectures. In this paper, we perform a literature review to identify the
most common ConvNet architectures used for this task, and compare their
Grad-CAM explanations with the explanation maps provided by DermXDB. We
identified 11 architectures: DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0, InceptionV3,
InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, MobileNetV2, NASNetMobile, ResNet50, ResNet50V2,
VGG16, and Xception. We pre-trained all architectures on an clinical skin
disease dataset, and fine-tuned them on a DermXDB subset. Validation results on
the DermXDB holdout subset show an explainability F1 score of between
0.35-0.46, with Xception displaying the highest explainability performance.
NASNetMobile reports the highest characteristic-level explainability
sensitivity, despite it's mediocre diagnosis performance. These results
highlight the importance of choosing the right architecture for the desired
application and target market, underline need for additional explainability
datasets, and further confirm the need for explainability benchmarking that
relies on quantitative analyses.

efficient numerical methods to optimize our protocol parameters and show that

in dynamic epistemic logic (DEL). This paper studies a recently introduced form
of partial (more precisely, topic-based) communication. This type of
communication allows for modelling scenarios of multi-agent collaboration and
negotiation, and it is particularly well-suited for situations in which sharing
all information is not feasible/advisable. After presenting results on
invariance and complexity of model checking, the paper compares partial
communication to public announcements, probably the most well-known type of
communication in DEL. It is shown that the settings are, update-wise,
incomparable: there are scenarios in which the effect of a public announcement
cannot be replicated by partial communication, and vice versa. Then, the paper
shifts its attention to strategic topic-based communication. It does so by
extending the language with a modality that quantifies over the topics the
agents can `talk about'. For this new framework, it provides a complete
axiomatisation, showing also that the new language's model checking problem is
PSPACE-complete. The paper closes showing that, in terms of expressivity, this
new language of arbitrary partial communication is incomparable to that of

of data augmentation and (3) SGD already becomes stable when initialized from

the random effects to follow a discrete distribution with an unknown number of

clusters. At each iteration of a tailored Expectation Maximization algorithm,
the two closest estimated support points for which the confidence regions
overlap collapse. Unlike the related state-of-the-art methods that rely on
arbitrary thresholds to determine the merging of close discrete masses, the
proposed approach relies on conventional statistical confidence levels, thereby
avoiding the use of discretionary tuning parameters. To demonstrate the

in metropolitan areas from a game-theoretic point of view. In these games
agents of different types each strategically select a node on a given graph
that models the residential area to maximize their individual utility. The
latter solely depends on the types of the agents on neighboring nodes and it
has been a standard assumption to consider utility functions that are monotone
in the number of same-type neighbors. This simplifying assumption has recently
been challenged since sociological poll results suggest that real-world agents
actually favor diverse neighborhoods.
  We contribute to the recent endeavor of investigating residential segregation
models with realistic agent behavior by studying Jump Schelling Games with
agents having a single-peaked utility function. In such games, there are empty
nodes in the graph and agents can strategically jump to such nodes to improve
their utility. We investigate the existence of equilibria and show that they
exist under specific conditions. Contrasting this, we prove that even on simple
topologies like paths or rings such stable states are not guaranteed to exist.
Regarding the game dynamics, we show that improving response cycles exist
independently of the position of the peak in the utility function. Moreover, we
show high almost tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy and the Price of
Stability with respect to the recently proposed degree of integration, which
counts the number of agents with a diverse neighborhood and which serves as a
proxy for measuring the segregation strength. Last but not least, we show that
computing a beneficial state with high integration is NP-complete and, as a
novel conceptual contribution, we also show that it is NP-hard to decide if an

pointing mirror is used to move the field-of-view of the optical transceiver,
which was studied as an alternative scheme to the baselined telescope pointing
architecture. The simulation includes a representative model of the far-field
intensity distribution and the beam detection process using a realistic
detector model, and a model of the expected platform jitter for two alternative
control modes with different associated jitter spectra. For optimally adjusted
detector settings and accounting for the actual far-field beam profile, we
investigate the dependency of acquisition performance on the jitter spectrum
and the track-width of the search spiral, while scan speed and detector
integration time are varied over several orders of magnitude. Results show a
strong dependency of the probability for acquisition failure on the width of
the auto-correlation function of the jitter spectrum, which we compare to
predictions of analytical models. Depending on the choice of scan speed, three
different regimes may be entered which differ in failure probability by several
orders of magnitude. We then use these results to optimize the acquisition
architecture for the given jitter spectra with respect to failure rate and
overall duration, concluding that the full constellation could be acquired on
average in less than one minute. Our method and findings can be applied to any
other space mission using a fine-steering mirror for link acquisition.

comprehending the intricate phases in heavy-fermion compounds. However, the
role of the itinerant magnetic order, which is driven by the conducting (c)
electrons, has been largely uncharted in the context of heavy-fermion systems
due to the scarcity of material candidates. Here we demonstrate the coexistence
of the coherent Kondo screening and d-orbital ferromagnetism in material system
La$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$Co$_2$As$_2$, through comprehensive thermodynamic and
electrical transport measurements. Additionally, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we further observe the f-orbit-dominated
bands near the Fermi level ($E_f$) and signatures of the f-c hybridization
below the magnetic transition temperature, providing strong evidence of Kondo
lattice state in the presence of ferromagnetic order. Remarkably, by changing
the ratio of Ce/La, we observe a substantial enhancement of the anomalous Hall
effect (AHE) in the Kondo lattice regime. The value of the Hall conductivity
quantitatively matches with the first-principle calculation that optimized with
our ARPES results and can be attributed to the large Berry curvature (BC)
density engendered by the topological nodal rings composed of the Ce-4f and
Co-3d orbitals at $E_f$. Our findings point to the realization of a new
platform for exploring correlation-driven topological responses in a novel

  Approach for Community Detection",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Community is a fundamental and critical characteristic of an undirected
social network, making community detection be a vital yet thorny issue in
network representation learning. A symmetric and non-negative matrix
factorization (SNMF) model is frequently adopted to address this issue owing to
its great interpretability and scalability. However, it adopts a single latent
factor matrix to represent an undirected network for precisely representing its
symmetry, which leads to loss of representation learning ability due to the
reduced latent space. Motivated by this discovery, this paper proposes a novel
Constraints Fusion-induced Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (CFS)
model that adopts three-fold ideas: a) Representing a target undirected network
with multiple latent factor matrices, thus preserving its representation
learning capacity; b) Incorporating a symmetry-regularizer that preserves the
symmetry of the learnt low-rank approximation to the adjacency matrix into the
loss function, thus making the resultant detector well-aware of the target
network's symmetry; and c) Introducing a graph-regularizer that preserves local
invariance of the network's intrinsic geometry, thus making the achieved
detector well-aware of community structure within the target network.
Extensively empirical studies on eight real-world social networks from
industrial applications demonstrate that the proposed CFS model significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in achieving highly-accurate community
detection results.

requests with flexible bandwidth granularities to cope with the demands of new

services are offered by taking requested bandwidth profile into consideration,
instead of assigning a fixed amount of bandwidth to each request. New
techniques are developed for the resource management of the elastic optical
networks to realize services with a specified bandwidth profile, consisting of
minimum, average, and maximum required number of spectrum slots, in addition to
holding time. In this work, two new schemes are proposed to realize such
services, exploiting a probabilistic spectrum partitioning approach. This new
probabilistic spectrum partitioning scheme is devised to enhance the chance of
accommodating requests and consequently lower request blocking probability. It
enforces different probabilities to contributing spectrum partitions in a
certain service realization. Taking advantage of this probabilistic spectrum
partitioning and a profile-based routing, we introduce two multistage spectrum
assignment methods to make a certain lightpath meet the requested service

realize the requests with the probability of 0.993, for erlangs lower than 400.

future fusion reactors, such as ITER, which they are expected to provide with
up to 33 MW of power to heat the fusion plasma. The negative hydrogen ions are
extracted from a RF plasma, in which a magnetic filter field cools down the
electrons reaching the so-called expansion region and allows the formation of
negative ions near the apertures in the plasma grid. To further improve the
production of negative ions, cesium is usually evaporated inside the source and
deposited onto the plasma walls, reducing the work function of the surfaces.
This dramatically increases the density of negative hydrogen ions near the
surfaces, causing the transition to an electronegative plasma in the vicinity
of the plasma grid. This condition can be observed with Langmuir probes.
  In this paper we use the measurements provided by the Langmuir probe system
embedded in the plasma grid of SPIDER, the prototype ion source of ITER NBIs,
to determine the the density of negative ions. A fitting method based on the
determination of the collection area of the different plasma species is
proposed and adapted to SPIDER experimental condition, taking into account the
shape of the probes and the local topology of the magnetic field. The method is
then applied to the experimental data, determining the densities of the
positive and negative ions and of the electrons during a plasma pulse. Finally,
a vertical array of four probes in the plasma grid is used to assess the
vertical profile of plasma parameters.

accurately forecasting the number and probability of failing structures,

However, predicting financial distress for Small and Medium Enterprises is
challenging due to their inherent ambiguity, leading to increased funding costs
and decreased chances of receiving funds. While several strategies have been
developed for effective FCP, their implementation, accuracy, and data security
fall short of practical applications. Additionally, many of these strategies
perform well for a portion of the dataset but are not adaptable to various
datasets. As a result, there is a need to develop a productive prediction model
for better order execution and adaptability to different datasets. In this
review, we propose a feature selection algorithm for FCP based on element

models rely mainly on financial statements and disregard the timeliness of
organization tests. Therefore, we propose a corporate FCP model that better
aligns with industry practice and incorporates the gathering of thin-head

demonstrate that this strategy can improve the forecast efficiency of financial

Intrinsic Diffusion Modeling, a novel approach to this problem based on
combining diffusion generative models with scientific knowledge about the

increases the smoothness of the generation space allowing for significantly
faster and more accurate generative processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness

time domain data of multisignals have been developed. Although some signals are
important for correct classification, others are not. When data that do not
include important signals for classification are taken as the CNN input layer,
the calculation, memory, and data collection costs increase. Therefore,
identifying and eliminating nonimportant signals from the input layer are
important. In this study, we proposed features gradient-based signals selection
algorithm (FG-SSA), which can be used for finding and removing nonimportant
signals for classification by utilizing features gradient obtained by the
calculation process of grad-CAM. When we define N as the number of signals, the
computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear time O(N), that
is, it has a low calculation cost. We verified the effectiveness of the
algorithm using the OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition dataset, which is an open
dataset comprising acceleration signals of human activities. In addition, we
checked the average 6.55 signals from a total of 15 acceleration signals (five
triaxial sensors) that were removed by FG-SSA while maintaining high
generalization scores of classification. Therefore, the proposed algorithm
FG-SSA has an effect on finding and removing signals that are not important for
CNN-based classification.

how and when existing prediction models for time-to-event data can be used as
plug-in estimators for potential outcomes. We then investigate whether
competing events present new challenges for HTE estimation -- in addition to
the standard confounding problem --, and find that, because there are multiple
definitions of causal effects in this setting -- namely total, direct and
separable effects --, competing events can act as an additional source of
covariate shift depending on the desired treatment effect interpretation and
associated estimand. We theoretically analyze and empirically illustrate when
and how these challenges play a role when using generic machine learning
prediction models for the estimation of HTEs.

psychology, as it predicts many consequential outcomes such as mental and
physical health and explains human behaviour. With the widespread use of social
networks as a means of communication, it is becoming increasingly important to
develop models that can automatically and accurately read the essence of
individuals based solely on their writing. In particular, the convergence of
social and computer sciences has led researchers to develop automatic
approaches for extracting and studying ""hidden"" information in textual data on
the internet. The nature of this thesis project is highly experimental, and the
motivation behind this work is to present detailed analyses on the topic, as
currently there are no significant investigations of this kind. The objective
is to identify an adequate semantic space that allows for defining the
personality of the object to which a certain text refers. The starting point is
a dictionary of adjectives that psychological literature defines as markers of
the five major personality traits, or Big Five. In this work, we started with
the implementation of fully-connected neural networks as a basis for
understanding how simple deep learning models can provide information on hidden
personality characteristics. Finally, we use a class of distributional
algorithms invented in 2013 by Tomas Mikolov, which consists of using a
convolutional neural network that learns the contexts of words in an
unsupervised way. In this way, we construct an embedding that contains the
semantic information on the text, obtaining a kind of ""geometry of meaning"" in
which concepts are translated into linear relationships. With this last
experiment, we hypothesize that an individual writing style is largely coupled
with their personality traits.

a classification model in a supervised learning setting. Using said training

results verify the validity of our approach and show that our model sets a very
strong benchmark for this problem. We also interpret our models by visualizing
the word importance given by the trained model, which indicates the model is
capable to extract high-level semantic information of input documents. Finally,

linear displacement sensor using microwave methods. The microwave sensor
circuit employs a cylindrical dielectric resonator proximity coupled to a pair
of orthogonal microstrip lines formed on a microwave substrate. The DR rests on
the substrate and is free to be displaced between the strips on the 2D plane of
the substrate. The strips excite the particular resonant mode of the DR, the
intensity of which varies with the DRs proximity to the strips. The DRs
position can thus be read out in terms of the 2 port S parameters of the
circuit, at a fixed frequency determined by the resonant mode of DR. Such fixed
frequency sensors are robust in operation and cost effective in realization, an
important aspect of this sensor. Initial one-dimensional positioning
simulations of the sensor through three fixed representative paths on the
substrate reveal that the S parameters vary monotonically with the
displacement. Prototype measurements reveal a dynamic range of 23 mm for
horizontal or vertical displacement, and 30 mm for diagonal displacement at the
resonant frequency of 3.67 GHz. Next, 2D positioning test is conducted and a
technique for one to one mapping from the S parameters to the 2D position is
demonstrated. To conclude, the proposed sensors performance is compared with
that of existing 2D sensors.

ground truth deformations that simulate the large deformations that occur
between image acquisitions. However, the quality of the multi-organ Finite
Element Method (FEM)-based simulations is dependent on the patient-specific
external forces and mechanical properties assigned to the organs. A common
approach to calibrate these simulation parameters is through optimization,
finding the parameter settings that optimize the match between the outcome of
the simulation and reality. When considering inherently simplified organ
models, we hypothesize that the optimal deformations of one organ cannot be
achieved with a single parameter setting without compromising the optimality of
the deformation of the surrounding organs. This means that there will be a
trade-off between the optimal deformations of adjacent organs, such as the

multi-objective optimization approach where the trade-off between organ
deformations can be assessed after optimization. We showcase what the extent of

in terms of the controllability of the generated image content. A multi-network
combined text-to-building facade image generating method is proposed in this
work. We first fine-tuned the Stable Diffusion model on the CMP Fa-cades
dataset using the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) approach, then we ap-ply the
ControlNet model to further control the output. Finally, we contrast-ed the
facade generating outcomes under various architectural style text con-tents and
control strategies. The results demonstrate that the LoRA training approach
significantly decreases the possibility of fine-tuning the Stable Dif-fusion
large model, and the addition of the ControlNet model increases the
controllability of the creation of text to building facade images. This
pro-vides a foundation for subsequent studies on the generation of
architectural images.

promotion/relegation of teams. Arguably, the best known ranking method relies
on scores obtained by cumulating the points associated with the wins and the
draws of all teams, which are then ranked by sorting the score obtained. There
are two main problems with this ranking method. First, the meaning of the
ranking is undefined, and, second, it depends on the relative value of the wins
that is arbitrarily set. We remedy these issues by introducing a probabilistic
model of the game results and by showing an interpretation of the ranking that
is consistent with the model. We also propose a methodology to estimate the
parameter of the model which allows us to objectively determine the value of
the win. In particular, using data from the association football (soccer), we
show that the value of the win is close to five (5) points.

classical weakly prime submodules over non-commutative graded rings which is a
generalization of the concept of graded classical weakly prime submodules over
commutative graded rings. We investigate the structure of these types of
submodules in various categories of graded modules.

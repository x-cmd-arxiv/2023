  Models' Capacity for Augmenting Cross-Domain Analogical Creativity",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cross-domain analogical reasoning is a core creative ability that can be
challenging for humans. Recent work has shown some proofs-of concept of Large
language Models' (LLMs) ability to generate cross-domain analogies. However,
the reliability and potential usefulness of this capacity for augmenting human
creative work has received little systematic exploration. In this paper, we
systematically explore LLMs capacity to augment cross-domain analogical
reasoning. Across three studies, we found: 1) LLM-generated cross-domain
analogies were frequently judged as helpful in the context of a problem
reformulation task (median 4 out of 5 helpfulness rating), and frequently (~80%
of cases) led to observable changes in problem formulations, and 2) there was
an upper bound of 25% of outputs bring rated as potentially harmful, with a
majority due to potentially upsetting content, rather than biased or toxic
content. These results demonstrate the potential utility -- and risks -- of
LLMs for augmenting cross-domain analogical creativity.

precision manipulation allows for a wider range of applications. Traditional
methods for improving robot arm precision rely on error compensation. However,
these methods are often not robust and lack adaptability. Learning-based
methods offer greater flexibility and adaptability, while current researches
show that they often fall short in achieving high precision and struggle to
handle many scenarios requiring high precision. In this paper, we propose a
novel high-precision robot arm manipulation framework based on online iterative
learning and forward simulation, which can achieve positioning error
(precision) less than end-effector physical minimum displacement. Additionally,
we parallelize multiple high-precision manipulation strategies to better
combine online iterative learning and forward simulation. Furthermore, we
consider the joint angular resolution of the real robot arm, which is usually
neglected in related works. A series of experiments on both simulation and real
UR3 robot arm platforms demonstrate that our proposed method is effective and
promising. The related code will be available soon.

institutions take multiple approaches in the collection of paediatric data,
leading to different implementations of standards and potentially limited
utility for reuse. To overcome these challenges, the conect4children consortium
has developed a cross-cutting paediatric data dictionary (CCPDD). The
dictionary was built over three phases - scoping (including a survey sent out
to ten industrial and 34 academic partners to gauge interest), creation of a
longlist and consensus building for the final set of terms. The dictionary was
finalized during a workshop with attendees from academia, hospitals, industry
and CDISC. The attendees held detailed discussions on each data item and
participated in the final vote on the inclusion of the item in the CCPDD. Nine
industrial and 34 academic partners responded to the survey, which showed
overall interest in the development of the CCPDD. Following the final vote on
27 data items, three were rejected, six were deferred to the next version and a
final opinion was sought from CDISC. The first version of the CCPDD with 25
data items was released in August 2019. The continued use of the dictionary has
the potential to ensure the collection of standardized data that is
interoperable and can later be pooled and reused for other applications. The
dictionary is already being used for case report form creation in three
clinical trials. The CCPDD will also serve as one of the inputs to the
Paediatric User Guide, which is being developed by CDISC.

this paper proposes a better approach of using heterogeneous wireless networks
consisting of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Mobile Cellular Networks

of this research is to provide accurate readings to the server, and very low

proposed system that consists of several innovative services, namely smart

fact minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the distribution
of the real data and that of the model. However, this approach forces the model
to distribute non-zero (sometimes large) probability mass to all training
samples regardless of their quality. Moreover, in the attempt to cover the
low-probability regions in the data distribution, the model systematically
overestimates the probability of corrupted text sequences, which we conjecture
is one of the main reasons for text degeneration during autoregressive
decoding. To remedy this problem, we leverage the total variation distance
(TVD) with its robustness to outliers, and develop practical bounds to apply it
to language generation. Then, we introduce the TaiLr objective that balances
the tradeoff of estimating TVD. Intuitively, TaiLr downweights real data
samples that have low model probabilities with tunable penalization intensity.
Experimental results show that our method alleviates the overestimation of
degenerated sequences without sacrificing diversity and improves generation
quality on a wide range of text generation tasks.

related to models of visual neuroscience. This connection benefits engineering
but, more interestingly, the freedom to optimize deep networks in different
ways, make them an excellent tool to explore the principles behind visual
perception (both human and artificial). Recently, a myriad of networks have
been successfully optimized for many interesting visual tasks. Although these
nets were not specifically designed to predict image quality or other
psychophysics, they have shown surprising human-like behavior. The reasons for
this remain unclear.
  In this work, we perform a thorough analysis of the perceptual properties of
pre-trained nets (particularly their ability to predict image quality) by
isolating different factors: the goal (the function), the data (learning
environment), the architecture, and the readout: selected layer(s), fine-tuning
of channel relevance, and use of statistical descriptors as opposed to plain
readout of responses.
  Several conclusions can be drawn. All the models correlate better with human
opinion than SSIM. More importantly, some of the nets are in pair of
state-of-the-art with no extra refinement or perceptual information. Nets
trained for supervised tasks such as classification correlate substantially
better with humans than LPIPS (a net specifically tuned for image quality).
Interestingly, self-supervised tasks such as jigsaw also perform better than
LPIPS. Simpler architectures are better than very deep nets. In simpler nets,
correlation with humans increases with depth as if deeper layers were closer to
human judgement. This is not true in very deep nets. Consistently with reports
on illusions and contrast sensitivity, small changes in the image environment
does not make a big difference. Finally, the explored statistical descriptors

of the classical marginal sensitivity model using f-divergence. To construct
our estimator, we leverage the kernel method to obtain a tractable
approximation to the conditional moment constraints, which traditional
non-sharp estimators failed to take into account. In the theoretical analysis,
we provide a condition for the choice of the kernel which guarantees no
specification error that biases the lower bound estimation. Furthermore, we
provide consistency guarantees of policy evaluation and learning. In the

successful with existing data but is known to be sub-optimal on small angular
scales ($\ell > 3000$) for experiments with low noise levels. Future
experiments will provide better observations in this regime, but these
techniques will remain statistically limited by their approximations. We show
that correlations between fluctuations of the large-scale temperature gradient
power of the CMB sourced by $\ell < 2000$, and fluctuations to the local
small-scale temperature power reveal a lensing signal which is prominent in
even the real-space pixel statistics across a CMB temperature map. We present
the development of the Small Correlated Against Large Estimator (SCALE), a
novel estimator for the CMB lensing spectrum which offers promising
complementary analysis alongside other reconstruction techniques in this
regime. The SCALE method computes correlations between both the
large/small-scale temperature gradient power in harmonic space, and it is able
to quantitatively recover unbiased statistics of the CMB lensing field without
the need for map-level reconstruction. SCALE can outperform quadratic estimator

As part of the observing strategy for the exoplanet survey, signatures of
massive companions such as RV trends are used to reduce the priority of those
stars. However, this RV information remains useful for studying the stellar
multiplicity of nearby M~dwarfs. To search for companions around such
``deprioritized"" M~dwarfs, we observed 14 IRD-SSP targets using Keck/NIRC2
observations with pyramid wavefront sensing at NIR wavelengths, leading to high
sensitivity to substellar-mass companions within a few arcseconds. We detected
two new companions (LSPM~J1002+1459~B and LSPM~J2204+1505~B) and two new
candidates that are likely companions (LSPM~J0825+6902~B and LSPM~J1645+0444~B)
as well as one known companion. Including two known companions resolved by the
IRD fiber injection module camera, we detected seven (four new) companions at

colors with the spectral library suggests that LSPM~J2204+1505~B and
LSPM~J0825+6902~B are located at the boundary between late-M and early-L

The NIRC2 detection limits could constrain potential substellar-mass companions

By cross-matching the COSMOS2020 catalog, we identify the MgII and CIV host

parameter of 250 kpc, a tight correlation is seen between strong MgII
equivalent width and the host galaxy star formation rate. The covering fraction
fc of strong MgII selected galaxies, which is the ratio of absorbing galaxy in
a certain galaxy population, shows significant evolution in the main-sequence

the co-evolution of strong MgII absorbing gas and the main-sequence galaxies at

patterns of transmission caused by heterogeneous group sizes and infection risk
varying by orders of magnitude in different settings, like indoor versus

therefore more similar to complex contagions than the simple contagions of

it also opens the door to effective models that capture complex features of

resolving all of the statistically significant physical scales becomes
prohibitively large, such that it is necessary in many cases to perform
simulations that are under-resolved with respect to the underlying flow
physics. For nodal discontinuous spectral element approximations of these
under-resolved flows, the collocation projection of the nonlinear flux onto the
space spanned by the solution approximation can introduce aliasing errors which
can result in numerical instabilities, leading to nonphysical solutions or the
failure of the scheme altogether. In Dzanic and Witherden (J. Comput. Phys.,
468, 2022), an entropy-based adaptive filtering approach was introduced for the
purpose of mitigating numerical instabilities stemming from high-order
approximations of discontinuous flow features. It was observed by the authors
that this parameter-free shock-capturing approach, referred to as entropy
filtering, also allowed for the robust simulation of high Reynolds number flows
on under-resolved meshes that would typically be unstable due to aliasing
errors. This technical note explores this effect and presents a comparison to
standard anti-aliasing approaches through implicit large eddy simulations of a
NACA0021 in deep stall from the DESider project as presented by Park et al.

heart of the intelligent control of these AEPs is the policy guiding the
sequential experiments, which is to choose the location to carry out the next
experiment. In such cases, a balance between exploitation and exploration must
be achieved. A Bayesian Optimization (BO) framework with Expected Improvement
based (EI-based) acquisition function can effectively search the MDS and guide
where to conduct the next experiments so that the underlying relationship can
be identified with a smaller number of experiments. The traditional BO
framework tries to optimize a black box objective function in a sequential
manner by relying on a single model. However, this single-model approach does
not account for model uncertainty. Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) addresses
this issue by working with multiple models and thus considering the uncertainty
in the models. In this work, we first apply the conventional BO algorithm with
the most popular EI-based experiment policy in a real-life fatigue dataset for
steel to predict the fatigue strength of steel. Afterward, we apply BMA to the
same dataset by working with a set of predictive models and compare the
performance of BMA with the traditional BO algorithm, which relies on a single
model for approximation. We compare the results in terms of RMSE and find that
BMA performs better than EI-based BO in the prediction task by considering the
model uncertainty in its framework.

method with a multimodal time-delay neural network that outperforms the current
best model by 1.0 F1 points, using less than a tenth of its parameters to
process embeddings. We streamline a speech recognizer to efficiently output
hidden layer latent vectors as audio embeddings for punctuation restoration, as
well as BERT to extract meaningful text embeddings. By using forced alignment
and temporal convolutions, we eliminate the need for multi-head attention-based
fusion, greatly increasing computational efficiency but also raising
performance. EfficientPunct sets a new state of the art, in terms of both
performance and efficiency, with an ensemble that weights BERT's purely
language-based predictions slightly more than the multimodal network's
predictions.

insulators with chiral symmetry in three dimensions. We build a model of the
topological insulators in the class AIII by coupling lower dimensional models
of $\mathbb{Z}$ classes. By coupling the two AIII models related by
time-reversal symmetry we construct other chiral symmetric topological
insulators that may also possess additional symmetries (the time-reversal
and/or particle-hole).
  There are two different chiral symmetry operators for the coupled model, that
correspond to two distinct ways of defining the sublattices. The integer
topological invariant (the winding number) in case of weak coupling can be
either the sum or difference of indices of the basic building blocks, dependent
on the preserved chiral symmetry operator. The value of the topological index
in case of weak coupling is determined by the chiral symmetry only and does not
depend on the presence of other symmetries. For $\mathbb{Z}$ topological
classes AIII, DIII, and CI with chiral symmetry are topologically equivalent,
it implies that a smooth transition between the classes can be achieved if it
connects the topological sectors with the same winding number. We demonstrate
this explicitly by proving that the gapless surface states remain robust in
$\mathbb{Z}$ classes as long as the chiral symmetry is preserved, and the
coupling does not close the gap in the bulk. By studying the surface states in
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classes, we show that class CII and AII are
distinct, and can not be adiabatically connected.

  (ICRA) 2023",,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Quadruped animal locomotion emerges from the interactions between the spinal
central pattern generator (CPG), sensory feedback, and supraspinal drive
signals from the brain. Computational models of CPGs have been widely used for
investigating the spinal cord contribution to animal locomotion control in
computational neuroscience and in bio-inspired robotics. However, the
contribution of supraspinal drive to anticipatory behavior, i.e. motor behavior
that involves planning ahead of time (e.g. of footstep placements), is not yet
properly understood. In particular, it is not clear whether the brain modulates
CPG activity and/or directly modulates muscle activity (hence bypassing the
CPG) for accurate foot placements. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction of supraspinal drive and a CPG in an anticipatory locomotion
scenario that involves stepping over gaps. By employing deep reinforcement
learning (DRL), we train a neural network policy that replicates the
supraspinal drive behavior. This policy can either modulate the CPG dynamics,
or directly change actuation signals to bypass the CPG dynamics. Our results
indicate that the direct supraspinal contribution to the actuation signal is a
key component for a high gap crossing success rate. However, the CPG dynamics
in the spinal cord are beneficial for gait smoothness and energy efficiency.
Moreover, our investigation shows that sensing the front feet distances to the
gap is the most important and sufficient sensory information for learning gap
crossing. Our results support the biological hypothesis that cats and horses
mainly control the front legs for obstacle avoidance, and that hind limbs
follow an internal memory based on the front limbs' information. Our method
enables the quadruped robot to cross gaps of up to 20 cm (50% of body-length)
without any explicit dynamics modeling or Model Predictive Control (MPC).

widespread expectations, we obtain sizeable two-photon widths of scalar,

two-photon rate of the glueball candidate $f_0(1710)$ is not too large to
permit a glueball interpretation, but could be even much higher. We also
discuss the so-called exotic scalar glueball, which in the

the alternative scenario of the so-called fragmented scalar glueball. Employing
the exotic scalar glueball for the latter, much smaller two-photon rates are
predicted for the ground-state glueball despite a larger total width;
relatively large two-photon rates would then apply to the excited scalar
glueball described by the predominantly dilatonic scalar glueball. In either

this strategy to discovering thermoelectric materials where we prioritize

insufficiency, organisms of one out of the species strategically perform a
trade-off between reproduction and mobility. When prioritising exploring more
extensive areas, organisms aim to maximise the chances of acquiring resources
to regain high energy levels. Through simulation, we examine the effect of
survival behaviour on species segregation and spatial patterns. Our outcomes
show that the trade-off between offspring generation and accelerated movement
effectively protects individuals from death due to lack of energy. Moreover,
the risk of being eliminated by an enemy in the cyclic game reduces due to the
behavioural strategy. Considering a three-state model, we quantify how the
trade-off parameter controls the organisms' energy recovery. Computing the
median organisms' survival time, we find that although individuals performing
the trade-off strategy may live longer, the organisms of other species are
negatively affected by a life expectancy reduction. Our research may elucidate

proceed. For undo logging, LPs and DPs are both performed synchronously to
ensure that the region commits synchronously. For redo logging, DPs can be
performed asynchronously, but LPs are performed synchronously to ensure that
the region commits synchronously. In both cases, waiting for synchronous
persist operations (LP or DP) at the end of an atomic region causes atomic
regions to incur high latency.
  To tackle this limitation, we propose ASAP, a hardware logging solution that
allows atomic regions to commit asynchronously. That is, once the end of an
atomic region is reached, instruction execution may proceed without waiting for
outstanding persist operations to complete. As such, both LPs and DPs can be
performed asynchronously. The challenge with allowing atomic regions to commit
asynchronously is that it can lead to control and data dependence violations in
the commit order of the atomic regions, leaving data in an unrecoverable state
in case of a crash. To address this issue, ASAP tracks and enforces control and
data dependencies between atomic regions in hardware to ensure that the regions
commit in the proper order.

scientific computing as their functional representation of partial differential

hash encoding into PINNs to improve the training efficiency, as such encoding
offers a locally-aware (at multi resolution) coordinate inputs to the neural

investigate the robustness of calculating the derivatives of such hash encoded

the PINN loss terms. We propose to replace the automatic differentiation with
finite-difference calculations of the derivatives to address the discontinuous
nature of such derivatives. We also share the appropriate ranges for the hash
encoding hyperparameters to obtain robust derivatives. We test the proposed
method on three problems, including Burgers equation, Helmholtz equation, and
Navier-Stokes equation. The proposed method admits about a 10-fold improvement
in efficiency over the vanilla PINN implementation.

this restriction, the derivation of hybrid dynamical equations is clear
conceptually and simple technically. Jump and diffusive dynamics follow in the
form of hybrid master equations. Their stochastic interpretation (called
unravellings) is derived. We discuss gauge-type ambiguities, problems of

that hybrid formalism is equivalent with standard Markovian theory of
time-continuous quantum measurement (monitoring) on one hand, and is a
motivating alternative formalism on the other hand.

novel in that we explicitly model spatial variation in parameters in the
production-function estimation. We accomplish this by allowing both the
input-elasticity and productivity parameters to be unknown functions of the
firm's geographic location and estimate them via local kernel methods. This
allows the production technology to vary across space, thereby accommodating
neighborhood influences on firm production. In doing so, we are also able to
examine the role of cross-location differences in explaining the variation in
operational productivity among firms. Our model is superior to the alternative
spatial production-function formulations because it (i) explicitly estimates
the cross-locational variation in production functions, (ii) is readily
reconcilable with the conventional production axioms and, more importantly,
(iii) can be identified from the data by building on the popular proxy-variable
methods, which we extend to incorporate locational heterogeneity. Using our
methodology, we study China's chemicals manufacturing industry and find that
differences in technology (as opposed to in idiosyncratic firm heterogeneity)
are the main source of the cross-location differential in total productivity in

paper, we design and implement P4L: a privacy preserving peer-to-peer learning
system for users to participate in an asynchronous, collaborative learning
scheme without requiring any sort of infrastructure or relying on differential
privacy. Our design uses strong cryptographic primitives to preserve both the
confidentiality and utility of the shared gradients, a set of peer-to-peer
mechanisms for fault tolerance and user churn, proximity and cross device
communications. Extensive simulations under different network settings and ML
scenarios for three real-life datasets show that P4L provides competitive
performance to baselines, while it is resilient to different poisoning attacks.
We implement P4L and experimental results show that the performance overhead
and power consumption is minimal (less than 3mAh of discharge).

  in Language Models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite increasingly fluent, relevant, and coherent language generation,
major gaps remain between how humans and machines use language. We argue that a
key dimension that is missing from our understanding of language models (LMs)
is the model's ability to interpret and generate expressions of uncertainty.
Whether it be the weatherperson announcing a chance of rain or a doctor giving
a diagnosis, information is often not black-and-white and expressions of
uncertainty provide nuance to support human-decision making. The increasing
deployment of LMs in the wild motivates us to investigate whether LMs are
capable of interpreting expressions of uncertainty and how LMs' behaviors
change when learning to emit their own expressions of uncertainty. When
injecting expressions of uncertainty into prompts (e.g., ""I think the answer
is...""), we discover that GPT3's generations vary upwards of 80% in accuracy
based on the expression used. We analyze the linguistic characteristics of
these expressions and find a drop in accuracy when naturalistic expressions of
certainty are present. We find similar effects when teaching models to emit
their own expressions of uncertainty, where model calibration suffers when
teaching models to emit certainty rather than uncertainty. Together, these
results highlight the challenges of building LMs that interpret and generate
trustworthy expressions of uncertainty.

ability to retain modeling flexibility while avoiding the curse of

large datasets may incur a high computational cost and is thus infeasible in

that approximates an OA to achieve the minimax optimality. Our asymptotic
analyses demonstrate that an IES subsample converges to an OA and that the
backfitting algorithm over the subsample converges to a unique solution even if
the predictors are highly dependent in the original big data. The proposed IES
method is also shown to be numerically appealing via simulations and a real

approach reduces the controllability problem to the study of a spectral problem
which is solved by using the Paley-Wiener method introduced by Rosier [16].
Then, the issue is to establish when a certain quotient of entire functions
still turn out to be an entire function. It can be viewed as a problem of
factoring an entire function that, depending on the control configuration,
leads to the study of a transcendental equation. Finally, by using the
contraction mapping theorem we derive the local controllability for the full

number of small satellites being launched into space on Low Earth orbit (LEO)

way which downloads such data to a ground station (GS) to train a machine
learning (ML) model is not desirable due to the bandwidth limitation and
intermittent connectivity between LEO satellites and the GS. Satellite edge
computing (SEC), on the other hand, allows each satellite to train an ML model
onboard and uploads only the model to the GS which appears to be a promising
concept. This paper proposes FedLEO, a novel federated learning (FL) framework
that realizes the concept of SEC and overcomes the limitation (slow
convergence) of existing FL-based solutions. FedLEO (1) augments the
conventional FL's star topology with ``horizontal'' intra-plane communication
pathways in which model propagation among satellites takes place; (2) optimally
schedules communication between ``sink'' satellites and the GS by exploiting
the predictability of satellite orbiting patterns. We evaluate FedLEO

FedLEO drastically expedites FL convergence, without sacrificing -- in fact it
considerably increases -- the model accuracy.

Time-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a
Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a
proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series
representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and
the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters
the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the
subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters.

demonstrate that SLAC-Time outperforms the baseline K-means clustering

experiments show that the TBI phenotypes identified by SLAC-Time can be
potentially used for developing targeted clinical trials and therapeutic

demonstrated significant gains over blind speech separation. However, it has
two limitations. First, substantial performance degradation is observed when
the coming directions of two sounds are close. Second, the result highly relies
on the precise estimation of the speaker's direction. To overcome these issues,
this paper proposes 3D features and an associated 3D neural beamformer for
multi-channel speech separation. Previous works in this area are extended in
two important directions. First, the traditional 1D directional beam patterns
are generalized to 3D. This enables the model to extract speech from any target
region in the 3D space. Thus, speakers with similar directions but different
elevations or distances become separable. Second, to handle the speaker
location uncertainty, previously proposed spatial feature is extended to a new
3D region feature. The proposed 3D region feature and 3D neural beamformer are
evaluated under an in-car scenario. Experimental results demonstrated that the
combination of 3D feature and 3D beamformer can achieve comparable performance
to the separation model with ground truth speaker location as input.

solely be attributed to the yarn itself. Thus, knitting can be viewed as an
additive manufacturing technique that allows for stitch-by-stitch programming
of elastic properties and has applications in many fields ranging from soft

elementwise embedding, in which a material (semantic unit) is abstracted into a
horizontal concatenation of lower-dimensional element (character) embeddings.
While elements are always characters, materials are arbitrary levels of
semantic units so it generalizes to any type of tokenization. To focus only on
the important letters, the $n^{th}$ spellings of each semantic unit are aligned
in $n^{th}$ attention heads, then concatenated back into original forms
creating unique embedding representations; they are jointly projected thereby
determining own contextual importance. Technically, this framework is achieved
by passing a sequence of materials, each consists of $v$ elements, to a
transformer having $h=v$ attention heads. As a pure embedding technique,
elementwise embedding replaces the $w$-dimensional embedding table of a
transformer model with $256$ $c$-dimensional elements (each corresponding to
one of UTF-8 bytes) where $c=w/v$. Using this novel approach, we show that the
standard transformer architecture can be reused for all levels of language
representations and be able to process much longer sequences at the same

overhead. BERT trained with elementwise embedding outperforms its subword
equivalence (original implementation) in multilabel patent document
classification exhibiting superior robustness to domain-specificity and data

demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method by successfully
transferring these enhancements to differently architected transformers CANINE

manipulation of both chemical potential and sublattice potential using a double
gate setup. Although a finite sublattice potential can stabilize the fSTP with
a possible higher-order band topology, because it also breaks the relevant
symmetry, the stability of the corner modes is not guaranteed. Here we show
that the fSTP on the honeycomb lattice gives BOTS under nonzero sublattice
potential, thus the corner modes can survive as long as the boundary is gapped.
Also, by examining the large sublattice potential limit where the honeycomb
lattice can be decomposed into two triangular lattices, we show that the
boundary modes in the normal state are the quintessential ingredient leading to
the BOTS. Thus the effective boundary Hamiltonian becomes nothing but the
Hamiltonian for Kitaev chains, which eventually gives the corner modes of the
BOTS.

However, most existing JSCC studies only focus on single-input single-output

image transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. As the
complexity of an image determines its reconstruction difficulty, the JSCC
achieves quite different reconstruction performances on different images.
Moreover, we observe that the images with higher reconstruction qualities are
generally more robust to the noise, and can be allocated with less
communication resources than the images with lower reconstruction qualities.
Based on this observation, we propose an adaptive channel state information
(CSI) feedback scheme for precoding, which improves the effectiveness by
adjusting the feedback overhead. In particular, we develop a performance
evaluator to predict the reconstruction quality of each image, so that the
proposed scheme can adaptively decrease the CSI feedback overhead for the
transmitted images with high predicted reconstruction qualities in the JSCC
system. We perform experiments to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can
significantly improve the image transmission performance with much-reduced

for networking hitherto used salient input features to interpret a controller's
behavior. However, these feature-based solutions do not completely explain the
controller's decision-making process. Often, operators are interested in
understanding the impact of a controller's actions on performance in the
future, which feature-based solutions cannot capture.
  In this paper, we present CrystalBox, a framework that explains a
controller's behavior in terms of the future impact on key network performance
metrics. CrystalBox employs a novel learning-based approach to generate
succinct and expressive explanations. We use reward components of the DRL
network controller, which are key performance metrics meaningful to operators,
as the basis for explanations. CrystalBox is generalizable and can work across
both discrete and continuous control environments without any changes to the
controller or the DRL workflow. Using adaptive bitrate streaming and congestion
control, we demonstrate CrytalBox's ability to generate high-fidelity
future-based explanations. We additionally present three practical use cases of
CrystalBox: cross-state explainability, guided reward design, and network
observability.

heart of quantum science and technologies. A significant case is the creation
of quantum light sources in which coupling between single photons and phonons
can be controlled and harnessed to enable quantum information transduction.
Here, we report the deterministic creation of quantum emitters featuring highly
tunable coupling between excitons and phonons. The quantum emitters are formed
in strain-induced quantum dots created in homobilayer semiconductor WSe2. The
colocalization of quantum confined interlayer excitons and THz interlayer
breathing mode phonons, which directly modulate the exciton energy, leads to a
uniquely strong phonon coupling to single-photon emission. The single-photon
spectrum of interlayer exciton emission features a single-photon purity >83%
and multiple phonon replicas, each heralding the creation of a phonon Fock
state in the quantum emitter. Owing to the vertical dipole moment of the
interlayer exciton, the phonon-photon interaction is electrically tunable in a
wide range, promising to reach the strong coupling regime. Our result
demonstrates a new type of solid-state quantum excitonic-optomechanical system
at the atomic interface that emits flying photonic qubits coupled with
stationary phonons, which could be exploited for quantum transduction and
interconnection.

computation in recent years. Unfortunately, FL faces two critical challenges
that hinder its actual performance: data distribution heterogeneity and high
resource costs brought by large foundation models. Specifically, the non-IID
data in different clients make existing FL algorithms hard to converge while
the high resource costs, including computational and communication costs that
increase the deployment difficulty in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
propose an effective yet simple method, named FedCLIP, to achieve fast
generalization and personalization for CLIP in federated learning. Concretely,
we design an attention-based adapter for the large model, CLIP, and the rest
operations merely depend on adapters. Lightweight adapters can make the most
use of pretrained model information and ensure models be adaptive for clients
in specific tasks. Simultaneously, small-scale operations can mitigate the
computational burden and communication burden caused by large models. Extensive
experiments are conducted on three datasets with distribution shifts.
Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that FedCLIP significantly
outperforms other baselines (9% overall improvements on PACS) and effectively
reduces computational and communication costs (283x faster than FedAVG). Our

requires carrying out string theory path integral over the near horizon

localized to a finite dimensional subspace using the unbroken supersymmetries
of the near horizon geometry. We discuss several issues that need to be
resolved before one can declare victory: (1) delta-function normalizable
eigenmodes of the kinetic operator do not form a representation of the
supersymmetry algebra since the Killing spinors grow exponentially as we
approach the asymptotic boundary of the near horizon geometry, (2) the
logarithmic contributions coming from various one loop determinants are
sensitive to the ultraviolet cut-off and therefore without detailed knowledge
of the ultraviolet cut-off one cannot determine the order one correction to the
entropy that could depend on the ratios of the charges, (3) the results of
index theorem indicate that there are additional flat directions of the
localization action, at least at the quadratic order, than what has been
considered so far. We also discuss a limited application of localization
techniques to carry out the path integral over the zero modes of the metric and
the gravitino, and get a finite answer. This is consistent with the results of
arXiv:0905.2686 and shows that for computing BPS black hole entropy it is not
necessary to regulate the path integral over these zero modes using the

per turn, has been widely applied in task-oriented dialog systems to provide
expressive and efficient system responses. Existing policy models usually
imitate action combinations from the labeled multi-action dialog examples. Due
to data limitations, they generalize poorly toward unseen dialog flows. While
reinforcement learning-based methods are proposed to incorporate the service
ratings from real users and user simulators as external supervision signals,
they suffer from sparse and less credible dialog-level rewards. To cope with
this problem, we explore to improve multi-action dialog policy learning with
explicit and implicit turn-level user feedback received for historical
predictions (i.e., logged user feedback) that are cost-efficient to collect and
faithful to real-world scenarios. The task is challenging since the logged user
feedback provides only partial label feedback limited to the particular
historical dialog actions predicted by the agent. To fully exploit such
feedback information, we propose BanditMatch, which addresses the task from a
feedback-enhanced semi-supervised learning perspective with a hybrid objective
of semi-supervised learning and bandit learning. BanditMatch integrates
pseudo-labeling methods to better explore the action space through constructing
full label feedback. Extensive experiments show that our BanditMatch
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by generating more concise and
informative responses. The source code and the appendix of this paper can be

specialized access controls such as Android permissions to safeguard OEM and
Android services from third-party applications. However, when OEMs introduce
differentiating features, they often create vulnerabilities due to their
inability to properly reconfigure this complex policy combination. To address
this, we introduce the POLYSCOPE tool, which triages Android filesystem access
control policies to identify attack operations - authorized operations that may
be exploited by adversaries to elevate their privileges. POLYSCOPE has three
significant advantages over prior analyses: it allows for the independent
extension and analysis of individual policy models, understands the flexibility
untrusted parties have in modifying access control policies, and can identify
attack operations that system configurations permit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of POLYSCOPE by examining the impact of Scoped Storage on
Android, revealing that it reduces the number of attack operations possible on
external storage resources by over 50%. However, because OEMs only partially
adopt Scoped Storage, we also uncover two previously unknown vulnerabilities,
demonstrating how POLYSCOPE can assess an ideal scenario where all apps comply
with Scoped Storage, which can reduce the number of untrusted parties accessing
attack operations by over 65% on OEM systems. POLYSCOPE thus helps Android OEMs
evaluate complex access control policies to pinpoint the attack operations that
require further examination.

tuning the ensemble and subsample sizes of randomized ensembles. Our method
builds on two main ingredients: two initial estimators for small ensemble sizes
using out-of-bag errors and a novel risk extrapolation technique leveraging the
structure of the prediction risk decomposition. By establishing uniform
consistency over ensemble and subsample sizes, we show that ECV yields
$\delta$-optimal (with respect to the oracle-tuned risk) ensembles for squared
prediction risk. Our theory accommodates general ensemble predictors, requires
mild moment assumptions, and allows for high-dimensional regimes where the
feature dimension grows with the sample size. As an illustrative example, we
employ ECV to predict surface protein abundances from gene expressions in
single-cell multiomics using random forests. Compared to sample-split
cross-validation and K-fold cross-validation, ECV achieves higher accuracy
avoiding sample splitting. Meanwhile, its computational cost is considerably
lower owing to the use of the risk extrapolation technique. Further numerical
results demonstrate the finite-sample accuracy of ECV for several common

Cram\'er-Rao bound. Closely related concepts, such as quantum variance and
co-variance, fidelity susceptibility, entanglement entropy and Berry curvature

We demonstrate a state preparation method via the novel measurement-induced

prepared by applying quantum circuits that exploit the back-action caused by

reinitialized to known states, the system qubits are steered from arbitrary
initial states to desired final states. We show results of the method by
preparing arbitrary qubit states and arbitrary qutrit (three-level) states on
contemporary, cloud-accessible, quantum computers. We also demonstrate that the
state convergence can be accelerated by utilizing the readouts of the ancilla

  However, most existing methods focus on obscuring targets captured on the

  They smear the targeted objects in the physical world with the elaborated
adversarial patches, which can only slightly sway the aerial detectors'
prediction and with weak attack transferability.
  To address the above issues, we propose to perform Contextual Background
Attack (CBA), a novel physical attack framework against aerial detection, which
can achieve strong attack efficacy and transferability in the physical world
even without smudging the interested objects at all.
  Specifically, the targets of interest, i.e. the aircraft in aerial images,
are adopted to mask adversarial patches.
  The pixels outside the mask area are optimized to make the generated
adversarial patches closely cover the critical contextual background area for
detection, which contributes to gifting adversarial patches with more robust
and transferable attack potency in the real world.
  To further strengthen the attack performance, the adversarial patches are
forced to be outside targets during training, by which the detected objects of
interest, both on and outside patches, benefit the accumulation of attack
efficacy.
  Consequently, the sophisticatedly designed patches are gifted with solid
fooling efficacy against objects both on and outside the adversarial patches
simultaneously.
  Extensive proportionally scaled experiments are performed in physical
scenarios, demonstrating the superiority and potential of the proposed
framework for physical attacks.
  We expect that the proposed physical attack method will serve as a benchmark
for assessing the adversarial robustness of diverse aerial detectors and

which an adversary could tamper with a small number of model parameter bits to
break the integrity of DNNs. To mitigate such threats, a batch of defense
methods are proposed, focusing on the untargeted scenarios. Unfortunately, they
either require extra trustworthy applications or make models more vulnerable to
targeted BFAs. Countermeasures against targeted BFAs, stealthier and more
purposeful by nature, are far from well established.
  In this work, we propose Aegis, a novel defense method to mitigate targeted
BFAs. The core observation is that existing targeted attacks focus on flipping
critical bits in certain important layers. Thus, we design a dynamic-exit
mechanism to attach extra internal classifiers (ICs) to hidden layers. This
mechanism enables input samples to early-exit from different layers, which
effectively upsets the adversary's attack plans. Moreover, the dynamic-exit
mechanism randomly selects ICs for predictions during each inference to
significantly increase the attack cost for the adaptive attacks where all
defense mechanisms are transparent to the adversary. We further propose a
robustness training strategy to adapt ICs to the attack scenarios by simulating
BFAs during the IC training phase, to increase model robustness. Extensive
evaluations over four well-known datasets and two popular DNN structures reveal
that Aegis could effectively mitigate different state-of-the-art targeted
attacks, reducing attack success rate by 5-10$\times$, significantly
outperforming existing defense methods.

  fiber using fast Fourier transform",,,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Transmission matrix (TM) linearly maps the incident and transmitted complex
fields, and has been used widely due to its ability to characterize scattering
media. It is computationally demanding to reconstruct the TM from intensity
images measured by a reference-less experimental setup. Removing reference beam
for interference gains the advantage of simple experimental setup. However, the
long computational time still limits its practical application. We propose an
efficient reference-less TM retrieval method for multimode fiber (MMF). Our
method adopts a data acquisition scheme which employs Fourier transform matrix
in the design of the incident fields. We develop a nonlinear optimization
algorithm to solve the TM retrieval problem in a parallel manner. The data
acquisition scheme allows the algorithm to be implemented with fast Fourier
transform (FFT), and hence achieves great efficiency improvement. Further, our
method acquires intensity images at a defocus plane and correct the error of
relative phase offset of TM recovered from the intensity images measured at one
fixed plane. We validate the proposed TM retrieval method with both simulations
and experiments. By using FFT, our TM retrieval algorithm achieves 1200x
speed-up in computational time, and recovers $2286 \times 8192$ TM of a 0.22 NA
and $50 \ \mu m$ diameter MMF with 124.9 seconds by a computer of 32 CPU cores.
With the advantages of efficiency and the correction of phase offset, our
method paves the way for the application of reference-less TM retrieval in real
practice.

of the semantics of each API, to ensure that security entitlements are enforced
consistently and completely across all APIs that could perform the same
function for an attacker. Unfortunately, APIs are not designed to be
""semantically orthogonal"" and they often overlap, for example by offering
different performance points for the same functionality. This leaves it to the
security mechanism to discover and account for API proxies, i.e., groups of
APIs which together approximate the functionality of some other API. Lacking a
complete view of the structure of the API-proxy relationship, current security
mechanisms address it in an ad-hoc and reactive manner, by updating the
implementation when new API proxies are uncovered and abused by attackers.
  We analyze the problem of discovering API-proxy relationships and show that
its complexity makes it NP-complete, which makes computing exact information
about API proxies prohibitively expensive for modern API surfaces that consist
of tens of thousands of APIs. We then propose a simple heuristic algorithm to
approximate the same API-proxy information and argue that this
overapproximation can be safely used for security purposes, with only the
downside of some utility loss. We conclude with a number of open problems of
both theoretical and practical interest and with potential directions towards
new solutions for the API-proxy problem.

produce a large number of solutions and feed them into downstream processing.
Various enumeration algorithms have been developed for this purpose. An
enumeration algorithm produces all solutions of a problem instance without
repetition. To be a statistically meaningful representation of the solution
space, solutions are required to be enumerated in uniformly random order. This
paper studies a set of self-reducible NP-problems in three hierarchies, where
the problems are polynomially countable ($Sr_{NP}^{FP}$), admit FPTAS
($Sr_{NP}^{FPTAS}$), and admit FPRAS ($Sr_{NP}^{FPRAS}$), respectively. The
trivial algorithm based on a (almost) uniform generator is in fact inefficient.
We provide a new insight that the (almost) uniform generator is not the end of
the story. More efficient algorithmic frameworks are proposed to enumerate
solutions in uniformly random order for problems in these three hierarchies.
(1) For problems in $Sr_{NP}^{FP}$, we show a random-order enumeration
algorithm with polynomial delay (PDREnum); (2) For problems in
$Sr_{NP}^{FPTAS}$, we show a Las Vegas random-order enumeration algorithm with
expected polynomial delay (PDLVREnum); (3) For problems in $Sr_{NP}^{FPRAS}$,
we devise a fully polynomial delay Atlantic City random-order enumeration
algorithm with expected delay polynomial in the input size and the given error
probability $\delta$ (FPACREnum), which has a probability of at least
$1-\delta$ becoming a Las Vegas random-order enumeration algorithm. Finally, to
further improve the efficiency of the random-order enumeration algorithms,
based on the master/slave paradigm, we present a parallelization with
1.5-optimal enumeration delay and running time, along with the theoretical

types. We fully characterize linear layers invariant to such permutations. We
verify experimentally that implementing these layers in graph neural network
architectures allows learning important node interactions more effectively than
existing techniques. We show that the dimension of space of these layers is
given by a generalization of Bell numbers, extending the work (Maron et al.,

question about the sizes of tensor layers necessary for function approximation
on graph data. Our findings suggest that function approximation on a graph with
$n$ nodes can be done with tensors of sizes $\leq n$, which is tighter than the
best-known bound $\leq n(n-1)/2$. For $d \times d$ image data with translation

Research suggests that neural responses assessed with electroencephalography

neural tracking (NT) of the attended speech. NT methods mostly rely on
hand-engineered acoustic and linguistic speech features to predict the neural
response. Only recently, deep neural network (DNN) models without specific
linguistic information have been used to extract speech features for NT,
demonstrating that speech features in hierarchical DNN layers can predict
neural responses throughout the auditory pathway. In this study, we go one step
further to investigate the suitability of similar DNN models for speech to
predict neural responses to competing speech observed in EEG. We recorded EEG
data using a 64-channel acquisition system from 17 listeners with normal
hearing instructed to attend to one of two competing talkers. Our data revealed
that EEG responses are significantly better predicted by DNN-extracted speech
features than by hand-engineered acoustic features. Furthermore, analysis of
hierarchical DNN layers showed that early layers yielded the highest
predictions. Moreover, we found a significant increase in auditory attention
classification accuracies with the use of DNN-extracted speech features over
the use of hand-engineered acoustic features. These findings open a new avenue
for development of new NT measures to evaluate and further advance hearing
technology.

  Quantum Computers","65+11 pages, 3 Figures",,,,"quant-ph cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Over the years, the framework of Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) has
been extremely useful for designing a plethora of quantum algorithms. In this
work, we explore whether this widely applicable paradigm can be implemented on
quantum computers that will be available immediately after the current NISQ
stage. To this end, we develop three variants of LCU and apply each, to quantum
algorithms of practical interest.
  First, we develop a physically motivated, continuous-time analogue of LCU
(``Analog LCU''). This technique, implementable on hybrid qubit-qumode systems,
is simpler than its discrete-time counterpart. We use this method to develop
analog quantum algorithms for ground state preparation and quantum linear
systems. We also develop a randomized quantum algorithm to sample from
functions of Hamiltonians applied to quantum states (``Single-Ancilla LCU'').
This approach repeatedly samples from a short-depth quantum circuit and uses
only a single ancilla qubit. We use this to estimate expectation values of
observables in the ground states of a Hamiltonian, and in the solution of
quantum linear systems. This method is suitable for early fault-tolerant
quantum computers. Our third approach stems from the observation that for
several applications, it suffices to replace LCU with randomized sampling of
unitaries according to the distribution of the LCU coefficients (``Ancilla-free
LCU''). This is particularly useful when one is interested in the projection of
a quantum state implemented by an LCU procedure in some subspace of interest.
We demonstrate that this technique applies to the spatial search problem and
helps establish a relationship between discrete and continuous-time quantum
walks with their classical counterparts. Our work demonstrates that generic
quantum algorithmic paradigms, such as LCU, can potentially be implemented on
intermediate-term quantum devices.

half-integer quantization of topological Thouless pump and the anomalous
dynamics of chiral displacement. Moreover, we investigate the evolution of 1D
chiral anomaly with respect to two typical types of disorder, i.e., on-site
disorder and bond disorder. The results show that the on-site disorder tends to
smear the gapless Dirac cone. However, we propose a strategy to stabilize the
half-integer quantization, facilitating its experimental detection.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the bond disorder causes a unique crossover
with disorder-enhanced topological charge pumping, driving the system into a
topological Anderson insulator phase.

methods utilizing sparsification or others can largely lower the communication

propose a novel method, named single-step synthetic features compressor (3SFC),
to achieve communication-efficient FL by directly constructing a tiny synthetic

compression rate when the constructed dataset contains only one data sample.
Moreover, 3SFC's compressing phase utilizes a similarity-based objective
function so that it can be optimized with just one step, thereby considerably
improving its performance and robustness. In addition, to minimize the
compressing error, error feedback (EF) is also incorporated into 3SFC.
Experiments on multiple datasets and models suggest that 3SFC owns
significantly better convergence rates compared to competing methods with lower
compression rates (up to 0.02%). Furthermore, ablation studies and

  Jaegul Choo, Edward Choi","Deep Imbalanced Time-series Forecasting via Local Discrepancy Density",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Time-series forecasting models often encounter abrupt changes in a given
period of time which generally occur due to unexpected or unknown events.
Despite their scarce occurrences in the training set, abrupt changes incur loss
that significantly contributes to the total loss. Therefore, they act as noisy
training samples and prevent the model from learning generalizable patterns,
namely the normal states. Based on our findings, we propose a reweighting
framework that down-weights the losses incurred by abrupt changes and
up-weights those by normal states. For the reweighting framework, we first
define a measurement termed Local Discrepancy (LD) which measures the degree of
abruptness of a change in a given period of time. Since a training set is
mostly composed of normal states, we then consider how frequently the temporal
changes appear in the training set based on LD. Our reweighting framework is
applicable to existing time-series forecasting models regardless of the
architectures. Through extensive experiments on 12 time-series forecasting
models over eight datasets with various in-output sequence lengths, we
demonstrate that applying our reweighting framework reduces MSE by 10.1% on
average and by up to 18.6% in the state-of-the-art model.

  Convolution Network",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Humans can accurately determine whether the object in hand has slipped or not
by visual and tactile perception. However, it is still a challenge for robots
to detect in-hand object slip through visuo-tactile fusion. To address this
issue, a novel visuo-tactile fusion deep neural network is proposed to detect
slip, which is a time-dependent continuous action. By using the multi-scale
temporal convolution network (MS-TCN) to extract the temporal features of
visual and tactile data, the slip can be detected effectively. In this paper, a
7-dregree-of-freedom (7-DoF) robot manipulator equipped with a camera and a
tactile sensor is used for data collection on 50 daily objects with different
shapes, materials, sizes, and weights. Therefore, a dataset is built, where the
grasping data of 40 objects and 10 objects are used for network training and
testing, respectively. The detection accuracy is 96.96% based on the proposed
model. Also, the proposed model is compared with a visuo-tactile fusion deep
neural network (DNN) based on long short-term memory network (LSTM) on the
collected dataset and a public dataset using the GelSight tactile sensor. The
results demonstrate that the proposed model performs better on both dataset.
The proposed model can help robots grasp daily objects reliably. In addition,
it can be used in grasping force control, grasping policy generation and
dexterous manipulation.

There is a short
timescale on which enzymes bind to substrate molecules to produce bound
complexes, and a comparatively long timescale on which the complex is
transformed into a product. The rate at which the substrate is converted into
product is characteristically non-linear and is traditionally derived by
applying of singular perturbation theory to the system's governing equations.
Central to this analysis is the assumption that complex formation is
effectively instantaneous on the timescale over which significant substrate
degradation occurs. This prevents many particle-based simulations of
reaction-diffusion systems from accurately modelling enzyme kinetics since they
rely on proximity based reaction conditions that do not correctly model the
fast reactions associated with the complex on the long timescale. In this paper
we derive a new proximity based reaction condition that correctly incorporates
the reactions that occur on the short timescale for a specific enzymatic
system. We present proof of concept particle-based simulations that demonstrate
that non-linear reaction rates typical of enzyme kinetics can be reproduced
without needing to explicitly simulate reactions on the short timescale.

phenomenon, beyond which stress no longer increases with strain at a
sufficiently large deformation. Understanding the behavior of mechanical
responses associated with yielding is a fundamental goal in granular physics,
and other related fields including glassy physics, material sciences,
geophysics, and active matter biophysics. However, despite nearly half a
century of theoretical efforts, the nature of yielding in amorphous solids
remains largely elusive compared to its crystalline counterpart. Here, we
experimentally investigate the mechanical responses of two-dimensional
bidisperse jammed disks subjected to volume-invariant pure shear, focusing on
the behavior of yielding. We show that the microscopic mechanical and
geometrical features of configurations under shear can be characterized by two
critical exponents of weak-force and small-gap distributions originally
proposed for the isotropic jamming transition. We find that the yielding
transition satisfies the condition of marginal mechanical stability through a
scaling relationship between the two exponents, and after yielding global
instability emerges. The criticality of yielding is revealed by a significant
peak of susceptibility that quantifies the fluctuation of a glass overlap order
parameter. Moreover, we find a distinct transition before yielding, which is
associated with the onset of structural anisotropy.

the residual instrumental noise from the foreground-cleaned map, inspired by
the needlet internal linear combination method, we divide the whole data set
into two ``half-split maps,'' which share the same sky signal, but have
uncorrelated noise, and perform a cross-correlation technique to reduce the
instrumental noise effects at the power spectrum level. We find that the CMB EE

As expected, various foregrounds are cleanly removed from the Planck

assumption of locally plane wavefronts over antenna arrays. This is known as
the far-field approximation and is soundly justified at sub-6-GHz frequencies
at most relevant transmission ranges. However, when higher frequencies and
shorter transmission ranges are used, the wave curvature over the array is no
longer negligible, and arrays operate in the so-called radiative near-field
region. This letter aims to show that the classical far-field approximation may
significantly underestimate the achievable spectral efficiency of multi-user
MIMO communications operating in the 30-GHz bands and above, even at ranges
beyond the Fraunhofer distance. For planar arrays with typical sizes, we show
that computing combining schemes based on the far-field model significantly
reduces the channel gain and spatial multiplexing capability. When the
radiative near-field model is used, interference rejection schemes, such as the
optimal minimum mean-square-error combiner, appear to be very promising, when

novel generation paradigm and has achieved promising results in machine

modules: datastore, retriever and combiner, thus putting diverse kNN generation
methods into a unified way. Currently, kNN-BOX has provided implementation of
seven popular kNN-MT variants, covering research from performance enhancement
to efficiency optimization. It is easy for users to reproduce these existing
works or customize their own models. Besides, users can interact with their kNN
generation systems with kNN-BOX to better understand the underlying inference
process in a visualized way. In the experiment section, we apply kNN-BOX for
machine translation and three other seq2seq generation tasks, namely, text
simplification, paraphrase generation and question generation. Experiment
results show that augmenting the base neural model with kNN-BOX leads to a
large performance improvement in all these tasks. The code and document of
kNN-BOX is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/knn-box.

into the accretion process around a black hole. In this work, thanks to the
broadband spectra coverage of \emph{the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array},
we study the spectral properties for a sample of low-mass black hole X-ray

photon index $\Gamma$ and the reflection fraction $R$ (the ratio of the coronal
intensity that illuminates the disk to the coronal intensity that reaches the
observer), consistent with previous studies, but except for MAXI J1820+070. It
is quite interesting that this source also deviates from the well-known
``V""-shaped correlation between the photon index $\Gamma$ and the X-ray
luminosity log$L_{\rm X}$, when it is in the bright hard state. More
specifically, the $\Lambda$-shaped correlation between $\Gamma$ and log$L_{\rm
X}$ is observed, as the luminosity decreases by a factor of 3 in a narrow range
from $\sim 10^{38}$ to $10^{37.5}$ $\rm erg~s^{-1}$. Furthermore, we discover a
strong positive correlation between $R$ and the X-ray luminosity for BHXRBs in
the hard state, which puts a constraint on the disk-corona coupling and the

However, with the vehicle's veering, the constant rotation of the surrounding
scenario makes a challenge for the perception systems. Yet most existing
methods have not focused on alleviating the detection accuracy impairment
brought by the vehicle's rotation, especially in outdoor 3D detection. In this
paper, we propose DuEqNet, which first introduces the concept of equivariance
into 3D object detection network by leveraging a hierarchical embedded
framework. The dual-equivariance of our model can extract the equivariant
features at both local and global levels, respectively. For the local feature,
we utilize the graph-based strategy to guarantee the equivariance of the
feature in point cloud pillars. In terms of the global feature, the group
equivariant convolution layers are adopted to aggregate the local feature to
achieve the global equivariance. In the experiment part, we evaluate our
approach with different baselines in 3D object detection tasks and obtain
State-Of-The-Art performance. According to the results, our model presents
higher accuracy on orientation and better prediction efficiency. Moreover, our
dual-equivariance strategy exhibits the satisfied plug-and-play ability on
various popular object detection frameworks to improve their performance.

represents a challenge when deploying in partly unknown environments like in
the case of ADAS. At the same time, the standard confidence of DNNs remains
high even if the classification reliability decreases. This is problematic
since following motion control algorithms consider the apparently confident
prediction as reliable even though it might be considerably wrong. To reduce
this problem real-time capable confidence estimation is required that better
aligns with the actual reliability of the DNN classification. Additionally, the
need exists for black-box confidence estimation to enable the homogeneous
inclusion of externally developed components to an entire system. In this work
we explore this use case and introduce the neighborhood confidence (NHC) which
estimates the confidence of an arbitrary DNN for classification. The metric can
be used for black-box systems since only the top-1 class output is required and
does not need access to the gradients, the training dataset or a hold-out

that the NHC performs better or on par with a comparable method for online

semantic communications. This paper proposes a deep separate source-channel
coding (DSSCC) framework for the joint task and data oriented semantic

solve the rate-distortion problem with semantic distortion. First, by analyzing
the Bayesian model of the DSSCC framework, we derive a novel rate-distortion
optimization problem via the Bayesian inference approach for general data
distributions and semantic tasks. Next, for a typical application of joint
image transmission and classification, we combine the variational autoencoder
approach with a forward adaption scheme to effectively extract image features
and adaptively learn the density information of the obtained features. Finally,
an iterative training algorithm is proposed to tackle the overfitting issue of
deep learning models. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme
achieves better coding gain as well as data recovery and classification
performance in most scenarios, compared to the classical compression schemes

displacement of multiple particle groups leads to rapid increase of
computational requirements. MODPATH is a particle tracking engine for MODFLOW
models and source code displays potential for parallel processing of particles.
This article addresses the implementation of this feature with the OpenMP
library. Two synthetic aquifer applications are employed for performance tests
on a desktop computer with increasing number of particles. Speed up analysis
shows that dynamic thread scheduling is preferable for highly heterogeneous
flows, providing processing adaptivity to the presence of slow particles. In
simulations writing particles position in time, thread exclusive output files
lead to higher speed up factors. Results show that above a threshold number of

applications with little or no supervised information and subtle anomalies such
as hardly visible brain lesions. Among unsupervised methods, patch-based
auto-encoders with their efficient representation power provided by their
latent space, have shown good results for visible lesion detection. However,
the commonly used reconstruction error criterion may limit their performance
when facing less obvious lesions. In this work, we design two alternative
detection criteria. They are derived from multivariate analysis and can more
directly capture information from latent space representations. Their
performance compares favorably with two additional supervised learning methods,
on a difficult de novo Parkinson Disease (PD) classification task.

In a geometric representation of a hypergraph $H=(V,E)$, each vertex $v\in V$
is a associated with a point $p_v\in \mathbb{R}^d$ and each hyperedge $e\in E$
is associated with a connected set $s_e\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ such that
$\{p_v\mid v\in V\}\cap s_e=\{p_v\mid v\in e\}$ for all $e\in E$. We say that a
given hypergraph $H$ is representable by some (infinite) family $\mathcal{F}$
of sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, if there exist $P\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $S
\subseteq \mathcal{F}$ such that $(P,S)$ is a geometric representation of $H$.
For a family $\mathcal{F}$, we define RECOGNITION($\mathcal{F}$) as the problem
to determine if a given hypergraph is representable by $\mathcal{F}$. It is
known that the RECOGNITION problem is ER-hard for halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
We study the families of balls and ellipsoids in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as well as
other convex sets, and show that their RECOGNITION problems are also
ER-complete. This means that these recognition problems are equivalent to
deciding whether a multivariate system of polynomial equations with integer
coefficients has a real solution.

performance in image denoising by exploiting the self-attention (SA) in images.
However, the existing methods mostly use a relatively small window to compute
SA due to the quadratic complexity of it, which limits the model's ability to
model long-term image information. In this paper, we propose the
spatial-frequency attention network (SFANet) to enhance the network's ability
in exploiting long-range dependency. For spatial attention module (SAM), we
adopt dilated SA to model long-range dependency. In the frequency attention
module (FAM), we exploit more global information by using Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) by designing a window-based frequency channel attention (WFCA)
block to effectively model deep frequency features and their dependencies. To
make our module applicable to images of different sizes and keep the model
consistency between training and inference, we apply window-based FFT with a
set of fixed window sizes. In addition, channel attention is computed on both
real and imaginary parts of the Fourier spectrum, which further improves
restoration performance. The proposed WFCA block can effectively model image
long-range dependency with acceptable complexity. Experiments on multiple
denoising benchmarks demonstrate the leading performance of SFANet network.

that fosters the development of algorithms for pose estimation and mapping.
Inspired by the need for real-life deployment of autonomous robots in such
environments, this article presents an experimental comparative study of 3D
SLAM algorithms. The study focuses on state-of-the-art Lidar SLAM algorithms
with open-source implementation that are i) lidar-only like BLAM, LOAM, A-LOAM,
ISC-LOAM and hdl graph slam, or ii) lidar-inertial like LeGO-LOAM,
Cartographer, LIO-mapping and LIO-SAM. The evaluation of the methods is
performed based on a dataset collected from the Boston Dynamics Spot robot
equipped with 3D lidar Velodyne Puck Lite and IMU Vectornav VN-100, during a
mission in an underground tunnel. In the evaluation process poses and 3D tunnel
reconstructions from SLAM algorithms are compared against each other to find
methods with most solid performance in terms of pose accuracy and map quality.

thus enhancing the potential for scientific discovery with the wealth of data

to adapt the data of the MAGIC telescopes to the standardised format proposed
by the Data Formats for Gamma-ray Astronomy initiative. We validate the data
conversion by analysing the standardised data with the open-source software
Gammapy and comparing the results obtained against those produced with the

solved by the QPAS method that is warm-started with a working set and the

quark-gluon plasma (QGP) to reproduce data on the elliptic flow of particles in
relativistic collisions of $^{238}$U nuclei at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion
Collider (RHIC). We demonstrate that this failure is caused by an inappropriate
implementation of well-deformed ions, such as $^{238}$U, in the hydrodynamic
framework. Past studies have identified the deformation of the nuclear surface
with that of the nuclear volume, though these are different concepts. In
particular, a volume quadrupole moment can be generated by both a surface
hexadecapole and a surface quadrupole moment. This feature was so far neglected
in the modeling of heavy-ion collisions, and is particularly relevant for
nuclei like $^{238}$U, which is both quadrupole- and hexadecapole-deformed.
With rigorous input from Skyrme density functional calculations, we show that
correcting for such effects in the implementation of nuclear deformations in
hydrodynamic simulations restores agreement with BNL RHIC data. This brings
consistency to the results of nuclear experiments across energy scales, and
demonstrates the impact of the hexadecapole deformation of $^{238}$U on
high-energy collisions.

Siberia). Unfortunately the first expedition was made by Kulik 19 years after
the event and macroscopic meteorites have never been found in epicenter site.
After considering the Chelyabinsk event as a guide, because it is the most
energetic impact event observed after TE, we estimated the strewn field of
possible macroscopic fragments of the asteroid responsible of the TE: we have
reason to believe that there might be fragments with enough strength to survive
the airburst and reach the ground. The strewn field, which is located about 16

macroscopic bodies, even if the mud and vegetation could have made any trace

falls several km outside these areas and, based on our results, it is unlikely
that it could be a real impact crater: only if the cosmic body's trajectory had

systematically as functions of polymer concentration and binding energy between

regardless of binding energy at sufficiently high concentration. However, the
contribution to the stress sustained by this physical network can decay faster
than other relaxation processes, even single chain relaxations. If the polymer
relaxation time scales overlap with short-lived associations, the mechanical
response of a gel becomes ""evanescent"", decaying before it can be rheologically
observed, even though the network is instantaneously mechanically rigid. In our
simulations, the concentration of elastically active chains and the dynamic
modulii are computed independently. This makes it possible to combine
structural and rheological information to identify the concentration at which
the sol-gel transition occurs as a function of binding energy. Further, it is
shown that the competition of scales between the dissociation time and the

coronal counterparts, including the classical ``white-light prominence'' (WLP)
phenomenon. Aims: Coronal emissions by flares, seen in white-light continuum,
have only rarely been reported previously. We seek to use modern data to
understand the morphology of WLP events. Methods: We have identified a set of
14 examples of WLP detected by the HMI (Heliospheric and Magnetic Imager)
experiment on board SDO (the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite), using a new
on-line catalogue covering 2011-2017. These invariably accompanied white-light
flares (WLF) emission from the lower atmosphere by flares near the limb, as
identified by hard X-ray images from RHESSI (the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
Spectroscopic Imager). HMI provides full Stokes information, and we have used
the linear polarisations (Q~and~U) to distinguish Thomson scattering from cool
material. Results: The event morphologies fit roughly into three categories:
Ejection, Loop, and Spike, but many events show multiple phenomena.
Conclusions: The coronal white-light continuum, observed by HMI analogously to
the observations made by a coronagraph, detects many examples of coronal
emission and dynamics. Using the Stokes linear polarisation, we estimate the
masses of hot coronal plasma in 11 of the 14 events and find them to be similar
to typical CME masses, but not exceeding 10$^{15}$\,g. We note that the HMI
observations do not occult the bright solar disk and were not designed for
coronal observations, resulting in relatively low signal-to-noise ratios. We
therefore believe that future such observations with better optimisation will

exist at zero external pressure relative to neutron. We note that a maximum

planner with the selfish interests of the agents involved in these protocols is
of paramount importance in almost every decentralized setting (such as,
computer networks, markets, etc.) as shown by the rich literature in Mechanism
Design. Recently, huge interest has been devoted to the design of mechanisms
for imperfectly rational agents, i.e., mechanisms for which agents are able to
easily grasp that there is no action different from following the protocol that
would satisfy their interests better. This work has culminated in the
definition of Obviously Strategyproof (OSP) Mechanisms, that have been shown to
capture the incentives of agents without contingent reasoning skills.
  Without an understanding of the algorithmic nature of OSP mechanisms, it is
hard to assess how well these mechanisms can satisfy the goals of the planner.
For the case of binary allocation problems and agents whose private type is a
single number, recent work has shown that a generalization of greedy completely
characterizes OSP. In this work, we strengthen the connection between greedy
and OSP by providing a characterization of OSP mechanisms for all optimization
problems involving these single-parameter agents. Specifically, we prove that
OSP mechanisms must essentially work as follows: they either greedily look for
agents with ``better'' types and allocate them larger outcomes; or reverse
greedily look for agents with ``worse'' types and allocate them smaller
outcomes; or, finally, split the domain of agents in ``good'' and ``bad''
types, and subsequently proceed in a reverse greedy fashion for the former and
greedily for the latter. We further demonstrate how to use this
characterization to give bounds on the approximation guarantee of OSP
mechanisms for the well known scheduling related machines problem.

pause insertion frameworks based on a pre-trained language model. Our approach
uses bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) pre-trained

The first improves conventional phrasing models on the position prediction of

information on the prediction. The second model is further designed for
phoneme-based TTS models and performs duration-aware pause insertion,
predicting both RPs and punctuation-indicated pauses (PIPs) that are

asymptotically converges to a unique equilibrium, as a function of this action.
The dynamics of the system are unknown to the decision-maker, which can only
observe a noisy reward at the end of every turn. The decision-maker wants to
maximize its accumulated reward over the $T$ turns. Learning what equilibria
are better results in higher rewards, but waiting for the system to converge to
equilibrium costs valuable time. Existing bandit algorithms, either stochastic
or adversarial, achieve linear (trivial) regret for this problem. We present a
novel algorithm, termed Upper Equilibrium Concentration Bound (UECB), that
knows to switch an action quickly if it is not worth it to wait until the

determine how far the system is from equilibrium. We prove that UECB achieves a
regret of $\mathcal{O}(\log(T)+\tau_c\log(\tau_c)+\tau_c\log\log(T))$ for this
equilibrium bandit problem where $\tau_c$ is the worst case approximate
convergence time to equilibrium. We then show that both epidemic control and

degree of irrationality. This classification is performed in three steps: (1)
select a benchmark of rationality, for which this degree is zero; (2) endow the
set of choices with a metric to measure deviations from rationality; and (3)
compute the distance of any choice behavior from the selected benchmark. The
natural candidate for step 1 is the family of all rationalizable behaviors. A
possible candidate for step 2 is a suitable variation of the metric described
by Klamler (2008), which displays a sharp discerning power among different
types of choice behaviors. In step 3 we use this new metric to establish the
minimum distance of any choice behavior from the benchmark of rationality.
Finally we describe a measure of stochastic irrationality, which employs the
random utility model as a benchmark of rationality, and the Block-Marschak
polynomials to measure deviations from it.

  adjoints",,,,,"math.CO cs.DM math.CT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  This paper describes several cases of adjunction in the homomorphism order of
relational structures. For these purposes, we say that two functors $\Gamma$
and $\Delta$ between categories of relational structures are adjoint if for all
structures $A$ and $B$, we have that $\Gamma(A)$ maps homomorphically to $B$ if
and only if $A$ maps homomorphically to $\Delta(B)$. If this is the case
$\Gamma$ is called the left adjoint to $\Delta$ and $\Delta$ the right adjoint
to $\Gamma$.
  In 2015, Foniok and Tardif described some functors category of digraphs that
allow both left and right adjoints. The main contribution of Foniok and Tardif
is a construction of right adjoints to some of the functors identified as right
adjoints by Pultr in 1970. We generalise results of Foniok and Tardif to
arbitrary relational relational structures, and coincidentely, we also provide
more right adjoints on digraphs, and since these constructions are connected to
finite duality, we also provide a new construction of duals to trees.
  Our results are motivated by the application in promise constraint
satisfaction -- it has been shown that such functors can be used as efficient
reductions between these problems.

procedure based on high-frequency data. Unlike usual high-dimensional
regression procedure such as LASSO, we additionally handle the heavy-tailedness
of high-frequency observations as well as time variations of coefficient
processes. Specifically, we employ Huber loss and truncation scheme to handle
heavy-tailed observations, while $\ell_{1}$-regularization is adopted to
overcome the curse of dimensionality under a sparse coefficient structure. To
account for the time-varying coefficient, we estimate local high-dimensional
coefficients which are biased estimators due to the $\ell_{1}$-regularization.
Thus, when estimating integrated coefficients, we propose a debiasing scheme to
enjoy the law of large number property and employ a thresholding scheme to
further accommodate the sparsity of the coefficients. We call this Robust
thrEsholding Debiased LASSO (RED-LASSO) estimator. We show that the RED-LASSO
estimator can achieve a near-optimal convergence rate with only finite
$\gamma$th moment for any $\gamma>2$. In the empirical study, we apply the
RED-LASSO procedure to the high-dimensional integrated coefficient estimation
using high-frequency trading data.

behaviors: for phase-separated states at $T=0$, thermal effects induce a
diffusion process which reduces the local imbalance whereas, for miscible

certain temperature, below the critical one. We show that this intriguing

Bose-Einstein statistics of the particles in the mixture and to an unexpected

performing advanced polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission

MoSe2 are weak topological insulators (WTIs), whereas 2M-WS2 is a strong

transitions by tunning interlayer distance indicates that band inversion

source located on the Galactic plane. While it has been connected to the nebula
of the energetic pulsar PSR J1809$-$1917, supernova remnants and molecular
clouds present in the vicinity also constitute possible associations. Recently,
the detection of $\gamma$-ray emission up to energies of $\sim$100 TeV with the
HAWC observatory has led to renewed interest in HESS J1809$-$193.
  Aims. We aim to understand the origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission of HESS
J1809$-$193.
  Methods. We analysed 93.2 h of data taken on HESS J1809$-$193 above 0.27 TeV
with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), using a multi-component,
three-dimensional likelihood analysis. In addition, we provide a new analysis
of 12.5 yr of Fermi-LAT data above 1 GeV within the region of HESS J1809$-$193.
The obtained results are interpreted in a time-dependent modelling framework.
  Results. For the first time, we were able to resolve the emission detected
with H.E.S.S. into two components: an extended component that exhibits a
spectral cut-off at $\sim$13 TeV, and a compact component that is located close
to PSR J1809$-$1917 and shows no clear spectral cut-off. The Fermi-LAT analysis
also revealed extended $\gamma$-ray emission, on scales similar to that of the
extended H.E.S.S. component.
  Conclusions. Our modelling indicates that based on its spectrum and spatial
extent, the extended H.E.S.S. component is likely caused by inverse Compton
emission from old electrons that form a halo around the pulsar wind nebula. The
compact component could be connected to either the pulsar wind nebula or the
supernova remnant and molecular clouds. Due to its comparatively steep
spectrum, modelling the Fermi-LAT emission together with the H.E.S.S.
components is not straightforward. (abridged)

Fine-grained video-text communication is done by additional cross-modal

constraints of the hosting satellite. This paper investigates the attainable
performance of large distributed arrays of antennas implemented as the ensemble
of a few to many simpler sub-antennas of smaller sizes, carried by one (small)
satellite each. The sub-antennas can in their turn be implemented like
(regular) 2D arrays of simple radiating elements, realizing an overall
(distributed) antenna architecture that we call ""Formation of Arrays"" (FoA).
The satellites that implement this radiating architecture need to be relatively
close to each other and constitute a formation of flying objects, to be
coordinated and controlled as a whole. In this paper, we develop a theoretical
analysis of an FoA antenna, and we show how to take advantage of this new
technology to improve network throughput in a multi-beam S-band mobile
communication network with low-earth or geostationary orbiting satellites
directly providing 5G-like communication services to hand-held user terminals.

Markov decision processes (MDPs) and integer-weighted MDPs with finite state
space. Specifically, it considers problems addressing termination probabilities
and expected termination times for one-counter MDPs, as well as satisfaction
probabilities of energy objectives, conditional and partial expectations,
satisfaction probabilities of constraints on the total accumulated weight, the
computation of quantiles for the accumulated weight, and the conditional
value-at-risk for accumulated weights for integer-weighted MDPs. Although
algorithmic results are available for some special instances, the decidability
status of the decision versions of these problems is unknown in general.
  The paper demonstrates that these optimization problems are inherently
mathematically difficult by providing polynomial-time reductions from the
Positivity problem for linear recurrence sequences. This problem is a
well-known number-theoretic problem whose decidability status has been open for
decades and it is known that decidability of the Positivity problem would have
far-reaching consequences in analytic number theory. So, the reductions
presented in the paper show that an algorithmic solution to any of the
investigated problems is not possible without a major breakthrough in analytic
number theory.
  The reductions rely on the construction of MDP-gadgets that encode the
initial values and linear recurrence relations of linear recurrence sequences.
Interestingly, the reductions can also be extended to demonstrate the
Positivity-hardness of two problems that address the long-run behavior of a
system, namely the model-checking problem of frequency-LTL and the optimization
of the long-run average probability to satisfy a path property. Both of these
problems have been studied before on special instances, but are open in
general.

by means of dust formation modelling where dust grains form and grow in a
static wind and expand from the surface of the star. The method is applied to
various evolutionary stages of the final AGB phase of stars with different
masses and metallicities. The detailed analysis of the SED of the sources
investigated, which included the derivation of the luminosities and the dust
properties, is used to infer information on mass loss, efficiency of dust
formation, and wind dynamics. We confirm previous results that most of the
investigated sources descend from low-mass(M<1.5Msun) progenitors that reached
the C-star stage. Metal-poor carbon stars are characterised by higher IR
excesses with respect to their more metal-rich counterparts of similar
luminosity due to a higher surface carbon-to-oxygen excess. This work confirms
previous conclusions that more luminous stars descending from higher-mass
progenitors are generally more opaque due to shorter evolutionary timescales
that place the dust shell closer to the central object. We also find that the
mass-loss rate at the tip of the AGB phase of metal-rich low-mass carbon stars
is approximately 1-1.5x10^-5Msun/yr, whereas in the metal-poor domain
M~4-5x10^-5Msun/yr is required. These results indicate the need for an upwards

otherwise well-established among VC tasks, which has been shown to improve our
model's SVC performance. We first trained a singer identity embedding (SIE)
network on mel-spectrograms of singer recordings to produce singer-specific
variance encodings using contrastive learning. We subsequently trained a
well-known autoencoder framework (AutoVC) conditioned on these SIEs, and
measured differences in SVC performance when using different latent regressor
loss components. We found that using this loss w.r.t. SIEs leads to better
performance than w.r.t. bottleneck embeddings, where converted audio is more
natural and specific towards target singers. The inclusion of this loss
component has the advantage of explicitly forcing the network to reconstruct
with timbral similarity, and also negates the effect of poor disentanglement in
AutoVC's bottleneck embeddings. We demonstrate peculiar diversity between
computational and human evaluations on singer-converted audio clips, which
highlights the necessity of both. We also propose a pitch-matching mechanism
between source and target singers to ensure these evaluations are not

phenomena, ranging from glassy dynamics and metamaterials to climate models.
The Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) provides a rigorous way to describe
memory effects via the so-called memory kernel in an integro-differential
equation. However, the memory kernel is often unknown, and accurately
predicting or measuring it via e.g. a numerical inverse Laplace transform
remains a herculean task. Here we describe a novel method using deep neural
networks (DNNs) to measure memory kernels from dynamical data. As
proof-of-principle, we focus on the notoriously long-lived memory effects of
glassy systems, which have proved a major challenge to existing methods.
Specifically, we learn a training set generated with the Mode-Coupling Theory
(MCT) of hard spheres. Our DNNs are remarkably robust against noise, in
contrast to conventional techniques which require ensemble averaging over many
independent trajectories. Finally, we demonstrate that a network trained on
data generated from analytic theory (hard-sphere MCT) generalises well to data
from simulations of a different system (Brownian Weeks-Chandler-Andersen
particles). We provide a general pipeline, KernelLearner, for training networks
to extract memory kernels from any non-Markovian system described by a GLE. The
success of our DNN method applied to glassy systems suggests deep learning can
play an important role in the study of dynamical systems that exhibit memory
effects.

a method that quickly generates robust precision grasps using the min-weight

interpretable, provides a reasonable measure of grasp robustness, and admits
numerically efficient gradients for smooth optimization. We leverage these

in a wide range of systems, from the cellular level to geographical
lengthscales. In this paper, we revisit the archetypical example of such a
system: a collection of small passive particles immersed in a dilute suspension
of non-interacting dipolar microswimmers, representing bacteria or algae. In
particular, we consider the interplay between thermal (Brownian) diffusion and
hydrodynamic (active) diffusion due to the persistent advection of tracers by
microswimmer flow fields. Previously, it has been argued that even a moderate
amount of Brownian diffusion is sufficient to significantly reduce the
persistence time of tracer advection, leading to a significantly reduced value
of the effective active diffusion coefficient $D_A$ compared to the
non-Brownian case. Here, we show by large-scale simulations and kinetic theory
that this effect is in fact only practically relevant for microswimmers that
effectively remain stationary while still stirring up the surrounding fluid,
so-called \emph{shakers}. In contrast, for moderate and high values of the
swimming speed $v_s$, relevant for biological microswimmer suspensions, the
effect of Brownian motion on $D_A$ is negligible, leading to the effects of
advection by microswimmers and Brownian motion being additive. This conclusion
contrasts with previous results from the literature, and encourages a
reinterpretation of recent experimental measurements of $D_A$ for tracer
particles of varying size in bacterial suspensions.

pipe wall and the unperturbed interface (of a constant curvature, e.g., plane
interface, as considered in this work) coincide with the coordinate surfaces.
Thereby, the no-slip as well as the interfacial boundary conditions can be
imposed easily. It also enables investigation of the local behavior of the flow

symmetry-protected topological phase, deconfinement phase, etc. We find that
the MoC constructed by the guiding principle reproduces phase diagram very
similar to that of the ground state of the gauge-Higgs Hamiltonian. The present
work indicates that the MoC can be broadly used to produce interesting phases

predicting molecular properties, which is one of the most classical
cheminformatics tasks with various applications. Despite their effectiveness,
we empirically observe that training a single GNN model for diverse molecules
with distinct structural patterns limits its prediction performance. In this
paper, motivated by this observation, we propose TopExpert to leverage
topology-specific prediction models (referred to as experts), each of which is
responsible for each molecular group sharing similar topological semantics.
That is, each expert learns topology-specific discriminative features while
being trained with its corresponding topological group. To tackle the key
challenge of grouping molecules by their topological patterns, we introduce a
clustering-based gating module that assigns an input molecule into one of the
clusters and further optimizes the gating module with two different types of
self-supervision: topological semantics induced by GNNs and molecular
scaffolds, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TopExpert has
boosted the performance for molecular property prediction and also achieved
better generalization for new molecules with unseen scaffolds than baselines.

deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation seems significantly underdeveloped.
A potential reason for this is the inherent difficulty in describing and

This paper proposes an algorithm for fast-tracking the shape of a DLO based on
the masked image. Having no prior knowledge about the tracked object, the
proposed method finds a reliable representation of the shape of the tracked
object within tens of milliseconds. This algorithm's main idea is to first
skeletonize the DLO mask image, walk through the parts of the DLO skeleton,
arrange the segments into an ordered path, and finally fit a B-spline into it.
Experiments show that our solution outperforms the State-of-the-Art approaches
in DLO's shape reconstruction accuracy and algorithm running time and can
handle challenging scenarios such as severe occlusions, self-intersections, and
multiple DLOs in a single image.

By solving inner standard MDPs for pseudo mean-variance optimization, we can
identify worse policy spaces dominated by optimal policies of the pseudo

to be an important criterion in designing codewords for DNA computing purposes,
namely secondary structure avoidance in single-stranded DNA molecules. In
short, secondary structure refers to the tendency of a single-stranded DNA
sequence to fold back upon itself, thus becoming inactive in the computation
process. While some design criteria that reduces the possibility of secondary
structure formation has been proposed by Milenkovic and Kashyap (2006), the
main contribution of this work is to provide an explicit construction of DNA
codes that completely avoid secondary structure of arbitrary stem length.
Formally, given codeword length n and arbitrary integer m>=2, we provide
efficient methods to construct DNA codes of length n that avoid secondary
structure of any stem length more than or equal to m. Particularly, when m = 3,
our constructions yield a family of DNA codes of rate 1.3031 bits/nt, while the
highest rate found in the prior art was 1.1609 bits/nt. In addition, for
m>=3log n + 4, we provide an efficient encoder that incurs only one redundant
symbol.

resurgence methods and Borel-summed gauge field propagators. At 2-loop, to
order $1/N_f$, we construct the full 2-parameter transseries and perform the
sum over the non-perturbative sectors. We then introduce a convolution-based
method to derive the transseries structure of product series, which can also be
used to study higher orders in the expansion in $1/N_f$. We compute 3-loop
planar diagrams, at order $1/N_f^2$, and for each diagram study the asymptotic
behavior and resulting non-perturbative information in the transseries. A
structure emerges that, from a resurgence point of view, is quite different
from toy models hitherto studied. We study in particular the first and second
non-perturbative sectors, their relation to UV and IR renormalons, and how
their presence influences the perturbative expansions in neighbouring sectors.
Finally, finding that many non-perturbative sectors have asymptotic series, we
derive relations among all of them, thus providing an interesting new
perspective on the alien lattice for the Adler function.

report their preferences to ensure efficiency and fairness. Our research paper
analyzes the factors that contribute to and the consequences of students
reporting non-truthfully in admissions applications. We survey college
applicants in Denmark about their perceptions of the admission process and
personality to examine recent theories of misreporting preferences. Our
analysis reveals that omissions in reports are largely driven by students'
pessimistic beliefs about their chances of admission. Moreover, such erroneous
beliefs largely account for whether an omission led to a missed opportunity for
admission. However, the low frequency of these errors suggests that most
non-truthful reports are ""white lies"" with minimal negative impact. We find a
novel role of personality and individual circumstances that co-determine the
extent of omissions. We also find that estimates of students' demand are biased
if it is assumed that students report truthfully, and demonstrate that this
bias can be reduced by making a less restrictive assumption. Our results have
implications for the modeling of preferences, information acquisition, and

found experimentally under diverse thermodynamic conditions, as well as
surfaces and nanoparticles (NPs). By studying its phase diagram, we show that
our GAP remains stable at extreme conditions, including those found in the
Earth's core. The new GAP is particularly accurate for the description of NPs.
We use it to identify new low-energy NPs, whose stability is verified by
performing density functional theory calculations on the GAP structures. Many
of these NPs are lower in energy than those previously available in the
literature up to $N_\text{atoms}=100$. We further extend the convex hull of
available stable structures to $N_\text{atoms}=200$. For these NPs, we study
characteristic surface atomic motifs using data clustering and low-dimensional
embedding techniques. With a few exceptions, e.g., at magic numbers
$N_\text{atoms}=59$, $65$, $76$ and $78$, we find that iron tends to form
irregularly shaped NPs without a dominant surface character or characteristic
atomic motif, and no reminiscence of crystalline features. We hypothesize that
the observed disorder stems from an intricate balance and competition between
the stable bulk motif formation, with bcc structure, and the stable surface
motif formation, with fcc structure. We expect these results to improve our
understanding of the fundamental properties and structure of low-dimensional
forms of iron, and to facilitate future work in the field of iron-based

innovations. Generating safety-critical scenarios that present significant
challenges to AV is an essential first step in testing. Real-world datasets
include naturalistic but overly safe driving behaviors, whereas simulation

relationship between their sizes and masses. We re-examine the Fornax Cluster
dwarf population from the point of view of isomass-radius--stellar mass
relations (IRSMRs) using the Fornax Deep Survey Dwarf galaxy Catalogue, with
the centrally located (among dwarfs) $3.63 \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$~pc$^{-2}$
isodensity radius defining our fiducial relation. This relation is a powerful
diagnostic tool for identifying dwarfs with unusual structure, as dwarf
galaxies' remarkable monotonicity in light profile shapes, as a function of
stellar mass, reduces the relation's scatter tremendously. By examining how
different dwarf properties (colour, tenth-nearest-neighbour distance, etc.)
correlate with distance from our fiducial relation, we find a significant
population of structural outliers with comparatively lower central mass surface
density and larger half-light-radii, residing in locally denser regions in the
cluster, albeit with similar red colours. We propose that these faint, extended
outliers likely formed through tidal disturbances, which make the dwarfs more
diffuse, but with little mass loss. Comparing these outliers with ultra-diffuse

the Fornax Cluster lie both on and off of IRSMRs defined at small radii, while
IRSMR outliers with masses below $\sim 10^{7.5} \mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ are

remains under debate. Here, after reviewing the mechanisms proposed to explain
the GCS effect, we determine the material and device parameters that mainly
affect a GCS, based on the studies reported to date. Our analysis suggests that
some mechanisms are only relevant for specific experiments, and it reveals the
importance of parameters like structural disorder and surface properties for a
GCS. We also propose studies that can answer the remaining open questions on
the GCS effect, which is key to control such effect for its future
technological applications.

proposed online algorithm is prediction-free and does not need to consider the
time-coupling constraints related to workload queue and battery explicitly,
which is easier to implement. Nonetheless, we prove that the time-coupling

within their physical limits automatically. The previous online algorithms do
not have such a guarantee. We bound the optimality gap between the online and

accelerated ADMM algorithm is developed including the iteration truncation and
the follow-up well-designed adjustments, whereby a nearly optimal solution is
attained with much enhanced computational efficiency. Case studies demonstrate

coreset is a much smaller set $S\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, so that the $k$-Median
costs of any $k$ centers w.r.t. $P$ and $S$ are close. Existing literature
mainly focuses on the high-dimension case and there has been great success in
obtaining dimension-independent bounds, whereas the case for small $d$ is
largely unexplored. Considering many applications of Euclidean clustering
algorithms are in small dimensions and the lack of systematic studies in the
current literature, this paper investigates coresets for $k$-Median in small
dimensions. For small $d$, a natural question is whether existing near-optimal
dimension-independent bounds can be significantly improved. We provide
affirmative answers to this question for a range of parameters. Moreover, new
lower bound results are also proved, which are the highest for small $d$. In
particular, we completely settle the coreset size bound for $1$-d $k$-Median
(up to log factors). Interestingly, our results imply a strong separation
between $1$-d $1$-Median and $1$-d $2$-Median. As far as we know, this is the
first such separation between $k=1$ and $k=2$ in any dimension.

thermal boundary conditions. Our experimental data show an increased
characteristic horizontal extension scale of the flow structures,
$\tilde{\lambda}$, for increasing Ra, which is coupled with a raise of the Biot
number Bi in particular at the cooling plate. However, we find the experimental
flow structure size to range in any case between the ones observed for the
idealized thermal conditions captured by the simulations. On the one hand, they
are larger than in the numerical case with applied uniform temperatures at the
plates, but, on the other hand, smaller than in the case of an applied constant
heat flux, the latter of which leads to a structure that grows gradually up to
the horizontal domain size. We link this observation qualitatively to
theoretical predictions for the onset of convection. Furthermore, we study the
effect of the asymmetric boundary conditions on the heat transfer. Contrasting
experimental and numerical data reveals an increased probability of far-tail
events of reversed heat transfer. The decomposition of the local Nusselt number

the following sense: every Reeh-Schlieder state contains entanglement between
any two spatially separated regions. This applies, in particular, to the vacuum
of a non-interacting scalar theory in Minkowski spacetime. Discussions on
entanglement in field theory have focused mainly on subsystems containing
infinitely many degrees of freedom -- typically, the field modes that are
supported within a compact region of space. In this article, we study
entanglement in subsystems made of finitely many field degrees of freedom, in a
free scalar theory in $D+1$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The focus on
finitely many modes of the field is motivated by the finite capabilities of
real experiments. We find that entanglement between finite-dimensional
subsystems is {\em not common at all}, and that one needs to carefully select
the support of modes for entanglement to show up. We also find that
entanglement is increasingly sparser in higher dimensions. We conclude that
entanglement in Minkowski spacetime is significantly less ubiquitous than
normally thought.

future behavior of the system. A standard approach is training recurrent models
on measurement data. While these models typically provide exact short-term
predictions, accumulating errors yield deteriorated long-term behavior. In
contrast, models with reliable long-term predictions can often be obtained,
either by training a robust but less detailed model, or by leveraging
physics-based simulations. In both cases, inaccuracies in the models yield a
lack of short-time details. Thus, different models with contrastive properties
on different time horizons are available. This observation immediately raises
the question: Can we obtain predictions that combine the best of both worlds?
Inspired by sensor fusion tasks, we interpret the problem in the frequency
domain and leverage classical methods from signal processing, in particular
complementary filters. This filtering technique combines two signals by
applying a high-pass filter to one signal, and low-pass filtering the other.
Essentially, the high-pass filter extracts high-frequencies, whereas the
low-pass filter extracts low frequencies. Applying this concept to dynamics
model learning enables the construction of models that yield accurate long- and

Multi-Feature Integration Model (MFIM) where the examination bias depends on
the representation of document except the rank of it. Furthermore, we mine a

onset of non-classical signatures in the KDQ distribution of work, in the form

realistic DESI fiber assignment simulations and spectroscopic success rates, we
predict the final DESI Peculiar Velocity Survey will obtain $\sim$133 000
FP-based and $\sim$53 000 TF-based PV measurements over an area of 14 000

of cosmic variance at low redshifts. With these forecasts, we anticipate a
$4\%$ statistical measurement on the growth rate of structure at $z<0.15$. This
is over two times better than achievable with redshifts from the BGS alone. The

several practical implementation factors, such as a skillfully pre-processing

segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is challenging and important.
Recently, end-to-end WSSS methods have become the focus of research due to
their high training efficiency. However, current methods suffer from
insufficient extraction of comprehensive semantic information, resulting in
low-quality pseudo-labels and sub-optimal solutions for end-to-end WSSS. To
this end, we propose a simple and novel Self Correspondence Distillation (SCD)
method to refine pseudo-labels without introducing external supervision. Our
SCD enables the network to utilize feature correspondence derived from itself
as a distillation target, which can enhance the network's feature learning
process by complementing semantic information. In addition, to further improve
the segmentation accuracy, we design a Variation-aware Refine Module to enhance
the local consistency of pseudo-labels by computing pixel-level variation.
Finally, we present an efficient end-to-end Transformer-based framework (TSCD)
via SCD and Variation-aware Refine Module for the accurate WSSS task. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

that masks specific patches of a distorted image and supplements missing

generator to select the best candidate patches from reference images and
supplement the lost semantic information in distorted images, thus providing
more reference for quality assessment; in addition, the different masked
patches imply different data augmentations, which favors model training and
reduces overfitting. Second, we provide a Mask Reference Network (MRNet): the
dedicated modules can prevent disturbances due to masked patches and help
eliminate the patch discontinuity in the reconstructed image. Our method

high-temperature and low-density non-equilibrium plasmas, identifying spectral
features like charge exchange and resonance line scattering, revealing
kinematics and elemental abundances of SN ejecta and the circumstellar medium,
and studying the interstellar medium or planets' atmospheres from extinction
features seen in X-ray spectra of very bright SNRs. This chapter reviews
high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of SNRs obtained so far. Most results were
derived with dispersive spectrometers aboard Einstein, Chandra, and XMM-Newton
satellites. Because these dispersive spectrometers were slitless, one has to
select small objects with angular sizes less than a few arcminutes to
successfully perform high-resolution spectroscopy. Despite this limitation, the
three satellites delivered fruitful scientific results in the last few decades.
Arrays of low-temperature microcalorimeters offer excellent opportunities for
high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of SNRs, as they are non-dispersive
spectrometers that work for largely extended sources as well as point-like
sources. The microcalorimeter aboard the Hitomi satellite already delivered
pioneering results during its short lifetime. The upcoming X-Ray Imaging and
Spectroscopy Mission, which is a recovery mission of Hitomi, will truly open
the new discovery window to high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of SNRs.

in April 2022. Unusually however, the source stopped showing radio pulsations
$\gtrsim 3\,$weeks prior to the burst. After recovery, radio timing revealed
that the object had also undergone a modest glitch. A model for the overall
event is constructed where an initially mild perturbation adjusts the magnetic
geometry near the polar caps, leading to shallow fractures. Crustal ejecta or
particles leaking from a pair-plasma fireball pollute the magnetospheric gaps,
shutting off the pulsar mechanism, but the energy release is not yet large
enough to noticeably enhance the X-ray flux. This perturbation gradually ramps,
eventuating in a large-scale energy redistribution which fuels the burst. The
star's mass quadrupole moment changes in tandem, issuing a glitch. Some
quantitative estimates for the magnetic reconfiguration under this
interpretation are provided, based on a quasi-static model where the fluid
evolves through a sequence of hydromagnetic equilibria.

vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ spanning $G$. K\""uhn and Osthus showed that the
minimum degree threshold for a graph $G$ to contain a perfect $H$-factor is
either given by $1-1/\chi(H)$ or by $1-1/\chi_{cr}(H)$ depending on certain
natural divisibility considerations. Given a graph $G$ of order $n$, a
$2$-edge-coloring of $G$ and a subgraph $G'$ of $G$, we say that $G'$ has high
discrepancy if it contains significantly (linear in $n$) more edges of one
color than the other. Balogh, Csaba, Pluh\'ar and Treglown asked for the
minimum degree threshold guaranteeing that every 2-edge-coloring of $G$ has an
$H$-factor with high discrepancy and they settled the case where $H$ is a

degree threshold for high discrepancy of $H$-factors for every graph $H$.

$\eta-\eta'$, $\eta-\eta'-\eta_c$, $\eta-\eta'-G$, and $\eta-\eta'-G-\eta_c$

PQCD predictions with the four mixing schemes does not change much for the
$\eta$ channel but changes significantly for the $\eta'$ one. In particular,
the value of $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_b\rightarrow \Lambda \eta^{'})$ in the
$\eta-\eta'-G-\eta_c$ mixing scheme exceeds the present experimental bound by a
factor of 2, indicates the related mixing angles may be overestimated. Because
of the distinctive patterns of interference between $S$-wave and $P$-wave
amplitudes, the predicted up-down asymmetries for the two modes differ
significantly. The obvious discrepancies among different theoretical analyses
should be clarified in the future. The direct $CP$ violations are predicted to
be at the level of a few percent mainly due to the tree contributions of the
strange and nonstrange amplitudes suffer from the color suppression and CKM
suppression. Finally, as a byproduct, we investigate the $\Lambda_b\rightarrow
\Lambda \eta_c$ process, which has a large branching ratio of order $10^{-4}$,

through standard Hamiltonian methods. Remarkably, the theory endowed with this

Repeated purification merges low-fidelity qubits into higher-quality ones,

geodesic motion with respect to some metric. The corresponding analysis in the
Euclidean case famously yields the negative mass Taub-NUT metric, which
asymptotically approximates the $L ^2 $ metric on the moduli space of two
Euclidean monopoles, the Atiyah-Hitchin metric. An important difference with
the Euclidean case is that, due to the absence of Galilean symmetry, in the
hyperbolic case it is not possible to factor out the centre of mass motion.
Nevertheless we show that we can consistently restrict to a 3-dimensional
configuration space by considering antipodal configurations. In complete
parallel with the Euclidean case, the metric that we obtain is then the

current limiter (TCL) integrated into the input circuit of the sensor is
presented. The TCL is based on an unshunted Josephson Junction (JJ) series
array, around which meanders a galvanically isolated, but tightly, thermally
coupled, resistive heater element. By applying a current to the heater, the JJ
critical currents can be reduced or completely suppressed, while the other
on-chip SQUID circuit elements remain unaffected. The functional parameters of
the TCL are determined by direct transport measurements and by static and
dynamic flux coupling tests via the input circuit. In liquid Helium, a heater
power, which reliably suppresses the critical current of the JJ array to zero,
of $\sim$1.5 mW was needed, with the TCL normal state resistance being at 500
$\Omega$. In this configuration, typical TCL switching times below 10 $\mu$s
were observed in the direct transport measurements.
  The TCL can be used to temporarily or even permanently disable malfunctioning
channels in multichannel SQUID magnetometer systems, when feedback into their
otherwise superconducting input circuits is not possible. In doing so,
significant signal distortions in neighbouring channels from screening currents
in these input circuits are avoided. Furthermore, by completely suppressing and
restoring the TCL critical current, dc offset currents in the superconducting
input circuits can be prevented. This is relevant, for instance, in SQUID-based
spin precession experiments on hyperpolarized noble gases, in which even dc
currents of a few $\mu$A in the input circuit can lead to significant magnetic
field distortions in the adjacent sample region contributing to the transverse
spin-spin relaxation rate $1/T_{2}$

a new target domain by actively selecting limited target data to annotate,
whereas traditional active learning methods may be less effective since they do
not consider the domain shift issue. Despite active DA methods address this by
further proposing targetness to measure the representativeness of target domain
characteristics, their predictive uncertainty is usually based on the
prediction of deterministic models, which can easily be miscalibrated on data
with distribution shift. Considering this, we propose a \textit{Dirichlet-based
Uncertainty Calibration} (DUC) approach for active DA, which simultaneously
achieves the mitigation of miscalibration and the selection of informative
target samples. Specifically, we place a Dirichlet prior on the prediction and
interpret the prediction as a distribution on the probability simplex, rather
than a point estimate like deterministic models. This manner enables us to
consider all possible predictions, mitigating the miscalibration of unilateral
prediction. Then a two-round selection strategy based on different uncertainty
origins is designed to select target samples that are both representative of
target domain and conducive to discriminability. Extensive experiments on
cross-domain image classification and semantic segmentation validate the
superiority of DUC.

Learning (DL), all participants train locally and then aggregate with their
immediate neighbors, resulting in many local models with residual variance
between them. On the one hand, FL's sampling and lower model variance provides
lower communication costs and faster convergence. On the other hand, DL removes
the need for a central server and distributes the communication costs more
evenly amongst nodes, albeit at a larger total communication cost and slower
convergence.

specific surface area. First, the equilibrium molecular dynamics approach was
used to obtain the dependence of thermal conductivity on a specific surface
area. Then, a modified phonon transport kinetic theory-based approach was
developed to analyze thermal conductivity. Two models were used to evaluate the
phonon mean free path in the porous materials. The first model approximates the
dependence of the mean free path only with the specific surface area, and the
second one investigates the dependence of the mean free path variation with the
porosity in the peculiar case of a highly porous matrix. Both models
approximate molecular dynamics data well for the smaller porosity values, while
the first model fails for large porosities. The second model matches well with
molecular dynamics simulations for all considered ranges of the porosities.
This work illustrates that the phonon mean free path dependence with the
porosity/volume fraction of composite materials is essential for describing
thermal transport in systems with significant surface-to-volume fractions.

models are further expected to express customized concepts. Existing works
generally learn such concepts in an optimization-based manner, yet bringing
excessive computation or memory burden. In this paper, we instead propose a
learning-based encoder for fast and accurate concept customization, which
consists of global and local mapping networks. In specific, the global mapping
network separately projects the hierarchical features of a given image into
multiple ``new'' words in the textual word embedding space, i.e., one primary
word for well-editable concept and other auxiliary words to exclude irrelevant
disturbances (e.g., background). In the meantime, a local mapping network
injects the encoded patch features into cross attention layers to provide
omitted details, without sacrificing the editability of primary concepts. We
compare our method with prior optimization-based approaches on a variety of
user-defined concepts, and demonstrate that our method enables more
high-fidelity inversion and robust editability with a significantly faster
encoding process. Our code will be publicly available at

achievable by deterministic learners using the Littlestone dimension
(Littlestone '88). We prove an analogous result for randomized learners: we
show that the optimal expected mistake bound in learning a class $\mathcal{H}$
equals its randomized Littlestone dimension, which is the largest $d$ for which
there exists a tree shattered by $\mathcal{H}$ whose average depth is $2d$. We
further study optimal mistake bounds in the agnostic case, as a function of the
number of mistakes made by the best function in $\mathcal{H}$, denoted by $k$.
We show that the optimal randomized mistake bound for learning a class with
Littlestone dimension $d$ is $k + \Theta (\sqrt{k d} + d )$. This also implies
an optimal deterministic mistake bound of $2k + O (\sqrt{k d} + d )$, thus
resolving an open question which was studied by Auer and Long ['99].
  As an application of our theory, we revisit the classical problem of
prediction using expert advice: about 30 years ago Cesa-Bianchi, Freund,
Haussler, Helmbold, Schapire and Warmuth studied prediction using expert
advice, provided that the best among the $n$ experts makes at most $k$
mistakes, and asked what are the optimal mistake bounds. Cesa-Bianchi, Freund,
Helmbold, and Warmuth ['93, '96] provided a nearly optimal bound for
deterministic learners, and left the randomized case as an open problem. We
resolve this question by providing an optimal learning rule in the randomized

deterministic bound, up to negligible additive terms. This improves upon
previous works by Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, Haussler, Helmbold, Schapire and

interaction to force the agent into adopting a policy of interest, called
target policy. Prior work has primarily focused on attacks that modify standard
MDP primitives, such as rewards or transitions. In this paper, we study
targeted poisoning attacks in a two-agent setting where an attacker implicitly
poisons the effective environment of one of the agents by modifying the policy
of its peer. We develop an optimization framework for designing optimal
attacks, where the cost of the attack measures how much the solution deviates
from the assumed default policy of the peer agent. We further study the
computational properties of this optimization framework. Focusing on a tabular
setting, we show that in contrast to poisoning attacks based on MDP primitives
(transitions and (unbounded) rewards), which are always feasible, it is NP-hard
to determine the feasibility of implicit poisoning attacks. We provide
characterization results that establish sufficient conditions for the
feasibility of the attack problem, as well as an upper and a lower bound on the
optimal cost of the attack. We propose two algorithmic approaches for finding
an optimal adversarial policy: a model-based approach with tabular policies and
a model-free approach with parametric/neural policies. We showcase the efficacy

error rate for a set of quantum logic gates. However, the standard version of
RB is limited because it only benchmarks a processor's native gates indirectly,
by using them in composite $n$-qubit Clifford gates. Standard RB's reliance on
$n$-qubit Clifford gates restricts it to the few-qubit regime, because the
fidelity of a typical composite $n$-qubit Clifford gate decreases rapidly with
increasing $n$. Furthermore, although standard RB is often used to infer the
error rate of native gates, by rescaling standard RB's error per Clifford to an
error per native gate, this is an unreliable extrapolation. Direct RB is a
method that addresses these limitations of standard RB, by directly
benchmarking a customizable gate set, such as a processor's native gates. Here
we provide a detailed introduction to direct RB, we discuss how to design
direct RB experiments, and we present two complementary theories for direct RB.
The first of these theories uses the concept of error propagation or scrambling
in random circuits to show that direct RB is reliable for gates that experience
stochastic Pauli errors. We prove that the direct RB decay is a single
exponential, and that the decay rate is equal to the average infidelity of the
benchmarked gates, under broad circumstances. This theory shows that group
twirling is not required for reliable RB. Our second theory proves that direct
RB is reliable for gates that experience general gate-dependent Markovian
errors, using similar techniques to contemporary theories for standard RB. Our
two theories for direct RB have complementary regimes of applicability, and
they provide complementary perspectives on why direct RB works. Together these
theories provide comprehensive guarantees on the reliability of direct RB.

three different fissioning systems. The amount of dissipation was obtained

fine-tuning ImageNet pre-trained diffusion models with more than 80M
parameters, we obtain SOTA results on CIFAR-10 and Camelyon17 in terms of both
FID and the accuracy of downstream classifiers trained on synthetic data. We
decrease the SOTA FID on CIFAR-10 from 26.2 to 9.8, and increase the accuracy
from 51.0% to 88.0%. On synthetic data from Camelyon17, we achieve a downstream
accuracy of 91.1% which is close to the SOTA of 96.5% when training on the real

to use synthetic data for hyperparameter tuning. Our results demonstrate that

environments where privilege boundaries are fluid (dynamically extensible),
memory sharing/delegation are desired both temporally and spatially, and where
such needs are to be balanced with availability concerns. Capstone can also be

of this system exhibit a robust spin-polarization that is protected from

quantum approach to the classical approach, which conventionally predicts fully
polarized YSR excitations even in the absence of exchange and external magnetic

transitions take place has not been sufficiently touched in the literature. In
contrast, the current attention to certain extent still focus on the
description of critical phenomena and the classification of the associated
phase transition along with the Ginzburg-Landau-Wilson paradigm, where the key
issue is to identify phenomenologically order parameters and related
symmetries. This brings the question to topological phase transitions (TPTs),
where no obvious order parameter and the broken symmetry are identified. Here
we present a unified pattern description of the second-order quantum phase
transition (QPT) and TPT, both involved in the one-dimensional anisotropic
quantum XY model in a transverse field, which contains the transverse Ising
model (TIM) as a limit case. Away from the TIM, the XY model enters the
ferromagnetic phase (marked by a second-order QPT or a direct TPT) as
increasing ferromagentic exchange coupling, a series of TPTs occur, which are
absent in the TIM. The TPTs behave like the first-order QPTs. In the isotropic
and large exchange coupling cases, the ground state of the XY model is
dominated by two topologically different vortices along positive and negative
direction of the transverse field. We confirm the above conclusion by analyzing
the energy contributions of the patterns to the ground state and calculating
the ground state pattern occupations of the XY model. The results have been
obtained in a unified and self-evident way and answer the questions why and how
the QPT and TPTs take place in the XY model.

representation of the masked image blocks, while the student encoder extracts
the latent representation of the visible image blocks. A loss is calculated
between the feature maps output from two encoders to ensure consistency in the
latent representations they extracted. EDMAE replaces the VIT structure in the
encoder of traditional MAE with pure convolution operation to improve training
efficiency. EDMAE is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on a large-scale
private dataset of pediatric echocardiography, and then fine-tuned on the
downstream task of standard view recognition. The high classification accuracy
is achieved in 27 standard views of pediatric echocardiography. To further
validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, another downstream task of
cardiac ultrasound segmentation is performed on a public dataset CAMUS. The
experiments show that the proposed method not only can surpass some recent
supervised methods but also has more competitiveness on different downstream
tasks.

coupling with the fuel consumption dynamics, allowing for both even- and
odd-parity self-propulsion forces. Using the standard methods of stochastic
thermodynamics, we show that the entropy production of the engine satisfies the
conventional Clausius relation, based on which we define the efficiency of the
model that is bounded from above by the second law of thermodynamics. Using
this framework, we obtain exact expressions for the efficiency at maximum
power. The results show that the engine performance has a nonmonotonic
dependence on the magnitude of the chemical driving, and that the even-parity
(odd-parity) engines perform better when the size of the engine is smaller

the existence of a tighter upper bound on the efficiency of the odd-parity

filters such as the iterated extended Kalman filter (IEKF), iterated unscented
Kalman filter (IUKF) and iterated posterior linearization filter (IPLF),
dynamically iterated filters also take nonlinearities in the transition model
into account. The general filtering algorithm is shown to essentially be a
(locally over one time step) iterated Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. Three
distinct versions of the dynamically iterated filters are especially
investigated: analogues to the IEKF, IUKF and IPLF. The developed algorithms
are evaluated on 25 different noise configurations of a tracking problem with a
nonlinear transition model and linear measurement model, a scenario where
conventional iterated filters are not useful. Even in this ""simple"" scenario,
the dynamically iterated filters are shown to have superior root mean-squared
error performance as compared with their respective baselines, the EKF and UKF.
Particularly, even though the EKF diverges in 22 out of 25 configurations, the
dynamically iterated EKF remains stable in 20 out of 25 scenarios, only
diverging under high noise.

to several structural node properties: popularity, locality, and density. In
our experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed distributional shifts and
show that they can be quite challenging for existing graph models. We also
reveal that simple models often outperform more sophisticated methods on these
challenging shifts. Finally, our experiments provide evidence that there is a
trade-off between the quality of learned representations for the base

collect in reality. Thus, we present the Fully Immersive Virtual Reality System

with a high-fidelity hardware setup.
  Methods: FIVRS allows surgeons to follow normal clinical workflows inside the
VR environment. FIVRS uses advanced rendering designs and drilling algorithms
for realistic bone ablation. A head-mounted display with ergonomics similar to
that of surgical microscopes is used to improve immersiveness. Extensive
multi-modal data is recorded for post-analysis, including eye gaze, motion,

ease the learning curve of using FIVRS.
  Results: We present results from a user study involving surgeons with various

between participants with different levels of expertise, promising future
research on automatic skill assessment. Furthermore, informal feedback from the
study participants about the system's intuitiveness and immersiveness was

into the fitted parameters. In this paper, we study the three effects together
from a new fractal angle by physical calculation instead of data fitting. Near
the critical temperature, the three effects induce $J/\psi$ and neighboring
meson to form a two-meson structure. We set up a two-particle fractal (TPF)
model to describe this structure. We propose that under the three effects,
$J/\psi$-$\pi$ two-meson state, $J/\psi$ and $\pi$ two-quark states form a
self-similarity structure. With evolution, the two-meson structure
disintegrate. We introduce an influencing factor $q_{fqs}$ to describe the
flow, quantum and strong interaction effects and an escort factor $q_2$ to
describe the binding force and the three effects. By solving the probability
and entropy equations, we obtain the values of $q_{fqs}$ and $q_2$ at different
collision energies and centrality classes. By substituting the value of
$q_{fqs}$ into distribution function, we obtain the transverse momentum
spectrum of low-$p_T$ $J/\psi$ and find it in good agreement with experimental
data. We also analyze the evolution of $q_{fqs}$ with the temperature. It is
found that $q_{fqs}$ is larger than 1. This is because the three effects
decrease the number of microstates. We also find $q_{fqs}$ decreases with
decreasing the temperature. This is consistent with the fact that with the
system expansion, the influence of the three effects decrease.

  Problem",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The kidney exchange problem (KEP) seeks to find possible exchanges among
pairs of patients and their incompatible kidney donors while meeting specific
optimization criteria such as maximizing the overall number of possible
transplants. In practice, patient-donor pairs register with so-called kidney
exchange platforms which determine exchange cycles in a centralized fashion.
Such a centralized approach raises numerous security concerns. Thus, several
privacy-preserving protocols for solving the KEP have been proposed recently.
However, the protocols known to date lack scalability in practice since the KEP
is an NP-complete problem. We address this issue by proposing a novel
privacy-preserving protocol which computes an approximate solution to the KEP
that scales well for the large numbers of patient-donor pairs encountered in
practice. In contrast to the only other existing protocol that computes an
approximate solution to the KEP, our protocol is entirely data oblivious and it
exhibits a far superior run time performance without suffering a loss in the
quality of the approximation. As a second contribution, we simulate the
application of our novel protocol as part of a kidney exchange platform, where
patient-donor pairs register and de-register over time and exchanges are
determined on a regular basis. In this dynamic setting, the application of our
novel privacy-preserving approximation protocol yields a larger number of
transplants over time than using the best known privacy-preserving protocol for
solving the KEP. Our simulation further shows that the difference between the
number of transplants found when using our novel protocol in this dynamic
setting compared to the non-privacy-preserving state-of-the-art approach is
negligible in practice.

to extend the redshift coverage of lensing systems much higher than that of
Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) and even higher than quasars, whilst the general
cosmography with a curvature component is implemented for the GRB distance

H_0$ falls by 25\%, whereas $\Omega_{K,0}$ is not improved due to the
degeneracy between SN Ia absolute magnitude, $M_B$, and $H_0$ along with the
mismatch between the SN Ia and GRB Hubble diagrams at $z\gtrsim 1.4$. Future
increment of GRB observations can help to moderately eliminate the $M_B-H_0$
degeneracy in SN Ia distances and ameliorate the restrictions on cosmographic

conclude that there is no evidence of significant deviation from a (an) flat

detached eddy simulation (DES) and large eddy simulation (LES) with special
emphasis on the interaction of coherent vortex structures with free-surface. In
order to set up and validate the computational model, experimental studies were
conducted in a laboratory flume using a moderately rounded broad-crested weir
with a rounding ratio of R/P=0.15, where R is the radius of the upstream nose
and P is the height of the weir. The simulated mean velocity, Reynolds stresses
and free-surface profiles show good agreement with the experimental
measurements. Spatial variation of the boundary layer on the crest is well
captured using a dimensionless form of the Lamb vector divergence. Boundary
layer shape factor calculated over the weir was found to be lie between 0.76
and 0.92. A horseshoe vortex system emanating from the bottom of the channel
interacts with the free-surface at the entrance of the crest causing undulation
on the free-surface. Unsteady characteristics of the flow are examined in terms
of the power spectral density (PSD) of vortex-induced forces acting on the
weir. It is found that a free-surface boundary layer develops from the
undulation to the wall boundary layer on the crest. It was revealed from the
simulations for various Reynolds numbers that the installation of an artificial
pool upstream of the weir significantly modified vortex structures and reduced
undulation effects by 86% according to a proposed undulation index.

tipping point. We first demonstrate the feasibility of our method by applying
it to a case study of a tipping point in major depressive disorder, resulting
in a list of symptoms that are most likely to be closely related to the order
parameter in this particular system. Subsequently, we probe the usefulness of
our approach in the interdisciplinary context of complexity science by means of
exploratory interviews with active scientists. Our results suggest a growing

plate flying at supersonic speed are numerically investigated. The bump is
located at the impingement position of the shock wave and is moved at different
speeds. This study determines the suitable speed that achieves the minimum
entropy change, which is the representation parameter of the transition period.
The two-dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations are solved using OpenFOAM
to simulate the flow field variables, while the motion of the bump is tracked
using the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique. The results show that
a spatial lag on the shock system from the steady-state solution occurs due to
the movement of the bump. Further, the spatial lag increases with the increase
in the bump's speed. This causes a high increase in the flow parameters and
consequently the total entropy changes on the bump surface. Generally, it is
common to move the bump over the longest possible time to approximate a
quasi-steady flow during the motion. However, this causes a deviation in the
flow parameters between the final time of transition and the steady-state case
of bump existence. Thus, it is concluded that the optimal non-dimensional time
for a morphing bump in a supersonic flow of Mach number of 2.9 is 2, which is
different than the longest time of 10.

efficacy in modeling the complex heterogeneity in heterogeneous information

diverse node and edge types in HINs by extracting and utilizing the abundant
semantic information for effective representation learning. However, as a
widespread phenomenon in many real-world scenarios, the class-imbalance
distribution in HINs creates a performance bottleneck for existing HGNNs. Apart
from the quantity imbalance of nodes, another more crucial and distinctive
challenge in HINs is semantic imbalance. Minority classes in HINs often lack
diverse and sufficient neighbor nodes, resulting in biased and incomplete
semantic information. This semantic imbalance further compounds the difficulty
of accurately classifying minority nodes, leading to the performance
degradation of HGNNs. To tackle the imbalance of minority classes and
supplement their inadequate semantics, we present the first method for the
semantic imbalance problem in imbalanced HINs named Semantic-aware Node
Synthesis (SNS). By assessing the influence on minority classes, SNS adaptively
selects the heterogeneous neighbor nodes and augments the network with
synthetic nodes while preserving the minority semantics. In addition, we
introduce two regularization approaches for HGNNs that constrain the
representation of synthetic nodes from both semantic and class perspectives to
effectively suppress the potential noises from synthetic nodes, facilitating
more expressive embeddings for classification. The comprehensive experimental
study demonstrates that SNS consistently outperforms existing methods by a

with the daunting tasks of unifying stakeholders' perspectives, designers'
intellect, tool-based automation, pattern-driven reuse, and so on, to sketch a
blueprint that guides software implementation and evaluation. Despite its
benefits, architecture-centric software engineering (ACSE) inherits a multitude
of challenges. ACSE challenges could stem from a lack of standardized
processes, socio-technical limitations, and scarcity of human expertise etc.
that can impede the development of existing and emergent classes of software
(e.g., IoTs, blockchain, quantum systems). Software Development Bots (DevBots)
trained on large language models can help synergise architects' knowledge with
artificially intelligent decision support to enable rapid architecting in a
human-bot collaborative ACSE. An emerging solution to enable this collaboration
is ChatGPT, a disruptive technology not primarily introduced for software
engineering, but is capable of articulating and refining architectural
artifacts based on natural language processing. We detail a case study that
involves collaboration between a novice software architect and ChatGPT for
architectural analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of a services-driven software
application. Preliminary results indicate that ChatGPT can mimic an architect's
role to support and often lead ACSE, however; it requires human oversight and
decision support for collaborative architecting. Future research focuses on
harnessing empirical evidence about architects' productivity and exploring
socio-technical aspects of architecting with ChatGPT to tackle emerging and
futuristic challenges of ACSE.

mitigating this problem is by concretizing the scope for the system under test

demonstrate. A popular approach to testing ADS is scenario-based testing where
the ADS is presented with driving scenarios from real world (and synthetically

through the scenario. We present SAFR-AV, an end-to-end ADS testing platform to
enable scenario-based ADS testing. Our work addresses key real-world challenges

securitization and mortgages, commercial banks are becoming more complex,
branching out into many ""nontraditional"" banking operations beyond issuance of
loans. This broadening of operational scope in a pursuit of revenue
diversification may be beneficial if banks exhibit scope economies. The
existing (two-decade-old) empirical evidence lends no support for such
product-scope-driven cost economies in banking, but it is greatly outdated and,
surprisingly, there has been little (if any) research on this subject despite
the drastic transformations that the U.S. banking industry has undergone over
the past two decades in the wake of technological advancements and regulatory
changes. Commercial banks have significantly shifted towards nontraditional
operations, making the portfolio of products offered by present-day banks very
different from that two decades ago. In this paper, we provide new and more
robust evidence about scope economies in U.S. commercial banking. We improve
upon the prior literature not only by analyzing the most recent data and
accounting for bank's nontraditional off-balance sheet operations, but also in
multiple methodological ways. To test for scope economies, we estimate a
flexible time-varying-coefficient panel-data quantile regression model which
accommodates three-way heterogeneity across banks. Our results provide strong
evidence in support of significantly positive scope economies across banks of
virtually all sizes. Contrary to earlier studies, we find no empirical
corroboration for scope diseconomies.

compactification of the spacetime to a manifold with corners, the wave
operators are of edge type at null infinity and totally characteristic at

the second author with Baskin and Wunsch, we prove regularity and decay
estimates for forward solutions of wave type equations on asymptotically flat

derived from the principle of least observability. Observability is a concept
introduced here to measure the distinguishability (or traceability) that a
physical object exhibits during its dynamics. To quantify observability, we
assume that the Planck constant defines the discrete amount of action a
physical object needs to exhibit in order to be observable. Then, observability
is calculated by 1.) dividing the action variable along the classical path by
the Planck constant, and 2.) adding information metrics on distinguishability
due to vacuum fluctuations. The least observability principle not only recovers
quantum formulations including the uncertainty relation and the Schr\""{o}dinger
equation in both position and momentum representations, but also brings in new
results on two fronts. At the conceptual level, we find that the information
metrics for vacuum fluctuations are responsible for manifesting entanglement
effects without underlying physical interactions, implying that entanglement
effects are non-causal. At the mathematical level, defining the information
metrics for vacuum fluctuations using more general definitions of relative
entropy results in a generalized Schr\""{o}dinger equation that depends on the
order of relative entropy. The least observability principle is a new
mathematical tool, and we expect other advanced quantum formulations can be
obtained from it.

Preference Learning has been developed to exploit this specific information in
constructing a surrogate function based on standard radial basis functions, and
then forming an easy-to-solve acquisition function which repetitively suggests
new decision vectors to search for the optimal solution. Based on this idea,
our approach aims to extend the algorithm in such a way that can exploit

full potential of Transformer unexplored. In this paper, we consider the

called SpeechFormer++, for paralinguistic speech processing. More concretely,
following the component relationship in the speech signal, we design a unit
encoder to model the intra- and inter-unit information (i.e., frames, phones,
and words) efficiently. According to the hierarchical relationship, we utilize
merging blocks to generate features at different granularities, which is
consistent with the structural pattern in the speech signal. Moreover, a word
encoder is introduced to integrate word-grained features into each unit
encoder, which effectively balances fine-grained and coarse-grained
information. SpeechFormer++ is evaluated on the speech emotion recognition
(IEMOCAP & MELD), depression classification (DAIC-WOZ) and Alzheimer's disease

out that the black hole shadow radius shows a positive correlation as a

the black hole temperature and heat capacity can be presented by the shadow

we constructed the thermal profile of the charged AdS black hole with inclusion

nonstationary asymptotically flat spacetimes, under the assumptions of mode
stability and absence of zero energy resonances for a stationary model
operator. Our methods apply in all spacetime dimensions and to tensorial
equations, and they do not require any symmetry or almost-symmetry assumptions
on the spacetime metrics or on the wave type operators. Moreover, we allow for
the presence of terms which are asymptotically scaling critical at infinity,
such as inverse square potentials. For simplicity of presentation, we do not
allow for normally hyperbolic trapping or horizons.
  In the first part of the paper, we study stationary wave type equations, i.e.
equations with time-translation symmetry, and prove pointwise upper bounds for
their solutions. We establish a relationship between pointwise decay rates and
weights related to the mapping properties of the zero energy operator. Under a
nondegeneracy assumption, we prove that this relationship is sharp by
extracting leading order asymptotic profiles at late times. The main tool is
the analysis of the resolvent at low energies.
  In the second part, we consider a class of wave operators without
time-translation symmetry which settle down to stationary operators at a rate
$t_*^{-\delta}$ as an appropriate hyperboloidal time function $t_*$ tends to
infinity. The main result is a sharp solvability theory for forward problems on
a scale of polynomially weighted spacetime $L^2$-Sobolev spaces. The proof
combines a regularity theory for the nonstationary operator with the
invertibility of the stationary model established in the first part. The
regularity theory is fully microlocal and utilizes edge-b-analysis near null
infinity, as developed in joint work with Vasy, and 3b-analysis in the forward

whether or not the exponential distribution, whose parameter had been estimated
by Maximum Likelihood Estimation, was suitable for representing the waiting
times computed from the model parameters. Finally, both parametric and
non-parametric density estimation of the frequency histograms associated with
the variability of the glucose elimination rate from blood into the external
environment were conducted and their representative parameters assessed from
the data. The results show that the chosen models succeed in capturing most of
the glucose fluctuations for almost every patient.

absolute time, a fundamental physical quantity that is independent of the

absolute simultaneity, which in turn leads to the notion of absolute distance
between two points. The existence of absolute space follows as a consequence.
These concepts apply to every field of physics to which the angular momentum
balance law applies, and in particular to the theory of special relativity. The
paper also shows that in a vacuum, the independence of the speed of light from
the motion of its source makes it possible to determine the absolute positions
of all points in space. The same independence also allows us to determine the
state of absolute rest or motion of a reference frame from within the frame

federated learning model across multiple local quantum devices. An efficient
optimization algorithm is always expected to minimize the communication
overhead among different quantum participants. In this work, we propose an
efficient optimization algorithm, namely federated quantum natural gradient
descent (FQNGD), and further, apply it to a QFL framework that is composed of a
variational quantum circuit (VQC)-based quantum neural networks (QNN). Compared
with stochastic gradient descent methods like Adam and Adagrad, the FQNGD
algorithm admits much fewer training iterations for the QFL to get converged.
Moreover, it can significantly reduce the total communication overhead among
local quantum devices. Our experiments on a handwritten digit classification
dataset justify the effectiveness of the FQNGD for the QFL framework in terms
of a faster convergence rate on the training set and higher accuracy on the

  Talking Face Video","Accepted in AAAI2023",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Forced alignment refers to a technology that time-aligns a given
transcription with a corresponding speech. However, as the forced alignment
technologies have developed using speech audio, they might fail in alignment
when the input speech audio is noise-corrupted or is not accessible. We focus
on that there is another component that the speech can be inferred from, the
speech video (i.e., talking face video). Since the drawbacks of audio-based
forced alignment can be complemented using the visual information when the
audio signal is under poor condition, we try to develop a novel video-based
forced alignment method. However, different from audio forced alignment, it is
challenging to develop a reliable visual forced alignment technology for the
following two reasons: 1) Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) has a much lower
performance compared to audio-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), and 2)
the translation from text to video is not reliable, so the method typically
used for building audio forced alignment cannot be utilized in developing
visual forced alignment. In order to alleviate these challenges, in this paper,
we propose a new method that is appropriate for visual forced alignment, namely
Deep Visual Forced Alignment (DVFA). The proposed DVFA can align the input
transcription (i.e., sentence) with the talking face video without accessing
the speech audio. Moreover, by augmenting the alignment task with anomaly case
detection, DVFA can detect mismatches between the input transcription and the
input video while performing the alignment. Therefore, we can robustly align
the text with the talking face video even if there exist error words in the
text. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed
DVFA not only in the alignment task but also in interpreting the outputs of VSR
models.

as memes, is crucial for building a wholesome internet environment. Previous
work has made enlightening exploration in detecting explicit hate remarks.
However, most of their approaches neglect the analysis of implicit harm, which
is particularly challenging as explicit text markers and demographic visual
cues are often twisted or missing. The leveraged cross-modal attention
mechanisms also suffer from the distributional modality gap and lack logical
interpretability. To address these semantic gaps issues, we propose TOT: a
topology-aware optimal transport framework to decipher the implicit harm in
memes scenario, which formulates the cross-modal aligning problem as solutions
for optimal transportation plans. Specifically, we leverage an optimal
transport kernel method to capture complementary information from multiple
modalities. The kernel embedding provides a non-linear transformation ability
to reproduce a kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which reflects significance for
eliminating the distributional modality gap. Moreover, we perceive the topology
information based on aligned representations to conduct bipartite graph path
reasoning. The newly achieved state-of-the-art performance on two publicly
available benchmark datasets, together with further visual analysis,
demonstrate the superiority of TOT in capturing implicit cross-modal alignment.

four soundness bugs in the original (which were not being exploited in MML), in

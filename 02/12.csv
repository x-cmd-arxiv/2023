  epileptogenic tissue",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Objective: Identifying abnormalities in interictal intracranial EEG, by
comparing patient data to a normative map, has shown promise for the
localisation of epileptogenic tissue and prediction of outcome. The approach
typically uses short interictal segments of around one minute. However, the
temporal stability of findings has not been established.
  Methods: Here, we generated a normative map of iEEG in non-pathological brain
tissue from 249 patients. We computed regional band power abnormalities in a
separate cohort of 39 patients for the duration of their monitoring period
(0.92-8.62 days of iEEG data, mean 4.58 days per patient, over 4,800 hours
recording). To assess the localising value of band power abnormality, we
computed DRS - a measure of how different the surgically resected and spared
tissue were in terms of band power abnormalities - over time.
  Results: In each patient, band power abnormality was relatively consistent
over time. The median DRS of the entire recording period separated seizure free
(ILAE = 1) and not seizure free (ILAE > 1) patients well (AUC = 0.69). This
effect was similar interictally (AUC = 0.69) and peri-ictally (AUC = 0.71).
  Significance: Our results suggest that band power abnormality DRS, as a
predictor of outcomes from epilepsy surgery, is a relatively robust metric over
time. These findings add further support for abnormality mapping of
neurophysiology data during presurgical evaluation.

the one hand, the energy structure, which conforms with the principle of the

transient energy flow for VSCs, and on this basis, a defined characteristic
quantity is implemented to narrow the scope of oscillation source location; on
the other hand, according to the self-sustained oscillation characteristics of
VSCs, an index for nonlinearity detection is applied to locate the VSCs which
produce the oscillation energy. The combination of the energy structure and
nonlinearity detection could distinguish the contributions of different VSCs to
the oscillation. The results of a case study implemented by the PSCAD/EMTDC
simulation validate the proposed scheme.

been proposed to improve the robustness of face anti-spoofing (FAS) systems.
However, there are still no works to explore the fundamental natures
(\textit{e.g.}, modality-aware inputs, suitable multimodal pre-training, and
efficient finetuning) in vanilla ViT for multimodal FAS. In this paper, we
investigate three key factors (i.e., inputs, pre-training, and finetuning) in
ViT for multimodal FAS with RGB, Infrared (IR), and Depth. First, in terms of
the ViT inputs, we find that leveraging local feature descriptors benefits the
ViT on IR modality but not RGB or Depth modalities. Second, in observation of
the inefficiency on direct finetuning the whole or partial ViT, we design an
adaptive multimodal adapter (AMA), which can efficiently aggregate local
multimodal features while freezing majority of ViT parameters. Finally, in
consideration of the task (FAS vs. generic object classification) and modality
(multimodal vs. unimodal) gaps, ImageNet pre-trained models might be
sub-optimal for the multimodal FAS task. To bridge these gaps, we propose the
modality-asymmetric masked autoencoder (M$^{2}$A$^{2}$E) for multimodal FAS
self-supervised pre-training without costly annotated labels. Compared with the
previous modality-symmetric autoencoder, the proposed M$^{2}$A$^{2}$E is able
to learn more intrinsic task-aware representation and compatible with
modality-agnostic (e.g., unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal) downstream settings.
Extensive experiments with both unimodal (RGB, Depth, IR) and multimodal
(RGB+Depth, RGB+IR, Depth+IR, RGB+Depth+IR) settings conducted on multimodal
FAS benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods. We
hope these findings and solutions can facilitate the future research for
ViT-based multimodal FAS.

$V_j\in \psi$ which is not a connected dominating set. The connected coalition
number, denoted by $CC(G)$, is the maximum cardinality of a connected coalition

  In this paper, we initiate the study of connected coalition in graphs and
present some basic results. Precisely, we characterize all graphs that have a
connected coalition partition. Moreover, we show that for any graph $G$ of
order $n$ with $\delta(G)=1$ and with no full vertex, it holds that $CC(G)<n$.
Furthermore, we show that for any tree $T$, $CC(T)=2$. Finally, we present two
polynomial-time algorithms that for a given connected graph $G$ of order $n$
determine whether $CC(G)=n$ or $CC(G)=n-1$.

the talker that a listener is focused on in a noisy environment. This is done
by comparing the listener's brainwaves to a representation of all the sound
sources to find the closest match. The representation is typically the waveform
or spectrogram of the sounds. The effectiveness of these representations for
AAD is uncertain. In this study, we examined the use of self-supervised learned
speech representation in improving the accuracy and speed of AAD. We recorded
the brain activity of three subjects using invasive electrocorticography (ECoG)
as they listened to two conversations and focused on one. We used WavLM to
extract a latent representation of each talker and trained a spatiotemporal
filter to map brain activity to intermediate representations of speech. During
the evaluation, the reconstructed representation is compared to each speaker's
representation to determine the target speaker. Our results indicate that
speech representation from WavLM provides better decoding accuracy and speed
than the speech envelope and spectrogram. Our findings demonstrate the
advantages of self-supervised learned speech representation for auditory
attention decoding and pave the way for developing brain-controlled hearable

particle images within interrogation windows, leading to a spatial modulation
of the velocity field. Although in principle Particle Tracking Velocimetry
(PTV) estimates locally a non-modulated particle displacement, to exploit the
scattered data from PTV it is necessary to interpolate these data on a
structured grid, which implies a spatial modulation effect that biases the
resulting velocity field. This systematic error due to finite spatial
resolution inevitably depends on the interrogation window size and on the
interparticle spacing. It must be observed that all these operations
(cross-correlation, direct interpolation or averaging in windows) induce
modulation on both the mean and the fluctuating part. We introduce a simple
trick to reduce this systematic error source of PIV/PTV measurements exploiting
ensemble statistics. Ensemble Particle Tracking Velocimetry (EPTV) can be
leveraged to obtain the high-resolution mean flow by merging the different
instantaneous realisations. The mean flow can be estimated with EPTV, and the
fluctuating part can be measured from PIV/PTV. The high-resolution mean can
then be superposed to the instantaneous fluctuating part to obtain velocity
fields with lower systematic error. The methodology is validated against
datasets with a progressively increasing level of complexity: two virtual
experiments based on direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the wake of a
fluidic pinball and a channel flow and the experimental data of a turbulent
boundary layer. For all the cases both PTV and PIV are analysed.

dominated regimes, the neutral particle velocity distribution approaches the
drifting Maxwellian defined by the mean velocity and temperature of the plasma.
This enables model order reduction from the kinetic equation to approximate
fluid models. We derive transient fluid models consistent with the kinetic
equation by exploring a splitting based approach. We split the kinetic equation
in sources and sinks on the one hand, and transport combined with
charge-exchange on the other hand. Combining transport with charge-exchange
collisions allows for deriving Hilbert expansion based fluid models. The
retrieved fluid models depend on the assumed importance (scaling) of the
different terms in the split equation describing transport and charge-exchange.
We explore two scalings: the hydrodynamic scaling and the diffusive scaling.

random samples of the dark matter (DM) sub-halos that are nearly isotropically

hydrodynamical simulations of the formation and evolution of Milky-Way-like
galaxy systems to investigate the spatial distribution of the luminous
satellites and DM sub-halos around the central galaxy. Results. We find that
the satellites and DM sub-halos are indeed anisotropically distributed with a
direction roughly along the local DM filament. The observed alignment of the
satellites in these systems is likely the result of preferred accretion along
the local DM filaments in the galaxy formation process. For the dynamical
properties of the satellites, we find that the direction of the angular
momentum vector of the whole satellite system is different from the normal
direction of the fitted ""disk of satellites"" (DOS) and the normal direction of
the velocity dispersion of the system. Hence, the fitted DOS appears to be
infalling and is not rotationally supported in this study.

free energy principle. We then provide a framework for introducing action
during inference. We introduce a new measurement called stochastic surprisal
that is a function of the network, the input, and any possible action. This
action can be any one of the outputs that the neural network has learnt,
thereby lending stochasticity to the measurement. Stochastic surprisal is
validated on two applications: Image Quality Assessment and Recognition under
noisy conditions. We show that, while noise characteristics are ignored to make
robust recognition, they are analyzed to estimate image quality scores. We
apply stochastic surprisal on two applications, three datasets, and as a
plug-in on twelve networks. In all, it provides a statistically significant
increase among all measures. We conclude by discussing the implications of the
proposed stochastic surprisal in other areas of cognitive psychology including
expectancy-mismatch and abductive reasoning.

downstream task by finetuning has many benefits. The choice of task head plays
an important role in fine-tuning, as the pretrained and downstream tasks are
usually different. Although there exist many different designs for finetuning,
a full understanding of when and why these algorithms work has been elusive. We
analyze how the choice of task head controls feature adaptation and hence
influences the downstream performance. By decomposing the learning dynamics of
adaptation, we find that the key aspect is the training accuracy and loss at
the beginning of finetuning, which determines the ""energy"" available for the
feature's adaptation. We identify a significant trend in the effect of changes
in this initial energy on the resulting features after fine-tuning.
Specifically, as the energy increases, the Euclidean and cosine distances
between the resulting and original features increase, while their dot products
(and the resulting features' norm) first increase and then decrease. Inspired
by this, we give several practical principles that lead to better downstream
performance. We analytically prove this trend in an overparamterized linear
setting and verify its applicability to different experimental settings.

assess the learning and inferential utility of the synthetic data by comparing
the accuracy in the prediction of the hypertension status and variational

we use a simulated dataset from a nonlinear model to compare the results from
variational inference (VI) based on privacy-preserving synthetic data, and
privacy-preserving VI obtained from directly privatizing NFs for VI with DP
guarantees given the original non-private dataset. The results suggest that
synthetic data generated through differentially private density estimation with
NF can yield good utility at a reasonable privacy cost. We also show that VI
obtained from differentially private NF based on the free energy bound loss may
produce variational approximations with significantly altered correlation

quasi-two-dimensional emulsion system. The compression is driven by evaporation
of the continuous phase, and causes the area packing fraction to increase from
0.88 to 0.99. We quantify the structural heterogeneity of the system using the
radical Voronoi tessellation following the method of [Rieser et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 116, 088001 (2016)]. We define two structural quantities characterizing
local structure, the first which considers nearest neighbors and the second of
which includes information from second nearest neighbors. We find that droplets
in heterogeneous local regions are more likely to have local rearrangements.
These rearrangements are generally T1 events where two droplets converge toward
a void, and two droplets move away from the void to make room for the
converging droplets. Thus the presence of the voids tends to orient the T1
events. The presence of a correlation between the structural quantities and the
rearrangement dynamics remains qualitatively unchanged over the entire range of
packing fractions observed.

way, the train can figure out the status of potential obstacles with respect to
its route and hence, make a timely decision. Numerous studies have successfully
extracted all rail tracks as a whole within forward-looking images without
considering element instances. Still, some image-based methods have employed
hard-coded prior knowledge of railway geometry on 3D data to associate
left-right rails and generate rail route instances. However, we propose a rail
path extraction pipeline in which left-right rail pixels of each rail route
instance are extracted and associated through a fully convolutional
encoder-decoder architecture called TPE-Net. Two different regression branches
for TPE-Net are proposed to regress the locations of center points of each rail
route, along with their corresponding left-right pixels. Extracted rail pixels
are then spatially clustered to generate topological information of all the
possible train routes (ego-paths), discarding non-ego-path ones. Experimental
results on a challenging, publicly released benchmark show true-positive-pixel
level average precision and recall of 0.9207 and 0.8721, respectively, at about
12 frames per second. Even though our evaluation results are not higher than
the SOTA, the proposed regression pipeline performs remarkably in extracting
the correspondences by looking once at the image. It generates strong rail
route hypotheses without reliance on camera parameters, 3D data, and

scaling constants from low angle to high angle boundaries, which is responsible
for the apparent exceptional scaling behavior found in aluminum. An analysis of

housing, where either government intervention or the economic nature of the
asset is assumed to limit large falls in prices. The observed asset price is
modelled by a geometric Brownian motion (the 'notional price') reflected at a
lower barrier. The resulting observed price has standard dynamics but with
localised intervention at the barrier, which allows arbitrage with interim
losses; this is funded by the government's unlimited powers of intervention,
and its exploitation is subject to credit constraints. Despite the lack of an
equivalent martingale measure for the observed price, options on this price can
be expressed as compound options on the arbitrage-free notional price, to which
standard risk-neutral arguments can be applied. Because option deltas tend to
zero when the observed price approaches the barrier, hedging with the observed
price gives the same results as hedging with the notional price, and so exactly
replicates option payoffs. Hedging schemes are not unique, with the cheapest
scheme for any derivative being the one which best exploits the interventions
at the barrier. The price of a put is clear: direct replication has a lower
initial cost than synthetic replication, and the replication portfolio always
has positive value. The price of a call is ambiguous: synthetic replication has
a lower initial cost than direct replication, but the replication portfolio may
give interim losses, and so the preferred replication strategy (and hence
price) of a call may depend on what margin payments need to be made on these
losses.

a natural transition. At a high angle of attack, vortex shedding and a laminar
separation bubble (LSB) occur on the suction side. The LSB triggers the flow
transition for both the forced and natural transition cases. The wavelet
thresholding and denoising algorithm is used to decompose the pressure fields
into the coherent or denoised pressure and the incoherent or background noise
pressure. This denoising technique provides a clear picture of true noise
generation and propagation. It also reveals the dominant noise source at
specific frequencies when multiple noise sources are present. In another usage,
the wavelet thresholding algorithm with down-sampling separates noise on the
basis of flow structures. For example, the wavelet method separates noise
between low-frequency vortex shedding noise and high-frequency LSB noise as
well as trailing-edge noise. Finally, the wavelet transform is used to
decompose the hydrodynamic and acoustic pressure components near the surface
using the coherence between near-field pressure and far-field pressure.
Overall, the wavelet-based decomposition is a valuable tool to study and reveal
the mechanisms of airfoil noise generation.

performance, ReLU activations can fall victim to the dead neuron problem. In
these cases, the weights feeding into a neuron end up being pushed into a state
where the neuron outputs zero for all inputs. Consequently, the gradient is
also zero for all inputs, which means that the weights which feed into the
neuron cannot update. The neuron is not able to recover from direct back
propagation and model capacity is reduced as those parameters can no longer be
further optimized. Inspired by a neurological process of the same name, we
introduce Synaptic Stripping as a means to combat this dead neuron problem. By
automatically removing problematic connections during training, we can
regenerate dead neurons and significantly improve model capacity and parametric
utilization. Synaptic Stripping is easy to implement and results in sparse

members often share network structure in order to avoid training several
independent models from scratch. Diversity is traditionally analyzed by
measuring differences between the outputs of models. However, this gives little
insight into how knowledge representations differ between ensemble members.
This paper introduces several interpretability methods that can be used to
qualitatively analyze diversity. We demonstrate these techniques by comparing
the diversity of feature representations between child networks using two
low-cost ensemble algorithms, Snapshot Ensembles and Prune and Tune Ensembles.
We use the same pre-trained parent network as a starting point for both methods

modern NNIP models exhibit small differences in energy/forces errors,
improvements in accuracy are still considered the main target when developing
new NNIP architectures. In this work, we show how architectural and
optimization choices influence the generalization of NNIPs, revealing trends in
molecular dynamics (MD) stability, data efficiency, and loss landscapes. Using
the 3BPA dataset, we show that test errors in NNIP follow a scaling relation
and can be robust to noise, but cannot predict MD stability in the
high-accuracy regime. To circumvent this problem, we propose the use of loss
landscape visualizations and a metric of loss entropy for predicting the
generalization power of NNIPs. With a large-scale study on NequIP and MACE, we
show that the loss entropy predicts out-of-distribution error and MD stability
despite being computed only on the training set. Using this probe, we
demonstrate how the choice of optimizers, loss function weighting, data
normalization, and other architectural decisions influence the extrapolation
behavior of NNIPs. Finally, we relate loss entropy to data efficiency,
demonstrating that flatter landscapes also predict learning curve slopes. Our

the maximum multicast gain. The main drawback of most existing CDC schemes is
that they require the original data to be split into a large number of input
files that grows exponentially with $K$, which can significantly increase the
coding complexity and degrade system performance. In this paper, we first use a
classic combinatorial structure $t$-design, for any integer $t\geq 2$, to
develop a low-complexity and asymptotically optimal CDC with $r=s$. The main
advantages of our scheme via $t$-design are two-fold: 1) having much smaller
$N$ and $Q$ than the existing schemes under the same parameters $K$, $r$ and
$s$; and 2) achieving smaller communication loads compared with the
state-of-the-art schemes. Remarkably, unlike the previous schemes that realize
on large operation fields, our scheme operates on the minimum binary field
$\mathbb{F}_2$. Furthermore, we show that our construction method can
incorporate the other combinatorial structures that have a similar property to
$t$-design. For instance, we use $t$-GDD to obtain another asymptotically
optimal CDC scheme over $\mathbb{F}_2$ that has different parameters from
$t$-design. Finally, we show that our construction method can also be used to
construct CDC schemes with $r\neq s$ that have small file number and Reduce

costs too much time for training and the performance of the trained agent may
not be satisfactory. In order to solve these problems, the method based on
curriculum learning is proposed. First, three curricula of air combat maneuver
decision-making are designed: angle curriculum, distance curriculum and hybrid
curriculum. These courses are used to train air combat agents respectively, and
compared with the original method without any curriculum. The training results
show that angle curriculum can increase the speed and stability of training,
and improve the performance of the agent; distance curriculum can increase the
speed and stability of agent training; hybrid curriculum has a negative impact
on training, because it makes the agent get stuck at local optimum. The
simulation results show that after training, the agent can handle the
situations where targets come from different directions, and the maneuver
decision results are consistent with the characteristics of missile.

  Second, this paper studies weak measurements (WM) and presents a WM-based

  Matching",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Local feature matching is an essential component in many visual applications.
In this work, we propose OAMatcher, a Tranformer-based detector-free method
that imitates humans behavior to generate dense and accurate matches. Firstly,
OAMatcher predicts overlapping areas to promote effective and clean global
context aggregation, with the key insight that humans focus on the overlapping
areas instead of the entire images after multiple observations when matching
keypoints in image pairs. Technically, we first perform global information
integration across all keypoints to imitate the humans behavior of observing
the entire images at the beginning of feature matching. Then, we propose
Overlapping Areas Prediction Module (OAPM) to capture the keypoints in
co-visible regions and conduct feature enhancement among them to simulate that
humans transit the focus regions from the entire images to overlapping regions,
hence realizeing effective information exchange without the interference coming
from the keypoints in non overlapping areas. Besides, since humans tend to
leverage probability to determine whether the match labels are correct or not,
we propose a Match Labels Weight Strategy (MLWS) to generate the coefficients
used to appraise the reliability of the ground-truth match labels, while
alleviating the influence of measurement noise coming from the data. Moreover,
we integrate depth-wise convolution into Tranformer encoder layers to ensure
OAMatcher extracts local and global feature representation concurrently.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that OAMatcher outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, while exhibiting excellent
robustness to extreme appearance variants. The source code is available at

i.e., directly generating a molecule with a 3D structure and binding position

VD-Gen, a novel pocket-based 3D molecular generation pipeline. VD-Gen consists
of several carefully designed stages to generate fine-grained 3D molecules with
binding positions in the pocket cavity end-to-end. Rather than directly
generating or sampling atoms with 3D positions in the pocket like in early
attempts, in VD-Gen, we first randomly initialize many virtual particles in the
pocket; then iteratively move these virtual particles, making the distribution
of virtual particles approximate the distribution of molecular atoms. After
virtual particles are stabilized in 3D space, we extract a 3D molecule from
them. Finally, we further refine atoms in the extracted molecule by iterative
movement again, to get a high-quality 3D molecule, and predict a confidence
score for it. Extensive experiment results on pocket-based molecular generation
demonstrate that VD-Gen can generate novel 3D molecules to fill the target
pocket cavity with high binding affinities, significantly outperforming
previous baselines.

to be of the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle type, which
will operate out of vertiports. While this is akin to the relationship between
general aviation aircraft and airports, the conceived location of vertiports
within dense urban environments presents unique challenges in managing the air
traffic served by a vertiport. This challenge becomes pronounced within
increasing frequency of scheduled landings and take-offs. This paper assumes a
centralized air traffic controller (ATC) to explore the performance of a new AI
driven ATC approach to manage the eVTOLs served by the vertiport. Minimum
separation-driven safety and delays are the two important considerations in
this case. The ATC problem is modeled as a task allocation problem, and
uncertainties due to communication disruptions (e.g., poor link quality) and
inclement weather (e.g., high gust effects) are added as a small probability of
action failures. To learn the vertiport ATC policy, a novel graph-based
reinforcement learning (RL) solution called ""Urban Air Mobility- Vertiport
Schedule Management (UAM-VSM)"" is developed. This approach uses graph
convolutional networks (GCNs) to abstract the vertiport space and eVTOL space
as graphs, and aggregate information for a centralized ATC agent to help
generalize the environment. Unreal Engine combined with Airsim is used as the
simulation environment over which training and testing occurs. Uncertainties
are considered only during testing, due to the high cost of Mc sampling over
such realistic simulations. The proposed graph RL method demonstrates
significantly better performance on the test scenarios when compared against a
feasible random decision-making baseline and a first come first serve (FCFS)
baseline, including the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and with
uncertainties.

established in the literature. However, most of the studies require the input
dimension to be fixed and consequently ignore the effect of dimension on the
rate of convergence and hamper their applications to modern big data with high
dimensionality. In this paper, we bridge this gap by analyzing a $k^{th}$ order
nonparametric interaction model in both growing dimension scenarios ($d$ grows
with $n$ but at a slower rate) and in high dimension ($d \gtrsim n$). In the
latter case, sparsity assumptions and associated regularization are required in
order to obtain optimal rates of convergence. A new challenge in diverging
dimension setting is in calculation mean-square error, the covariance terms
among estimated additive components are an order of magnitude larger than those
of the variances and they can deteriorate statistical properties without proper
care. We introduce a critical debiasing technique to amend the problem. We show
that under certain standard assumptions, debiased deep neural networks achieve
a minimax optimal rate both in terms of $(n, d)$. Our proof techniques rely
crucially on a novel debiasing technique that makes the covariances of additive
components negligible in the mean-square error calculation. In addition, we

multi-typed behaviors (e.g., click, add-to-cart, and purchase). Traditional
collaborative filtering techniques typically assume that users only have a
single type of behavior with items, making it insufficient to utilize complex
collaborative signals to learn informative representations and infer actual
user preferences. Consequently, some pioneer studies explore modeling
multi-behavior heterogeneity to learn better representations and boost the
performance of recommendations for a target behavior. However, a large number
of auxiliary behaviors (i.e., click and add-to-cart) could introduce irrelevant
information to recommenders, which could mislead the target behavior (i.e.,
purchase) recommendation, rendering two critical challenges: (i) denoising
auxiliary behaviors and (ii) bridging the semantic gap between auxiliary and
target behaviors. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel
framework-Denoising and Prompt-Tuning (DPT) with a three-stage learning
paradigm to solve the aforementioned challenges. In particular, DPT is equipped
with a pattern-enhanced graph encoder in the first stage to learn complex
patterns as prior knowledge in a data-driven manner to guide learning
informative representation and pinpointing reliable noise for subsequent
stages. Accordingly, we adopt different lightweight tuning approaches with
effectiveness and efficiency in the following stages to further attenuate the
influence of noise and alleviate the semantic gap among multi-typed behaviors.
Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of
DPT over a wide range of state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code is

The estimator in our loss function favors the pairs that preserve the norm of

completion. This paper also proposes an algorithm known as SPTC (Smooth Poisson
Tensor Completion) for nonnegative integer tensor completion as an
instantiation of the GCDTC framework. A series of experiments on real-world

to current state-of-the-art methods. Related code is available in the

such as the classical gradient-flow regime of vanishing learning rate, the
high-dimensional regime of large input dimension, and the overparameterised

regimes where the limiting dynamics is determined by the interplay between
these behaviours. In particular, in the high-dimensional limit, the
infinite-width dynamics is found to remain close to a low-dimensional subspace

models are too computationally intensive to consider multi-year timescales.
Increasingly, unsupervised machine learning techniques are used to identify a
small number of representative weather patterns to simulate long-term
behaviour. Here we develop a novel wind energy workflow that for the first time
combines weather patterns derived from unsupervised clustering techniques with
numerical weather prediction models (here WRF) to obtain efficient and accurate
long-term predictions of power and downstream wakes from an entire wind farm.
We use ERA5 reanalysis data clustering not only on low altitude pressure but
also, for the first time, on the more relevant variable of wind velocity. We
also compare the use of large-scale and local-scale domains for clustering. A
WRF simulation is run at each of the cluster centres and the results are
aggregated using a novel post-processing technique. By applying our workflow to
two different regions, we show that our long-term predictions agree with those
from a year of WRF simulations but require less than 2% of the computational
time. The most accurate results are obtained when clustering on wind velocity.
Moreover, clustering over the Europe-wide domain is sufficient for predicting
wind farm power output, but downstream wake predictions benefit from the use of
smaller domains. Finally, we show that these downstream wakes can affect the
local weather patterns.
  Our approach facilitates multi-year predictions of power output and
downstream farm wakes, by providing a fast, accurate and flexible methodology
that is applicable to any global region. Moreover, these accurate long-term
predictions of downstream wakes provide the first tool to help mitigate the
effects of wind energy loss downstream of wind farms, since they can be used to
determine optimum wind farm locations.

  In this paper, we exhaustively investigate the adversarial attack algorithms

mainly disrupt the importance distribution of words in a text. A well-trained
model can distinguish subtle importance distribution differences between clean
and adversarial texts. Based on this intuition, we propose TextDefense, a new
adversarial example detection framework that utilizes the target model's
capability to defend against adversarial attacks while requiring no prior

target model for detection and thus is attack type agnostic. Our extensive
experiments show that TextDefense can be applied to different architectures,
datasets, and attack methods and outperforms existing methods. We also discover
that the leading factor influencing the performance of TextDefense is the
target model's generalizability. By analyzing the property of the target model

motivated suggestions that they have uniform-temperature carbon atmospheres
(UTCAs), which adequately fit their spectra with appropriate neutron star (NS)
surface areas. This is in contrast to the two-temperature blackbody or hydrogen
atmospheres that also fit well. Here we investigate the applicability of UTCAs
to CCOs. We show the following: (i) The phase-averaged spectra of the three
pulsed CCOs can also be fitted with a UTCA of the appropriate NS area, despite
pulsed CCOs manifestly having non-uniform surface temperature. A good spectral
fit is therefore not strong support for the UTCA model of unpulsed CCOs. (ii)
An improved spectrum of one unpulsed CCO, previously analyzed with a UTCA, does
not allow an acceptable fit. (iii) For two unpulsed CCOs, the UTCA does not
allow a distance compatible with the SNR distance. These results imply that, in
general, CCOs must have hot, localized regions on the NS surface. We derive new
X-ray pulse modulation upper limits on the unpulsed CCOs, and constrain their
hot spot sizes and locations. We develop an alternative model that accounts for
both the pulsed and unpulsed CCOs: a range of angles between hot spot and
rotation axes consistent with an exponential distribution with scale factor
$\lambda \sim 20^{\circ}$. We discuss physical mechanisms that could produce
such small angles and small hot-spots.

We show here that this 'genuinely non-classical reduction of entropy as a

spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and observations of large-scale

Universe evolve from a relativistic phase at very early times to a
massive-particle behavior at later times. The mass of neutrinos affects the
history of the expansion of the universe and the growth of the disturbances of
the various components of the cosmic microwave background, therefore the
anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic radiation and the observations of the
large-scale structures. In this article, by using the coupling of neutrinos
with dark energy, we investigate the cosmic evolution from the era of matter
dominated to the era of dark energy dominated and show that neutrinos can play
an important role in the evolution from radiation dominated to matter dominated
and the evolution from Matter dominated to dark energy dominated. Also, we
investigate the effect of non-relativistic neutrino on bulk flow and show that
the direction of bulk flow has a little difference in scales smaller than 0.1,
and the more we consider the scales higher than the local universe, the more
difference is observed in the direction of bulk flow.

This is done in a way that still allows large parts of the course to be common

  Background: Many first-year engineering students perceive mathematics courses
as being too abstract and far from their chosen study programme. This may lead
to a lack of motivation and effort, thus decreasing the learning outcomes.
  Intended outcomes: That engineering students recognize that the calculus and
linear algebra courses are relevant for their future work within their specific
field. This is intended to improve their learning outcomes.
  Application design: The courses have been restructured into smaller subunits,
each of which has a corresponding workshop treating a real-world problem from
the specific field of a given group of students. These workshops are developed
in consultation with the relevant fields of study, and they are given a
prominent role in the course for instance by forming the basis for the oral
exams.
  Findings: Based on the feedback from students, we find that inclusion of
field specific problems does help to highlight the applicability and importance
of mathematics in engineering. When implementing such a solution, however,
there are a number of challenges to keep in mind.

Using centralised learning (CL) enables MARL agents to quickly learn how to

CL only where necessary and vastly reducing the computational burden of CL. Our

finding saddle points on the surface that describes how the energy of the
system varies as a function of the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach
has several advantages over commonly used methods especially in the context of
density functional calculations, as collapse to the ground state is avoided and
yet, the orbitals are variationally optimized for the excited state. This
optimization makes it possible to describe excitations with large charge
transfer where calculations based on ground state orbitals are problematic, as
in linear response time-dependent density functional theory. A generalized mode
following method is presented where an $n^{\text{th}}$-order saddle point is
found by inverting the components of the gradient in the direction of the
eigenvectors of the $n$ lowest eigenvalues of the electronic Hessian matrix.
This approach has the distinct advantage of following a chosen excited state
through atomic configurations where the symmetry of the single determinant wave
function is broken, as demonstrated in calculations of potential energy curves
for nuclear motion in the ethylene and dihydrogen molecules. The method is
implemented using a generalized Davidson algorithm and an exponential
transformation for updating the orbitals within a generalized gradient
approximation of the energy functional. Convergence is found to be more robust
than for a direct optimization approach previously shown to outperform standard
self-consistent field approaches, as illustrated here for charge transfer
excitations in nitrobenzene and N-phenylpyrrole, involving calculations of
$4^{\text{th}}$- and $6^{\text{th}}$-order saddle points, respectively.
Finally, calculations of a diplatinum and silver complex are presented,
illustrating the applicability of the method to excited state energy curves of

activities from complex data. The recent development and success in AI,

From a methodological point of view, machine learning based fraud detection can
be divided into two categories, i.e., conventional methods (decision tree,
boosting...) and deep learning, both of which have significant limitations in
terms of the lack of representation learning ability for the former and
interpretability for the latter. Furthermore, due to the rarity of detected
fraud cases, the associated data is usually imbalanced, which seriously
degrades the performance of classification algorithms. In this paper, we
propose deep boosting decision trees (DBDT), a novel approach for fraud
detection based on gradient boosting and neural networks. In order to combine
the advantages of both conventional methods and deep learning, we first
construct soft decision tree (SDT), a decision tree structured model with
neural networks as its nodes, and then ensemble SDTs using the idea of gradient
boosting. In this way we embed neural networks into gradient boosting to
improve its representation learning capability and meanwhile maintain the
interpretability. Furthermore, aiming at the rarity of detected fraud cases, in
the model training phase we propose a compositional AUC maximization approach
to deal with data imbalances at algorithm level. Extensive experiments on
several real-life fraud detection datasets show that DBDT can significantly
improve the performance and meanwhile maintain good interpretability. Our code

observations of one of the brightest gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) GRB 160625B with
the detailed continuous fast optical photometry of its optical counterpart
obtained by MASTER and with hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission, obtained by the
Lomonosov and Konus-Wind spacecraft. The detailed photometry led us to detect
the quasi-periodical emission components in the intrinsic optical emission. As
a result of our analysis of synchronous multiwavelength observations, we
propose a three-stage collapse scenario for this long and bright GRB. We
suggest that quasiperiodic fluctuations may be associated with forced
precession of a self-gravitating rapidly rotating superdense body (spinar),
whose evolution is determined by a powerful magnetic field. The spinar's mass
allows it to collapse into a black hole at the end of evolution.

central star. In an earlier study, computing the growth of planets by
continuous accretion, we found that a large fraction of the ice evaporates upon
accretion, creating a water vapor atmosphere. Here we consider accretion as a
discrete series of planetesimal impacts (of order $10^8$), at the same
time-dependent accretion rate, and investigate the fate of the vapor, as a
result of its interaction with the accreting planetesimals. We find that a
large fraction of the vapor escapes. The remaining fraction may form an outer
layer of ice after the termination of accretion and cooling of the surface. The
escaped water mass may significantly alter the ice-to-rock ratio of the planet.
We investigate the effect of different choices of parameters such as the
ice-to-rock ratio, the planetesimal size distribution, and the impact
velocities. We find that the planetesimal size distribution has a negligible
effect and explain why. By contrast, the ice-to-rock ratio and impact
velocities affect the fraction of retained water masses considerably.

i.e., internally, by computing the variance of the CNNs outputs and then
propagating the uncertainty through the post-processing, and externally, by
associating the final predictions of different samples and computing the
covariance of each predicted box. In experiments, we show that the external
uncertainty estimation leads to better results, outperforming both internal
uncertainty estimation and classical tracking approaches. Furthermore, we
propose a method to initialize the Variational 3D object detector with a

  Fault Diagnosis under Limited Fault Data",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intelligent fault diagnosis has made extraordinary advancements currently.
Nonetheless, few works tackle class-incremental learning for fault diagnosis
under limited fault data, i.e., imbalanced and long-tailed fault diagnosis,
which brings about various notable challenges. Initially, it is difficult to
extract discriminative features from limited fault data. Moreover, a
well-trained model must be retrained from scratch to classify the samples from
new classes, thus causing a high computational burden and time consumption.
Furthermore, the model may suffer from catastrophic forgetting when trained
incrementally. Finally, the model decision is biased toward the new classes due
to the class imbalance. The problems can consequently lead to performance
degradation of fault diagnosis models. Accordingly, we introduce a supervised
contrastive knowledge distillation for incremental fault diagnosis under
limited fault data (SCLIFD) framework to address these issues, which extends
the classical incremental classifier and representation learning (iCaRL)
framework from three perspectives. Primarily, we adopt supervised contrastive
knowledge distillation (KD) to enhance its representation learning capability
under limited fault data. Moreover, we propose a novel prioritized exemplar
selection method adaptive herding (AdaHerding) to restrict the increase of the
computational burden, which is also combined with KD to alleviate catastrophic
forgetting. Additionally, we adopt the cosine classifier to mitigate the
adverse impact of class imbalance. We conduct extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world industrial processes under different imbalance ratios.
Experimental results show that our SCLIFD outperforms the existing methods by a
large margin.

down-type quarks, charged leptons and Dirac neutrinos. A $SO(2)_{LR}^f$ flavor
symmetry is found from the hierarchy masses of quarks and leptons, which
dominated CKM mixing for quarks and PMNS for leptons. Since the minimal flavor
structure successfully addresses CKM and PMNS even in the mass hierarchy limit,
mass hierarchy and flavor mixing are two independent questions. As a
prediction, a sum rule on the mixing angles and CP violation phase is
suggested, which explains the smallness of $s_{13}$ as a natural result of the
mass hierarchy. Generalizing the flat structure to quarks and leptons, a
unified Yukawa interaction is achieved for all fermions with only a single

electronic states, fundamental to command the quantum behavior of materials,
relies on the existence of discrete translational symmetry of the crystalline
lattice. In contrast, in the absence of long-range order, as in the case of
non-crystalline materials, the electronic states are localized and electronic
coherence does not develop. This brings forward the fundamental question
whether long range order is necessary condition to establish coherence and
structured momentum-dependent electronic state, and how to characterize it in
the presence of short-range order. Here we study Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a material that
exists in its crystalline form with long range order, in amorphous form, with
short and medium range order, and in its nanocrystalline form, with reduced
short range order. By using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to
directly access the electronic states in a momentum resolved manner, we reveal
that, even in the absence of long-range order, a well-defined real-space length
scale is sufficient to produce dispersive band structures. Moreover, we observe
for the first time a repeated Fermi surface structure of duplicated annuli,
reminiscent of Brillouin zone-like repetitions. These results, together with
our simulations using amorphous Hamiltonians, reveal that the typical momentum
scale where coherence occurs is the inverse average nearest-neighbor distance,
the direct fingerprint of the local order of the underlying atomic structure.
These results, not only lead the way to a new understanding of electronic
coherence in solids, but also open the way to the realization of novel
momentum-dependent quantum phenomena such as momentum pairing and spin-orbit

DRAM peripherals to accelerate various data-centric applications. Several
DRAM-based PIM accelerators for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also
been reported. Among these, the accelerators leveraging in-DRAM stochastic
arithmetic have shown manifold improvements in processing latency and
throughput, due to the ability of stochastic arithmetic to convert
multiplications into simple bit-wise logical AND operations. However,the use of
in-DRAM stochastic arithmetic for CNN acceleration requires frequent stochastic
to binary number conversions. For that, prior works employ full adder-based or

sample-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) from pixels. Unfortunately, in
real-world scenarios, representation learning is usually fragile to
task-irrelevant distractions such as variations in background or viewpoint. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel clustering-based approach, namely
Clustering with Bisimulation Metrics (CBM), which learns robust representations
by grouping visual observations in the latent space. Specifically, CBM
alternates between two steps: (1) grouping observations by measuring their
bisimulation distances to the learned prototypes; (2) learning a set of
prototypes according to the current cluster assignments. Computing cluster
assignments with bisimulation metrics enables CBM to capture task-relevant
information, as bisimulation metrics quantify the behavioral similarity between
observations. Moreover, CBM encourages the consistency of representations
within each group, which facilitates filtering out task-irrelevant information
and thus induces robust representations against distractions. An appealing
feature is that CBM can achieve sample-efficient representation learning even
if multiple distractions exist simultaneously.Experiments demonstrate that CBM
significantly improves the sample efficiency of popular visual RL algorithms
and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both multiple and single
distraction settings. The code is available at

securely store and apply secret keys without giving a potential attacker the
possibility to access them neither by software nor hardware attacks. In 2002,
the concept of Physical Unclonable Function emerged to counteract the inherent
threats, associated with this trend. Physical disordered systems are excited by
external stimuli and can thereby be uniquely identified. 2D materials have
profoundly different characteristics when isolated from their bulk form to few-

to choose whether to kick either first or second on all five rounds of penalty
kicks, when each team is allowed one kick per round. There is considerable
evidence that the right to make this choice, which is usually to kick first,
gives a team a significant advantage. To make the outcome of a tied game
fairer, we suggest a rule that handicaps the team that kicks first (A),
requiring it to succeed on one more penalty kick than the team that kicks
second (B). We call this the $m - n$ rule and, more specifically, propose $(m,
n)$ = (5, 4): For A to win, it must successfully kick 5 goals before the end of
the round in which B kicks its 4th; for B to win, it must succeed on 4 penalty
kicks before A succeeds on 5. If both teams reach (5, 4) on the same round --
when they both kick successfully at (4, 3) -- then the game is decided by
round-by-round ""sudden death,"" whereby the winner is the first team to score in
a subsequent round when the other team does not. We show that this rule is fair
in tending to equalize the ability of each team to win a tied game in a penalty

to a point, called the virtual pivot point (VPP), of a 2D biped robot, which is
located above the CoM of the model, to generate a restoring moment for the
trunk motion. The resulting behavior of the model would resemble a virtual
pendulum rotating around this VPP, thus aiming for an upright trunk during
walking. Inspired by this analysis, we propose a new force redirecting method
as a controller for robot walking. Then, these key features of the BTSLIP model
with a simple force direction controller are mapped into the overall input
torques of an articulated body robot via a task space controller. We consider a
full dynamic simulation of a 2D articulated body robot to validate the
performance of the proposed method under the random initial conditions and the
presence of force disturbances and moderately rough surfaces. Moreover, with
our control strategy, the robot achieves a stable walking motion while keeping
its upper body upright without using optimization methods. We hypothesize by
taking the advantage of the properties of mechanical templates, also called the
reduced-order model, this could enable stable gait for the full model robot

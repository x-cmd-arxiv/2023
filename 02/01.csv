Because
those choices are external to the data-generating process, each choice leads to
an exact symmetry, corresponding to the group of transformations that takes one
possible representation to another. These are the passive symmetries; they
include coordinate freedom, gauge symmetry and units covariance, all of which
have led to important results in physics. Our goal is to understand the
implications of passive symmetries for machine learning: Which passive
symmetries play a role (e.g., permutation symmetry in graph neural networks)?
What are dos and don'ts in machine learning practice? We assay conditions under
which passive symmetries can be implemented as group equivariances. We also
discuss links to causal modeling, and argue that the implementation of passive
symmetries is particularly valuable when the goal of the learning problem is to
generalize out of sample. While this paper is purely conceptual, we believe
that it can have a significant impact on helping machine learning make the
transition that took place for modern physics in the first half of the
Twentieth century.

magnets with topologically non-trivial degeneracies. However, identifying the
specific band structure features like Weyl points, nodal lines or planes which
generate the anomalous response is a challenging issue. Since the low-energy
interband transitions can govern the static AHE, we addressed this question in
the prototypical magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ also hosting nodal
lines by broadband polarized reflectivity and magneto-optical Kerr effect
spectroscopy with a focus on the far-infrared range. In the linear dichroism
spectrum we observe a strong resonance at 40\,meV, which also shows up in the
optical Hall conductivity spectrum and primarily determines the static AHE,
thus, confirms its intrinsic origin. Our material-specific theory reproduces
the experimental data remarkably well and shows that strongly tilted nodal line
segments around the Fermi energy generate the resonance. While the Weyl points
only give vanishing contributions, these segments of the nodal lines gapped by
the spin-orbit coupling dominate the low-energy optical response.

universal behaviour of different observables, especially the thermal and the
order-parameter critical exponents, are computed by Monte-Carlo techniques for
$q=1,2,3$-Potts models for different values of the power-law decaying exponent
$a$. On the basis of our conclusions, which are in agreement with previous

driven to a fixed point at finite or infinite long-range disorder depending on
the values of $q$ and $a$. Finally, we discuss the role of the higher cumulants
of the disorder distribution. This is done by drawning the auxiliary

the infinite disorder fixed point, that certain universal effects are affected

flows are often characterised by coherent spatiotemporal structures, such as

turbulent flows. However, current approaches are often limited by either the
need to use some form of thresholding on quantities defining the isosurfaces to
which the flow structures are associated or the linearity of traditional modal
flow decomposition approaches, such as those based on proper orthogonal
decomposition. This problem is exacerbated in flows that exhibit extreme
events, which are rare and sudden changes in a turbulent state. The goal of
this paper is to obtain an efficient and accurate reduced-order latent
representation of a turbulent flow that exhibits extreme events. Specifically,
we employ a three-dimensional multiscale convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to
obtain such latent representation. We apply it to a three-dimensional turbulent
flow. We show that the Multiscale CAE is efficient, requiring less than 10%
degrees of freedom than proper orthogonal decomposition for compressing the

To get an accurate estimate, MC methods consume massive online samples. When
online samples are expensive, e.g., online recommendations and inventory
management, we want to reduce the number of online samples while achieving the

design a tailored behavior policy such that the variance of the off-policy MC

tailored behavior policy can be efficiently learned from existing offline data,

expansion $\widehat{\mathscr{C}}$ of $\mathscr{C}$, one cannot interpret, in
first-order logic, arbitrarily long linear orders in graphs from
$\widehat{\mathscr{C}}$. It is known that nowhere dense graph classes are
monadically stable; these encompass most of the studied concepts of sparsity in
graphs, including graph classes that exclude a fixed topological minor. On the
other hand, monadic stability is a property expressed in purely model-theoretic
terms and hence it is also suited for capturing structure in dense graphs.
  For several years, it has been suspected that one can create a structure
theory for monadically stable graph classes that mirrors the theory of nowhere
dense graph classes in the dense setting. In this work we provide a step in
this direction by giving a characterization of monadic stability through the
Flipper game: a game on a graph played by Flipper, who in each round can
complement the edge relation between any pair of vertex subsets, and Connector,
who in each round localizes the game to a ball of bounded radius. This is an
analog of the Splitter game, which characterizes nowhere dense classes of
graphs (Grohe, Kreutzer, and Siebertz, J.ACM'17).
  We give two different proofs of our main result. The first proof uses tools
from model theory, and it exposes an additional property of monadically stable
graph classes that is close in spirit to definability of types. Also, as a
byproduct, we give an alternative proof of the recent result of Braunfeld and
Laskowski (arXiv 2209.05120) that monadic stability for graph classes coincides
with existential monadic stability. The second proof relies on the recently
introduced notion of flip-wideness (Dreier, M\""ahlmann, Siebertz, and
Toru\'nczyk, arXiv 2206.13765) and provides an efficient algorithm to compute
Flipper's moves in a winning strategy.

the cooling of hot electrons in moir\'e graphene using time- and
frequency-resolved photovoltage measurements as a direct probe of its complex
energy pathways including electron-phonon coupling. We report on a dramatic
speedup in hot carrier cooling of twisted bilayer graphene near the magic

whereas in pristine graphene coupling to acoustic phonons takes nanoseconds.
Our analysis indicates that this ultrafast cooling is a combined effect of the
formation of a superlattice with low-energy moir\'e phonons, spatially

zone, enabling Umklapp scattering that overcomes electron-phonon momentum
mismatch. These results demonstrate a way to engineer electron-phonon coupling

improvement in tackling those problems. Nevertheless, as a fundamental
challenge in image translation, the problem of Zero-shot-Learning
Cross-Modality Data Translation with fidelity remains unanswered. This paper
proposes a new unsupervised zero-shot-learning method named Mutual Information
guided Diffusion cross-modality data translation Model (MIDiffusion), which
learns to translate the unseen source data to the target domain. The
MIDiffusion leverages a score-matching-based generative model, which learns the
prior knowledge in the target domain. We propose a differentiable
local-wise-MI-Layer ($LMI$) for conditioning the iterative denoising sampling.
The $LMI$ captures the identical cross-modality features in the statistical
domain for the diffusion guidance; thus, our method does not require retraining

mechanics, endowing crack fronts in a brittle solid with Steigmann-Ogden
surface elasticity yields a model that predicts bounded strains at the crack

present in general for anti-plane shear (mode-III fracture) even when
Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity is incorporated. Motivated by obtaining a
model of brittle fracture capable of predicting bounded strains for all modes
of loading, we formulate an exact general theory of a bulk solid containing a
boundary surface with strain-gradient surface elasticity. For planar reference
surfaces, the form of surface elasticity reduces to that introduced by Hilgers
and Pipkin, and when the surface energy is independent of the surface gradient
of the stretching, the theory reduces to that of Steigmann and Ogden. We give a
full discussion of material symmetry using Murdoch and Cohen's extension of
Noll's theory. We present a model quadratic surface energy that incorporates
resistance to geodesic distortion, satisfies strong ellipticity, and requires
the same material constants found in the Steigmann-Ogden theory. Finally, we
derive and apply the linearized theory to mode-III fracture in an infinite
plate. We prove that there always exists a unique classical solution to the
governing integro-differential equation, and in contrast to using
Steigmann-Ogden surface elasticity, our model is consistent with the
linearization assumption in predicting finite strains at the crack tips.

response of a stack of slabs in contact through dry frictional interfaces

synchronization. A sufficiently high stiffness ratio leads to synchronization,
comprising periodic slip events in which all interfaces slip simultaneously. A
lower stiffness ratio leads to asynchronous slips and, experimentally, to the
stick-slip amplitude being broadly distributed as the number of layers in the
stack increases. We interpret this broadening in light of the combined effect
of surface disorder, complex loading paths of the asynchronous slips, and
creep. Consequently, the ageing rate can be readily extracted from the
stick-slip cycle. The extracted aging rate is found to be of the same order of

two topics: first, the differences of the shadows of the naked rotating

the particles falling from the accretion disk. Our findings are as follows:
around the naked singularity, the non-equatorial prograde orbits in the in Kerr
black hole remain intact up to a critical rotation parameter
($\alpha=\frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3\sqrt{3}}$) and cease to exist above this value.
This has an important consequence in the shadow of the naked singularity if the
shadow is registered by an observer on the rotation plane or close to it as the
shadow cannot be distinguished from that of a Kerr black hole viewed from the
same angle. We also show that the timelike retrograde orbits in the equatorial
plane immediately (after about an 8% increase in mass) reduce the spin
parameter of the naked singularity from larger values to $\alpha=1$ at which an
event horizon appears. This happens because the retrograde orbits have a larger
capture cross-section than the prograde ones. So if a naked singularity happens
to have an accretion disk, it will not remain naked for long, an event horizon
forms.

maximize the likelihood of each token in the ground-truth sequence conditioned
on the previous target tokens. However, during inference, the model needs to
make a prediction conditioned on the tokens generated by itself. This
train-test discrepancy is referred to as exposure bias. Scheduled sampling is a
curriculum learning strategy that gradually exposes the model to its own
predictions during training to mitigate this bias. Most of the proposed
approaches design a scheduler based on training steps, which generally requires
careful tuning depending on the training setup. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Scheduled Sampling with Imitation Loss (DySI), which maintains the
schedule based solely on the training time accuracy, while enhancing the
curriculum learning by introducing an imitation loss, which attempts to make
the behavior of the decoder indistinguishable from the behavior of a
teacher-forced decoder. DySI is universally applicable across training setups
with minimal tuning. Extensive experiments and analysis show that DySI not only
achieves notable improvements on standard machine translation benchmarks, but
also significantly improves the robustness of other text generation models.

non-thermal dark matter(DM) and its connection with Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) via additional relativistic degrees of freedom which are simultaneously
generated during the period $T_{\rm BBN}~{\rm to}~T_{\rm CMB}$ from a
long-lived dark sector particle. To realize this phenomena we minimally extend
the type-I seesaw scenario with a Dirac fermion singlet($\chi$) and a complex
scalar singlet ($\varphi$) which transform non-trivially under an unbroken
symmetry $\mathcal{Z}_3$. $\chi$ being the lightest particle in the dark sector
acts as a stable dark matter candidate while the next to lightest state
$\varphi$ operates like a long lived dark scalar particle. The initial density
of $\varphi$ can be thermally produced through either self-interacting number
changing processes ($3 \varphi \to 2 \varphi$) within dark sector or the
standard annihilation to SM particles ($2 \varphi \to 2~ {\rm SM}$). The late
time (after neutrino decoupling) non-thermal decay of $\varphi$ can produce
dark matter in association with active neutrinos. The presence of extra
relativistic neutrino degrees of freedom at the time of CMB can have a
significant impact on $\Delta \rm N_{eff}$. Thus the precise measurement of
$\Delta \rm N_{ eff}$ by current PLANCK 2018 collaboration and future
experiments like SPT-3G and CMB-S4 can indirectly probe this non-thermal dark
matter scenario which is otherwise completely secluded due to its tiny coupling
with the standard model.

results. However, the single-step predictors are mostly trained offline to
optimize the single-step accuracy, without considering complete routes. Here,
we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the single-step predictor,
by using a tree-shaped MDP to optimize complete routes. Specifically, we
propose a novel online training algorithm, called Planning with Dual Value

synthesizability and cost of molecules, respectively. To maintain the

increasing the success rate from 85.79% to 98.95% for Retro*, and reducing the

Games, Bottom Responsive, and Anonymous HGs. Then, having a broader view in
mind, we attempt to shed light on the structural properties leading to
learnability/stabilizability, or lack thereof, for specific HGs classes. Along
this path, we focus on the fully expressive Hedonic Coalition Nets
representation of HGs. We identify two sets of conditions that lead to

freedom of choosing an ad hoc adversarial distribution is the most obvious

on $\W$-games, where players have individual preferences over other players and
evaluate coalitions based on the least preferred member. We prove that these

assign positive probability mass to all coalitions. Finally, we discuss why

arbitrary functions inside the program. To protect the control-flow from these
attacks, dedicated fault control-flow integrity (CFI) countermeasures are
commonly deployed. However, these schemes either have high detection latencies
or require intrusive hardware changes. In this paper, we present EC-CFI, a
software-based cryptographically enforced CFI scheme with no detection latency

designed to prevent an adversary from escaping the program's call graph using
faults by encrypting each function with a different key before execution. At
runtime, the instrumented program dynamically derives the decryption key,
ensuring that the code only can be successfully decrypted when the program
follows the intended call graph. To enable this level of protection on Intel

whose vertex set is the set of prime divisors of $|G|$ and in which two
distinct vertices $r$ and $s$ are adjacent if and only if there exists an
element of order $rs$ in $G$.
  A finite group $G$ is called almost recognizable (by Gruenberg-Kegel graph)
if there is only finite number of pairwise non-isomorphic finite groups having

called unrecognizable (by Gruenberg--Kegel graph).
  Recently P.J. Cameron and the first author have proved that if a finite group

which almost simple groups (in particular, finite simple groups) are almost

multicalibration with respect to H to imply Bayes optimality. We also show that
if H satisfies our weak learning condition relative to another class C then
multicalibration with respect to H implies multicalibration with respect to C.

numerous exploits on popular contracts resulting in financial damage of

sound static analysis tools, which assist smart contract developers in
eliminating contract vulnerabilities a priori to deployment. Vulnerability
assessment that is sound and insightful for EVM contracts is a formidable
challenge because contracts execute low-level bytecode in a largely unknown and

(LES) framework, we are concerned with finding closure models that represent
the effect of the unresolved subgrid scales on the resolved scales. Recent
approaches gravitate towards machine learning techniques to construct such
models. However, the stability of machine-learned closure models and their
abidance by physical structure (e.g. symmetries, conservation laws) are still
open problems. To tackle both issues, we take the `discretize first, filter
next' approach, in which we apply a spatial averaging filter to existing
energy-conserving (fine-grid) discretizations. The main novelty is that we
extend the system of equations describing the filtered solution with a set of
equations that describe the evolution of (a compressed version of) the energy
of the subgrid scales. Having an estimate of this energy, we can use the
concept of energy conservation and derive stability. The compressed variables
are determined via a data-driven technique in such a way that the energy of the
subgrid scales is matched. For the extended system, the closure model should be
energy-conserving, and a new skew-symmetric convolutional neural network
architecture is proposed that has this property. Stability is thus guaranteed,
independent of the actual weights and biases of the network. Importantly, our
framework allows energy exchange between resolved scales and compressed subgrid
scales and thus enables backscatter. To model dissipative systems (e.g. viscous
flows), the framework is extended with a diffusive component. The introduced
neural network architecture is constructed such that it also satisfies momentum
conservation. We apply the new methodology to both the viscous Burgers'
equation and the Korteweg-De Vries equation in 1D and show superior stability
properties when compared to a vanilla convolutional neural network.

the drivers. Rather than one prediction (step, model, or variables) made by
conventional LSTM models, three charging load (energy demand) predictions of
EVs were made depending on different multi-feature inputs. Data fusion was used
to combine and optimize the different charging load prediction results. The
performance of the final implemented model was evaluated by the mean absolute
prediction error of the forecast. The implemented model had a prediction error
of 3.29%. This prediction error was lower than initial prediction results by
the LSTM model. The numerical results indicate an improvement in the
performance of the EV load forecast, indicating that the proposed model could

cohesion among its points and every function is continuous with respect to

allows for types to carry multiple kinds of spatial structure. The theory is a
relatively painless extension of spatial type theory, and enables us to give a

associated to the multipole. This allows the identification of the dipolar and
quadrupolar distortions that generate self-propulsion and self-rotation
respectively and serves as a guide for the design of arbitrary flow responses.
Our results can be applied to both defect loops in three-dimensional active
nematics and to systems with colloidal inclusions. They reveal the
geometry-dependence of the self-dynamics of defect loops and provide insights
into how colloids might be designed to achieve propulsive or rotational
dynamics, and more generally for the extraction of work from active nematics.
Finally, we extend our analysis also to two dimensions and to systems with
chiral active stresses.

consider the case in which the seller is an interested party, as the action

businesses use acquired information may positively or negatively affect the
seller, due to the presence of externalities on the information market. The
utilities of both the seller and the buyer depend on a random state of nature,
which is revealed to the seller, but it is unknown to the buyer. Thus, the
seller's goal is to (partially) sell their information about the state of
nature to the buyer, so as to concurrently maximize revenue and induce the
buyer to take a desirable action. We study settings in which buyer's budget and
utilities are determined by a random buyer's type that is unknown to the

the buyer a menu of information-revelation policies to choose from, with the
latter acquiring one of them by paying its corresponding price. Moreover, since
in our model the seller is an interested party, an optimal protocol must also
prescribe the seller to pay back the buyer contingently on their action. First,
we show that the problem of computing a seller-optimal protocol can be solved
in polynomial time. Next, we switch the attention to the case in which a
seller's protocol employs a single information-revelation policy, rather than
proposing a menu, deriving both positive and negative results.

pick the IHR zones so that the power loss effects within the IHRs can be
neglected. This simplifies the overall matching problem into independent
IHR-level matching problems, and an upper-level optimal power flow problem to
meet the IHR-level upstream flow requirements while respecting the grid
constraints. Within each IHR, the agent employs a scalable Deep Reinforcement
Learning algorithm to identify matching solutions such that the customer's
service constraints are met. The central agent then solves an optimal power
flow problem with the IHRs as the nodes, with their active power flow and
reactive power limits, and grid constraints to determine the final flows such
that matched power can be delivered to the extent the grid constraints are
satisfied. The proposed framework is implemented on a test power distribution

recent work has focused on developing management schemes which decide how to

maximum parallelisation is sub-optimal in relation to user-critical metrics

leverages a graph neural network and reinforcement learning to learn how much

naturally represented as a ranking and an uncertain priority as a distribution

applicants to university seats or job applicants to job openings when the
admitting body is uncertain about the true priority over applicants. This
uncertainty can express the possibility of bias in the generation of the
priority ranking. We believe we are the first to explicitly formulate and study
the assignment problem with uncertain priorities. We introduce two natural
notions of fairness in this problem: stochastic envy-freeness (SEF) and
likelihood envy-freeness (LEF). We show that SEF and LEF are incompatible and
that LEF is incompatible with ordinal efficiency. We describe two algorithms,
Cycle Elimination (CE) and Unit-Time Eating (UTE) that satisfy ordinal
efficiency (a form of ex-ante Pareto optimality) and SEF; the well known random
serial dictatorship algorithm satisfies LEF and the weaker efficiency guarantee
of ex-post Pareto optimality. We also show that CE satisfies a relaxation of
LEF that we term 1-LEF which applies only to certain comparisons of priority,
while UTE satisfies a version of proportional allocations with ranks. We
conclude by demonstrating how a mediator can model a problem of school
admission in the face of bias as an assignment problem with uncertain priority.

Ideally, any scheme to suppress this leakage should not result in a loss in

a single emitter, a semiconductor quantum dot, is embedded in a microcavity.
The scheme exploits the splitting of the cavity mode into two
orthogonally-polarised modes: one mode is used for excitation, the other for
collection. By linking experiment to theory, we show that the best population

Rabi oscillations have an unusual dependence on pulse power. Our theory
describes them quantitatively allowing us to determine the absolute photon

to identify the hazard boundary of ML Components (MLCs) in the MLAS under

behavior and system context that can lead to hazards, it can then be used to,
for example, build a safety monitor that can take any predefined fallback
mechanisms at runtime when reaching the hazard boundary. However, determining
such hazard boundary for an ML component is challenging. This is due to the
space combining system contexts (i.e., scenarios) and MLC behaviors (i.e.,
inputs and outputs) being far too large for exhaustive exploration and even to
handle using conventional metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms.
Additionally, the high computational cost of simulations required to determine
any MLAS safety violations makes the problem even more challenging.
Furthermore, it is unrealistic to consider a region in the problem space

Cooperative Co-Evolutionary Algorithm (CCEA), which aims to tackle a
high-dimensional problem by decomposing it into two lower-dimensional search
subproblems. Moreover, we take a probabilistic view of safe and unsafe regions
and define a novel fitness function to measure the distance from the
probabilistic hazard boundary and thus drive the search effectively. We
evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of MLCSHE on a complex Autonomous

  Questions for Table-based Reasoning","SIGIR 2023",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Table-based reasoning has shown remarkable progress in combining deep models
with discrete reasoning, which requires reasoning over both free-form natural
language (NL) questions and structured tabular data. However, previous
table-based reasoning solutions usually suffer from significant performance
degradation on huge evidence (tables). In addition, most existing methods
struggle to reason over complex questions since the required information is
scattered in different places. To alleviate the above challenges, we exploit
large language models (LLMs) as decomposers for effective table-based
reasoning, which (i) decompose huge evidence (a huge table) into sub-evidence
(a small table) to mitigate the interference of useless information for table
reasoning; and (ii) decompose complex questions into simpler sub-questions for
text reasoning. Specifically, we first use the LLMs to break down the evidence
(tables) involved in the current question, retaining the relevant evidence and
excluding the remaining irrelevant evidence from the huge table. In addition,
we propose a ""parsing-execution-filling"" strategy to alleviate the
hallucination dilemma of the chain of thought by decoupling logic and numerical
computation in each step. Extensive experiments show that our method can
effectively leverage decomposed evidence and questions and outperforms the
strong baselines on TabFact, WikiTableQuestion, and FetaQA datasets. Notably,
our model outperforms human performance for the first time on the TabFact
dataset.

third-body eclipses where the third (`tertiary') star occults the inner
eclipsing binary (EB), or vice versa. We utilize a photodynamical analysis of
the TESS photometry, archival photometric data, TESS eclipse timing variations
of the EBs, available archival spectral energy distribution curves (SED), and,
in some cases, newly acquired radial velocity observations, to solve for the
parameters of all three stars, as well as most of the orbital elements. From
these analyses we find that the outer orbits of all nine systems are viewed
nearly edge on (i.e., within $\lesssim 4^\circ$), and 6 of the systems are
coplanar to within $5^\circ$; the others have mutual inclination angles of
$20^\circ$, $41^\circ$, and possibly $179^\circ$ (i.e., a retrograde outer
orbit). The outer orbital periods range from 47.8 days to 604 days, with
eccentricities spanning 0.004 to 0.61. The masses of all 18 EB stars are in the
range of 0.9-2.6 M$_\odot$ and are mostly situated near the main sequence. By
contrast, the masses and radii of the tertiary stars range from 1.4-2.8
M$_\odot$ and 1.5-13 R$_\odot$, respectively. We make use of the system
parameters from these 9 systems, plus those from a comparable number of compact
triply eclipsing triples published previously, to gain some statistical insight

hypothesis that instead of performing gradient-based updates on an entire image
at once, it should be possible to achieve a good solution by performing model
updates on only small parts of the image at a time, ensuring that the majority
of it is covered over the course of iterations. PatchGD thus extensively enjoys
better memory and compute efficiency when training models on large scale
images. PatchGD is thoroughly evaluated on two datasets - PANDA and UltraMNIST
with ResNet50 and MobileNetV2 models under different memory constraints. Our
evaluation clearly shows that PatchGD is much more stable and efficient than
the standard gradient-descent method in handling large images, and especially
when the compute memory is limited.

we study a new property of hash families that is strongly related to d-perfect
hashing, namely c-ideality. On the one hand, this notion generalizes the
definition of perfect hashing, which has been studied extensively; on the other
hand, it provides a direct link to the notion of c-approximativity. We focus on
the usually neglected case where the average load \alpha is at least 1 and
prove upper and lower parametrized bounds on the minimal size of c-ideal hash
families.
  As an aside, we show how c-ideality helps to analyze the advice complexity of
hashing. The concept of advice, introduced a decade ago, lets us measure the
information content of an online problem. We prove hashing's advice complexity
to be linear in the hash table size.

has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher

depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it
explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a

ascertained that the frequency of type II bursts depicts a bimodal distribution

collections of inputs. For some applications, the synopsis should accurately
\emph{synthesize} inputs with respect to a key property or aspect. For example,
a synopsis of film reviews all written about a particular movie should reflect
the average critic consensus. As a more consequential example, consider
narrative summaries that accompany biomedical \emph{systematic reviews} of
clinical trial results. These narratives should fairly summarize the
potentially conflicting results from individual trials.
  In this paper we ask: To what extent do modern multi-document summarization
models implicitly perform this type of synthesis? To assess this we perform a
suite of experiments that probe the degree to which conditional generation
models trained for summarization using standard methods yield outputs that
appropriately synthesize inputs. We find that existing models do partially
perform synthesis, but do so imperfectly. In particular, they are
over-sensitive to changes in input ordering and under-sensitive to changes in
input compositions (e.g., the ratio of positive to negative movie reviews). We
propose a simple, general method for improving model synthesis capabilities by
generating an explicitly diverse set of candidate outputs, and then selecting
from these the string best aligned with the expected aggregate measure for the
inputs, or \emph{abstaining} when the model produces no good candidate. This
approach improves model synthesis performance. We hope highlighting the need
for synthesis (in some summarization settings), motivates further research into
multi-document summarization methods and learning objectives that explicitly
account for the need to synthesize.

to dark energy domination (which acts as a ""reflection"" in connection space).
We are able to exclude some regions of parameter space and show with projected
constraints that future experiments like DESI will be able to further constrain
these models. An interesting feature of this theory is that there exists a
region of parameter space that could naturally alleviate the $S_8$ tension.

that first-order quantum phase transitions (QPTs) due to localisation phenomena
cause AQC to fail by exponentially decreasing the minimal spectral gap of the

often linked to the localisation of the ground state in a local minimum,
requiring the system to tunnel into the global minimum at a later stage of the
annealing. Recent methods have been proposed to avoid this phenomena by
carefully designing the involved Hamiltonians. However, it remains a challenge
to formulate a comprehensive theory on the effect of the various parameters and
the conditions under which QPTs make the AQC algorithm fail. Equipped with
concepts from graph theory, in this work we link graph quantities associated to
the Hamiltonians along the anneal path with the occurrence of QPTs. These links
allow us to derive bounds on the location of the minimal spectral gap along the

of oscillations being inversely proportional to the spatial scale of a

with the divergence of velocity, which allows stable, but nonvanishing
solutions to propagate along characteristics. Further, we find that such
nonvanishing velocity divergence produces the Kolmogorov energy scaling, due to
a cubic relation between the physical time, and the asymptotically autonomous
pseudo-time variable on characteristics. These effects vanish when the mean

black widow `spider' pulsars are a sub-category of binary MSPs that `devour'
their companions through ablation - the process through which material is
lifted from the stellar surface by a pulsar wind. In addition to reducing the
companion star's mass, ablation introduces observable characteristics like
extended, energy-dependent and asymmetric eclipse profiles in systems observed
at a sufficiently high inclination. Here, we present a detailed study and
comparison of the X-ray eclipses of two NS LMXBs; $\textit{Swift}$
J1858.6$-$0814 and EXO 0748$-$676. Some of the X-ray eclipse characteristics
observed in these two LMXBs are similar to the radio eclipse characteristics of
eclipsing redback and black widow pulsars, suggesting that they may also host
ablated companion stars. X-ray irradiation or a pulsar wind could drive the
ablation. We conduct orbital phase-resolved spectroscopy for both LMXBs to map
the column density, ionization and covering fraction of the material outflow.
From this, we infer the presence of highly ionized and clumpy ablated material
around the companion star in both systems. We term LMXBs undergoing ablation,
$\textit{false widows}$, and speculate that they may be the progenitors of
redback pulsars under the assumption that ablation begins in the LMXB stage.
Therefore, the false widows could provide a link between LMXBs and spider
pulsars. The detection of radio pulsations during non-accreting states can
support this hypothesis.

galaxies and are most preferentially found in star-forming galaxies with lower

powered by super-Eddington accretion of matter onto stellar-mass compact
objects (black holes and neutron stars). This is driven by the discovery of
coherent pulsations, cyclotron lines and powerful winds in members of the ULX

spectrometers such as those aboard XMM-Newton. ULX winds carry a huge amount of
power owing to their relativistic speeds (0.1-0.3 c) and are likely responsible

the absence of global symmetries, thus providing an interesting prediction of

involved bordism groups as well as their generators, which correspond to
asymptotic boundaries of explicit string theory backgrounds. The main tool is
the Adams spectral sequence, to which we provide a detailed introduction. We

the $3\to 2$ process setting the relic abundance in this case requires one

the Co-SIMP interaction with a dark sector consisting of two scalars, with the
mediator coupling to either nucleons or electrons. In either case, \textit{the
dark matter candidate is naturally light}: nucleophilic interactions favor the
sub-GeV mass range and leptophilic interactions favor the sub-MeV mass range.
Viable thermal models in these lighter mass regimes are particularly intriguing
to study at this time, as new developments in low-threshold detector
technologies will begin probing this region of parameter space. While particles
in the sub-MeV regime can potentially impact light element formation and CMB
decoupling, we show that a late-time phase transition opens up large fractions
of parameter space. These thermal light dark matter models can instead be
tested with dedicated experiments. We discuss the viable parameter space in

emerged as potential explanations for this valley: photoevaporation and
core-powered mass-loss. However, Rogers et al. (2021) shows that
differentiating between the two theories is possible using the
three-dimensional parameter space of planet radius, incident flux, and stellar
mass. We use homogeneously-derived stellar and planetary parameters to measure
the $Kepler$ exoplanet radius gap in this three-dimensional space. We compute
the slope of the gap as a function of incident flux at constant stellar mass
($\alpha$ $\equiv$ $\left(\partial \log R_{\mathrm{gap}} / \partial \log S

constant incident flux ($\beta$ $\equiv$ $\left(\partial \log R_{\mathrm{gap}}

that Rogers et al. (2021) shows that core-powered mass-loss predicts $\alpha$
$\approx$ 0.08 and $\beta$ $\approx$ 0.00 while photoevaporation predicts
$\alpha$ $\approx$ 0.12 and $\beta$ $\approx$ --0.17, our measurements are more
consistent with core-powered mass-loss than photoevaporation. However, we
caution that different gap-determination methods can produce systematic offsets
in both $\alpha$ and $\beta$; therefore, we motivate a comprehensive
re-analysis of $Kepler$ light curves with modern, updated priors on
eccentricity and mean stellar density to improve both the accuracy and
precision of planet radii and subsequent measurements of the gap.

invented long ago with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity
$\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components.

identified using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy from the CEERS Survey. We detect
broad H$\alpha$ emission from both sources, with FWHM of $2038\pm286$ and
$1807\pm207$ km s$^{-1}$, resulting in black hole (BH) masses that are 1-2 dex
below that of existing samples of luminous quasars at $z>5$. The first source,
CEERS 1670 at $z=5.242$, is 2-3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar
redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based
on its rest-frame optical SED. We measure a BH mass of $M_{\rm
BH}=1.3\pm0.4\times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$, confirming that this AGN is powered by
the least-massive BH known in the universe at the end of cosmic reionization.
The second source, CEERS 3210 at $z=5.624$, is inferred to be a heavily
obscured, broad-line AGN caught in a transition phase between a dust-obscured
starburst and an unobscured quasar. We estimate its BH mass to be $M_{\rm
BH}\simeq 0.9-4.7 \times 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$, depending on the level of dust
obscuration assumed. We derive host stellar masses, $M_\star$, allowing us to
place constraints on the BH-galaxy mass relationship in the lowest mass range
yet probed in the early universe. The $M_{\rm BH}/M_\star$ ratio for CEERS
1670, in particular, is consistent with or higher than the empirical
relationship seen in massive galaxies at $z=0$. We examine the emission-line
ratios of both sources and find that their location on the BPT and OHNO
diagrams is consistent with model predictions for low-metallicity AGN with
$Z/Z_\odot \simeq 0.2-0.4$. The spectroscopic identification of low-luminosity,
broad-line AGN at $z>5$ with $M_{\rm BH}\simeq 10^{7}~M_{\odot}$ demonstrates

determinations of $V_{cb}$ and $V_{ub}$. Furthermore, this method avoids the
impact of NP on the determination of these parameters present likely in global

$Z^\prime$ models we point out, following the 2009 observations of Monika

$\varepsilon'/\varepsilon$ and $\Delta M_K$ can be present. In the simplest

is a strict correlation between $K^+\to\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ and

We also investigate the case in which the cores form a binary and emit
gravitational waves. In the case of RGs this is particularly interesting
because the cores are degenerate. We find that MS event rate can be as high as
tens per year, and that of RGs one order of magnitude larger. The collisions
are powerful enough to mimic supernovae- or tidal disruptions events. We find
Zwicky Transient Facility observational data which seem to exhibit the features

force which has an impact on the chirping mass of the gravitational wave. As a
consequence, the two small cores in principle mimic two supermassive black
holes merging. However, their evolution in frequency along with the precedent
electromagnetic burst and the ulterior afterglow are efficient tools to reveal
the impostors. In the particular case of RGs, we derive the properties of the
degenerate He cores and their H-burning shells to analyse the formation of the

In this work, we investigate the fate of the PLRBM to non-Hermiticity. We
consider the case where the random on-site diagonal potential takes complex

an analytical understanding of the model by generalizing the Anderson-Levitov

identifies two competing mechanisms due to non-Hermiticity: one favoring
localization and the other delocalization. The competition between the two
gives rise to AT at $d/2\le \alpha\le d$. The value of the critical $\alpha$
depends on the strength of the on-site potential, reminiscent of Hermitian
disordered short-range models in $d>2$. Within the localized phase, the wave

this Emergence Proposal for fundamental scales in the Standard Model (SM). In
this scheme all Yukawa couplings are of order one in the UV and small Yukawas
for lighter generations appear via large anomalous dimensions induced by the
towers of states. Thus, the observed hierarchies of quark and lepton masses are
a reflection of the structure of towers of states that lie below the Quantum
Gravity scale, $\Lambda_{\text{QG}}$. Small Dirac neutrino masses consistent
with experimental observation appear due to the existence of a tower of SM
singlet states of mass $m_{0}\simeq Y_{\nu_3}M_p\simeq 7\times 10^5$ GeV,
opening up a new extra dimension, while the UV cut-off occurs at
$\Lambda_{\text{QG}}\lesssim 10^{14}$ GeV. Additional constraints relating the
Electro-Weak (EW) and cosmological constant (c.c.) scales (denoted
$M_{\text{EW}}$ and $V_0$) appear if the Swampland condition $m_{\nu_1}\lesssim

itself arises upon applying the AdS non-SUSY Conjecture or the AdS/dS Distance
Conjecture to the 3d vacua from circle compactifications of the SM. In
particular, the EW scale and that of the extra dimension fulfill ${m_0 \,

problem to that of the c.c. Hence, all fundamental scales may be written as

planetesimals which are likely to exist around white dwarfs. Here we simulate
the dynamical evolution of equal-mass binary asteroid systems around white

planets are efficient at dissociating and ejecting binary asteroid systems on
eccentric orbits, while Earth-mass planets are better at keeping planetesimals
in their planetary systems. We find binary systems can be dissociated and
ejected from their systems across Myr timescales, producing interstellar
objects. We do not expect a population of free-floating binary asteroid systems
as all ejected planetesimals are gravitationally unbound from each other.
Further, we discuss the influence of asteroid binarity on the white dwarf

experimental findings are supported by electromagnetic simulations that enable
us to explore systematically, and in detail, the emergence of plexciton

qualitatively different interference patterns depending on the spatial
distribution of the supercurrent through the junction. In JJs based on
two-dimensional topological insulators (2DTIs), the electrons/holes forming a
Cooper pair (CP) can either propagate along the same edge or be split into the
two edges. The former leads to a SQUID-like interference pattern, with the
superconducting flux quantum $\phi_0$ (where $\phi_0=h/2e$) as a fundamental
period. If CPs' splitting is additionally included, the resultant periodicity
doubles. Since the edge states are typically considered to be strongly
localized, the critical current does not decay as a function of the magnetic
field. The present paper goes beyond this approach and inspects a topological
JJ in the tunneling regime featuring extended edge states. It is here
considered the possibility that the two electrons of a CP propagate and explore
the junction independently over length scales comparable to the superconducting
coherence length. As a consequence of the spatial extension, a decaying pattern
with different possible periods is obtained. In particular, it is shown that,
if crossed Andreev reflections (CARs) are dominant and the edge states overlap,
the resulting interference pattern features oscillations whose periodicity
approaches $2\phi_0$.

in a variety of selection processes. In this context, it has been recently
shown that, if a classifier is calibrated, one can identify the smallest set of
candidates which contains, in expectation, a desired number of qualified
candidates using a threshold decision rule. This lends support to focusing on
calibration as the only requirement for screening classifiers. In this paper,
we argue that screening policies that use calibrated classifiers may suffer
from an understudied type of within-group discrimination -- they may
discriminate against qualified members within demographic groups of interest.
Further, we argue that this type of discrimination can be avoided if
classifiers satisfy within-group monotonicity, a natural monotonicity property
within each of the groups. Then, we introduce an efficient post-processing
algorithm based on dynamic programming to minimally modify a given calibrated
classifier so that its probability estimates satisfy within-group monotonicity.
We validate our algorithm using US Census survey data and show that
within-group monotonicity can be often achieved at a small cost in terms of
prediction granularity and shortlist size.

higher-resolution galaxy simulations. One possible solution is to use an
(approximate) Hamiltonian splitting method, in which only regions requiring
small timesteps are integrated with small timesteps, separated from the entire
galaxy. In particular, gas affected by supernova (SN) explosions often requires
the smallest timestep in such a simulation. To apply the Hamiltonian splitting
method to the particles affected by SNe in a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics
simulation, we need to identify the regions where such SN-affected particles
reside during the subsequent global step (the integration timestep for the
entire galaxy) in advance. In this paper, we developed a deep learning model to
predict a shell expansion after a SN explosion and an image processing
algorithm to identify SN-affected particles in the predicted regions. We found
that we can identify more than 95 per cent of the target particles with our
method, which is a better identification rate than using an analytic approach
with the Sedov-Taylor solution. Combined with the Hamiltonian splitting method,
our particle selection method using deep learning will improve the performance
of galaxy simulations with extremely high resolution.

literature suggests that some of these frequencies are important to reproduce
key qualities of eye-movements (``signal'') and some of these frequencies are
not important (``noise''). To understand what is signal and what is noise, we
analyzed our dataset in three ways: (1) visual inspection of plots of saccade,
microsaccade and smooth pursuit exemplars; (2) an analysis of the percentage of
variance accounted for (PVAF) in each of 1,033 unfiltered saccade trajectories
by each frequency cutoff; (3) an analysis of saccade peak velocity in the
unfiltered and various filtered conditions. Visual inspection suggested that
frequencies up to 75 Hz are required to represent microsaccades. Our PVAF
analysis indicated that data in the 0-25 Hz band are sufficient to account for
nearly 100% of the variance in unfiltered saccade trajectories. Our analysis
also indicated that frequencies below 100 Hz are sufficient to maintain peak
velocities. Therefore, our overall conclusion is that to maintain eye-movement
signal and reduce noise, a cutoff frequency of 100 Hz is appropriate. Our
results have implications for the proposed sampling rate of eye-tracking
recordings. If one is working in the frequency domain and 100 Hz needs to be
preserved, the minimum required sampling rate would be 200 Hz. However, in a
time domain analysis, a minimum 1000 Hz sampling rate is recommended.

Kazhdan-Lusztig theory (due to Vogan and Soergel) describe representations of a
group and its pure inner forms with fixed central character in terms of
constructible sheaves. Conjectures in the spirit of geometric Langlands (due to
Fargues, Zhu and Hellmann) describe representations with varying central
character of a large family of groups associated to isocrystals in terms of
coherent sheaves. The latter conjectures also take place on a larger parameter
space, in which Frobenius (or complex conjugation) is allowed a unipotent part.
  In this article we propose a general mechanism that interpolates between

innovation that benefits society as a whole. A common indicator of diversity
consideration is the representation of different social groups among software
engineering (SE) researchers, developers, and students. However, this does not
necessarily entail that diversity is considered in the SE research itself.
  In our study, we examine how diversity is embedded in SE research,
particularly research that involves participant studies. To this end, we have
selected 79 research papers containing 105 participant studies spanning three
years of ICSE technical tracks. Using a content analytical approach, we
identified how SE researchers report the various diversity categories of their
study participants and investigated: 1) the extent to which participants are
described, 2) what diversity categories are commonly reported, and 3) the
function diversity serves in the SE studies.
  We identified 12 different diversity categories reported in SE participant
studies. Our results demonstrate that even though most SE studies report on the
diversity of participants, SE research often emphasizes professional diversity
data, such as occupation and work experience, over social diversity data, such
as gender or location of the participants. Furthermore, our results show that
participant diversity is seldom analyzed or reflected upon when SE researchers
discuss their study results, outcome or limitations. To help researchers
self-assess their study diversity awareness, we propose a diversity awareness
model and guidelines that SE researchers can apply to their research. With this
study, we hope to shed light on a new approach to tackling the diversity and
inclusion crisis in the SE field.

with temperature down to temperatures much lower than the Bloch-Gr\""uneisen
scale defined by electron kinematics on the Fermi surface. This result stems
from the friction between layers, which transfers phason spectral weight to a
broad diffusive low-energy peak in the mechanical response of the system. As a
result, phason scattering becomes a very efficient channel for entropy
production at low temperatures. We discuss the implications of this finding to
reports of linear-in-$T$ resistivity in the phase diagram of twisted bilayer

  - collapsed oscillations: oscillatory growth of the scalar hair, nonlinearly
induced by the collapse.
  - fluctuating collapse: the final Kasner exponents' dependency in $\epsilon$

Lagrangian markers (to represent the particle surface) to fulfill the no-slip
condition at the surfaces of the particles, allowing both symmetrical and
non-symmetrical interpolation and spreading supports to be used. This enables
that local source term contributions to the Eulerian grid, accounting for the
boundary condition enforced at a Lagrangian marker on the surface of a
particle, can be present on the inside of the particle only when this is
beneficial, for instance when the Lagrangian marker is near another particle
surface or near a domain boundary. However, when the Lagrangian marker is not
near another particle surface or a domain boundary, the interpolation and
spreading operators are locally symmetrical, meaning a ``classic'' IBM scheme
is adopted. This approach, named hybrid IBM (HyBM), is validated with a number
of test-cases from the literature. These results show that the HyBM achieves
more accurate results compared to a classical IBM framework, especially at
coarser mesh resolutions, when there are Lagrangian markers close to a particle

measure the absolute Ca II HK and H$\alpha$ flux of a sample of 110 HARPS M
dwarfs and also extend the calibration of $R'_\mathrm{HK}$ to the M dwarf
regime using PHOENIX stellar atmosphere models. Methods: We normalized a
template spectrum with a high signal-to-noise ratio that was obtained by
coadding multiple spectra of the same star to a PHOENIX stellar atmosphere
model to measure the chromospheric Ca II HK and H$\alpha$ flux in physical
units. We used three different $T_\mathrm{eff}$ calibrations and investigated
their effect on Ca II HK and H$\alpha$ activity measurements. We performed
conversions of the Mount Wilson S index to $R'_\mathrm{HK}$ as a function of
effective temperature for the range 2300 K $\le T_\mathrm{eff} \le$ 7200 K.
Last, we calculated continuum luminosity $\chi$ values for Ca II HK and
H$\alpha$ in the same manner as West & Hawley (2008) for $-1.0 \le
\mathrm{Fe/H} \le +1.0$ in steps of $\Delta \mathrm{Fe/H} = 0.5$. Results: We
compare different $T_\mathrm{eff}$ calibrations and find $\Delta T_\mathrm{eff}
\sim$ several 100 K for mid- to late-M dwarfs. Using these different
$T_\mathrm{eff}$ calibrations, we establish a catalog of $\log R'_\mathrm{HK}$

agents in their environment. The creation of models to describe these
relationships is typically accomplished through the application of causal
discovery techniques. However, as it stands observational causal discovery
techniques struggle to adequately cope with conditions such as causal sparsity
and non-stationarity typically seen during online usage in autonomous agent
domains. Meanwhile, interventional techniques are not always feasible due to
domain restrictions. In order to better explore the issues facing observational
techniques and promote further discussion of these topics we carry out a
benchmark across 10 contemporary observational temporal causal discovery
methods in the domain of autonomous driving. By evaluating these methods upon
causal scenes drawn from real world datasets in addition to those generated
synthetically we highlight where improvements need to be made in order to
facilitate the application of causal discovery techniques to the aforementioned
use-cases. Finally, we discuss potential directions for future work that could
help better tackle the difficulties currently experienced by state of the art

the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, and the so-called $S_8$ parameter has been a
challenge in precision cosmology. Several models are present to address these
tensions, but very few of them can do so simultaneously. In the past, we have
suggested Banks-Zaks/Unparticles as an emergent Dark Energy model and claimed
that it can ameliorate the Hubble tension. In this work, we test this claim and
perform a likelihood analysis of the model and its parameters are given current
data and compare it to $\Lambda$CDM. The model offers a possible resolution of
Hubble tension and softens the Large Scale Structure (LSS) tension without
employing a scalar field or modifying the gravitational sector. Our analysis
shows a higher value of $H_0 \sim 70 - 73$ km/sec/Mpc and a slightly lower
value of $S_8$ for various combinations of data sets. Consideration of Planck
CMB data combined with the Pantheon sample and SH0ES priors lowers the $H_0$
and $S_8$ tension to $0.96 \sigma$ and $0.94 \sigma$ respectively with best-fit
$\Delta \chi^2 \approx -10$ restoring cosmological concordance. Significant
improvement in the likelihood persists for other combinations of data sets as
well. Evidence for the model is given by inferring one of its parameters to be
$x_0\simeq-4.36$.

using a dense network of three-component (3C) nodal stations acquired in 2019
at the Garner Valley Downhole Array (GVDA) site. Acquisition of this dataset
involved the deployment of 196, 3C nodal stations positioned on a 14 by 14 grid
with a 5-m spacing. The array was used to acquire active-source data generated
by a vibroseis truck and an instrumented sledgehammer, and passive-wavefield
data containing ambient noise. The active-source acquisition included 66
vibroseis and 209 instrumented sledgehammer source locations. Multiple source
impacts were recorded at each source location to enable stacking of the
recorded signals. The active-source recordings are provided in terms of both
raw, uncorrected units of counts and corrected engineering units of meters per

instrumented sledgehammer was recorded and is provided in both raw counts and
engineering units of kilonewtons. The passive-wavefield data includes 28 hours
of ambient noise recorded over two night-time deployments. The dataset is shown

source, this life-saving device sends electrical shocks or pulses to regulate
the heartbeat. The service life and reliability of an ICD is primarily
expressed by its battery's lifespan and performance. In this paper we
investigate the terminal voltage, depth of discharge (DOD) and temperature
dynamics of the implantable lithium battery with a combined cathode material,
namely carbon-monofluoride and silver vanadium oxide (Li/CFx-SVO). Modeling the
implantable batteries characteristics is a well-established topic in
literature; however, to the best of the author's knowledge, the impact of the
high-energy shocks (defibrillation) and low-energy device power supply
(housekeeping) on the ICD's battery operation is relatively less-explored. Our
analysis reveals that the battery terminal voltage is primarily affected by
small but continuous housekeeping discharge current in the range of uA, rather
than intermittent high defibrillation current demand in the range of several
amps. The results can be used to improve the device design control and
operation, thus extending the service life in patients and reducing the need

Various lines of empirical evidence have supported the social brain hypothesis,

itself positively impact cooperation among individuals, which occurs across
different animal taxa and is a key behavior for successful group living.
Theoretical research has shown that particular structures of social networks
foster cooperation more easily than others. Therefore, we hypothesized that
species with a relatively large neocortex tend to form social networks that
better enable cooperation. In the present study, we combine data on brain and
body mass, data on social networks, and theory on the evolution of cooperation
on networks to test this hypothesis in primates. We have found a positive

generative modeling (GANs), transfer learning, and fairness. However,
successfully training adversarial nets using first-order methods remains a
major challenge. Typically, careful choices of the learning rates are needed to
maintain the delicate balance between the competing networks. In this paper, we
design a novel learning rate scheduler that dynamically adapts the learning
rate of the adversary to maintain the right balance. The scheduler is driven by
the fact that the loss of an ideal adversarial net is a constant known a
priori. The scheduler is thus designed to keep the loss of the optimized
adversarial net close to that of an ideal network. We run large-scale
experiments to study the effectiveness of the scheduler on two popular
applications: GANs for image generation and adversarial nets for domain
adaptation. Our experiments indicate that adversarial nets trained with the
scheduler are less likely to diverge and require significantly less tuning. For
example, on CelebA, a GAN with the scheduler requires only one-tenth of the
tuning budget needed without a scheduler. Moreover, the scheduler leads to
statistically significant improvements in model quality, reaching up to $27\%$
in Frechet Inception Distance for image generation and $3\%$ in test accuracy
for domain adaptation.

the exponent in the equation, $-\Delta_p u$, can have a singular part in
accordance with the Lebesgue Decomposition Theorem. The singular portion of
$-\Delta_p u$ corresponds to where $-\Delta_p u = -\infty$, which leads it to
have a canceling effect with the exponential nonlinearity. This effect has
already been demonstrated for the case of a linear exponent $p=2$, and for the
time independent problem. Our investigation reveals that we can exploit this

candidates for PQC, and identify that SABER is not only a front-runner when
executing on traditional systems, but it is also amenable to acceleration with
crossbars. SABER is a module-LWR based approach, which performs modular
polynomial multiplications with rounding. We map the polynomial multiplications
in SABER on crossbars and show that analog dot-products can yield a
$1.7-32.5\times$ performance and energy efficiency improvement, compared to
recent hardware proposals. This initial design combines the innovations in
multiple state-of-the-art works -- the algorithm in SABER and the memristive
acceleration principles proposed in ISAAC (for deep neural network
acceleration). We then identify the bottlenecks in this initial design and
introduce several additional techniques to improve its efficiency. These
techniques are synergistic and especially benefit from SABER's power-of-two
modulo operation. First, we show that some of the software techniques used in
SABER, that are effective on CPU platforms, are unhelpful in crossbar-based
accelerators. Relying on simpler algorithms further improves our efficiencies
by $1.3-3.6\times$. Second, we exploit the nature of SABER's computations to
stagger the operations in crossbars and share a few variable precision ADCs,
resulting in up to $1.8\times$ higher efficiency. Third, to further reduce ADC
pressure, we propose a simple analog Shift-and-Add technique, which results in
a $1.3-6.3\times$ increase in the efficiency. Overall, our designs achieve

  Data Labeling","Accepted by INFOCOM 2023 (10 pages, 7 figures)",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm that trains
machine learning (ML) models on clients' devices in a distributed manner
without the need of transmitting clients' data to the FL server. In many
applications of ML, the labels of training data need to be generated manually
by human agents. In this paper, we study FL with crowdsourced data labeling
where the local data of each participating client of FL are labeled manually by
the client. We consider the strategic behavior of clients who may not make
desired effort in their local data labeling and local model computation and may
misreport their local models to the FL server. We characterize the performance
bounds on the training loss as a function of clients' data labeling effort,
local computation effort, and reported local models. We devise truthful
incentive mechanisms which incentivize strategic clients to make truthful
efforts and report true local models to the server. The truthful design
exploits the non-trivial dependence of the training loss on clients' efforts
and local models. Under the truthful mechanisms, we characterize the server's
optimal local computation effort assignments. We evaluate the proposed FL
algorithms with crowdsourced data labeling and the incentive mechanisms using
experiments.

raising new concerns about the security of data storage and communication.
Federated learning, which does not require centralizing data, is a common
approach to preventing heavy data transportation, securing valued data, and
protecting personal information protection. Therefore, determining how to
aggregate the information obtained from the analysis of data in separate local
sites has become an important statistical issue. The commonly used averaging
methods may not be suitable due to data nonhomogeneity and incomparable results
among individual sites, and applying them may result in the loss of information
obtained from the individual analyses. Using a sequential method in federated
learning with distributed computing can facilitate the integration and
accelerate the analysis process. We develop a data-driven method for
efficiently and effectively aggregating valued information by analyzing local
data without encountering potential issues such as information security and
heavy transportation due to data communication. In addition, the proposed
method can preserve the properties of classical sequential adaptive design,
such as data-driven sample size and estimation precision when applied to
generalized linear models. We use numerical studies of simulated data and an
application to COVID-19 data collected from 32 hospitals in Mexico, to
illustrate the proposed method.

graph-structure data, while their high reliance on graph structure for

Graph-regularized MLPs (GR-MLPs) implicitly inject the graph structure
information into model weights, while their performance can hardly match that
of GNNs in most tasks. This motivates us to study the causes of the limited
performance of GR-MLPs. In this paper, we first demonstrate that node
embeddings learned from conventional GR-MLPs suffer from dimensional collapse,
a phenomenon in which the largest a few eigenvalues dominate the embedding
space, through empirical observations and theoretical analysis. As a result,
the expressive power of the learned node representations is constrained. We
further propose OrthoReg, a novel GR-MLP model to mitigate the dimensional
collapse issue. Through a soft regularization loss on the correlation matrix of
node embeddings, OrthoReg explicitly encourages orthogonal node representations
and thus can naturally avoid dimensionally collapsed representations.
Experiments on traditional transductive semi-supervised classification tasks
and inductive node classification for cold-start scenarios demonstrate its
effectiveness and superiority.

AbstractCube, a data type defined as a function from RegionFeatures space to

operators and their compositions to operate on to analyze the data. This
function-as-data modeling allows us to simultaneously capture a space of
non-uniform tables on the co-domain of the function, and region space structure
on the domain of the function. We describe two HoCA operators, cube crawling
and cube join, which are cube-to-cube transformations (i.e., higher-order
functions). Cube crawling explores a region subspace, and outputs a cube
mapping regions to signal vectors. Cube join, in turn, allows users to meld
information in different cubes, which is critical for composition. The cube
crawling interface introduces two novel features: (1) Region Analysis Models
(RAMs), which allows one to program and organize analysis on a set of data
features into a module. (2) Multi-Model Crawling, which allows one to apply
multiple models, potentially on different feature sets, during crawling. These
two features, together with cube join and a rich RAM library, allows us to
construct succinct HoCA programs to capture a wide variety of data-insight
problems in system monitoring, experimentation analysis, and business
intelligence. HoCA poses a rich algorithmic design space, such as optimizing
crawling performance leveraging region space structure, optimizing cube join
performance, and physical designs of cubes. We describe several cube crawling

This database can be used to correlate S spectral features with distinct S
species based on their local coordination and short-range ordering in

further analysis, such as spectral fingerprinting, matching with experiments,

reveal traces of the processes that led to their emergence. I report a new
universal regularity in syntactic structures: Their topology is communicatively
efficient above chance. The pattern holds, without exception, for all 124
languages studied, across linguistic families and modalities (spoken, written,

efficiency or, alternatively, by construction, as a by-effect of a sublinear
preferential attachment process reflecting language production mechanisms known
from psycholinguistics. This dual explanation shows how communicative
efficiency, per se, does not require optimization. Among the two options,
efficiency without optimization offers the better explanation for the new

absorption spectroscopy. By studying gas in galaxies in this way, it is
possible to investigate the small and faint galaxies, which are the most
numerous in the universe. In particular, the chemical distribution of gas in
absorbing systems gives us insight into cycles of gas in and around galaxies.
Here we study chemical enrichment within 64 Damped Lyman-alpha Absorption (DLA)
systems between $1.7 < z < 4.2$. We use high-resolution spectra from VLT/UVES
to infer dust depletion from relative abundances of several metals. We perform
a component-by-component analysis within DLAs, and characterise variations in
their chemical enrichment. Unlike hydrogen, the metal columns can be
characterised for individual components. We use them to derive the dust
depletion ([Zn/Fe]fit), as an indicator for chemical enrichment. We find that
some DLAs are chemically diverse within themselves, with [Zn/Fe]fit ranging up
to 0.62 dex within a single system. This suggests that absorbing gas within
these galaxies is chemically diverse. Although we do not find a clear trend of
decreasing dust depletion with redshift, we do see that the most chemically
enriched systems are at lower redshifts. We also observe evidence for dust-poor
components at all redshifts, which may be due to the accretion of pristine gas
onto galaxies. We combine the chemical and kinematic properties of the
individual gas components and observe potential signatures of infalling gas,
with low depletion at velocities below $\sim$100km/s, and outflows, with high
depletion and velocities of $\sim$600km/s. We find over-abundances of
alpha-elements (an enhancement of $\sim$0.3dex) and under-abundances of Mn in
several components, which is likely a signature of core-collapse SNe
nucleosythesis in the ISM. We observe these effects mostly at lower levels of
chemical enrichment.

total initial cell density mass is below $2\pi$ there exist globally defined
generalised solutions, but what is less understood is whether there are blow-up
solutions beyond such a threshold and its optimality.
  Motivated by this issue, a numerical blow-up scenario is investigated.
Approximate solutions computed via a stabilised finite element method founded
on a shock capturing technique are such that they satisfy \emph{a priori}
bounds as well as lower and $L^1(\Omega)$ bounds for the cell and
chemoattractant densities. In particular, this latter properties are essential
in detecting numerical blow-up configurations, since the non-satisfaction of
these two requirements might trigger numerical oscillations leading to
non-realistic finite-time collapses into persistent Dirac-type measures.
  Our findings show that the existence threshold value $2\pi$ encountered for
the cell density mass may not be optimal and hence it is conjectured that the
critical threshold value $4\pi$ may be inherited from the fluid-free
Keller-Segel equations. Additionally it is observed that the formation of

two-fluid jets using the JOANNA code, considering the magnetohydrodynamics of
two fluids (ions + electrons and neutral particles). We first excite the jets
in a uniform magnetic field by using velocity pulse perturbations located at
$y_{0}=$1.3, 1.5, and 1.8 Mm, considering the base of the photosphere at $y=0$
Mm. Then, we repeat the excitation of the jets in a magnetic field that mimics
a flux tube. Mainly, the jets excited at the upper chromosphere ($y\sim1.8$ Mm)
reach lower heights than those excited at the lower chromosphere ($y\sim1.3$
Mm); this is due to the higher initial vertical location because of the lesser
amount of plasma dragging. In both scenarios, the dynamics of the neutral
particles and ions show similar behavior; however, we can still identify some
differences in the velocity drift, which in our simulations is of the order of
$10^{-3}$ km s$^{-1}$ at the tips of the jets once they reached their maximum
heights. Also, we estimate the heat generation due to the friction between ions
and neutrals ($Q^{in}_{i,n}$), which is of the order of $0.002-0.06$ W
m$^{-3}$; however it is small to contribute to the heating of the surroundings
of the solar corona. The jets in the two magnetic environments do not show
substantial differences other than a slight variation in the maximum heights
reached, particularly in the uniform magnetic field scenario. Finally, the
maximum heights reached by the three different jets are in the range of some
morphological parameters corresponding to macrospicules, Type I spicules, and
Type II spicules.

deep neural network by solving a single nonconvex optimization problem. When
the layer number of the neural network is large, it is computationally
challenging to carry out such a task efficiently. Inspired by the human
education process which arranges learning in grades, we propose a multi-grade
learning model: We successively solve a number of optimization problems of
small sizes, which are organized in grades, to learn a shallow neural network
for each grade. Specifically, the current grade is to learn the leftover from
the previous grade. In each of the grades, we learn a shallow neural network
stacked on the top of the neural network, learned in the previous grades, which
remains unchanged in training of the current and future grades. By dividing the
task of learning a deep neural network into learning several shallow neural
networks, one can alleviate the severity of the nonconvexity of the original
optimization problem of a large size. When all grades of the learning are
completed, the final neural network learned is a stair-shape neural network,
which is the superposition of networks learned from all grades. Such a model
enables us to learn a deep neural network much more effectively and
efficiently. Moreover, multi-grade learning naturally leads to adaptive
learning. We prove that in the context of function approximation if the neural
network generated by a new grade is nontrivial, the optimal error of the grade
is strictly reduced from the optimal error of the previous grade. Furthermore,
we provide several proof-of-concept numerical examples which demonstrate that
the proposed multi-grade model outperforms significantly the traditional
single-grade model and is much more robust than the traditional model.

Dantzig-Wolfe, the PRD's self-benefiting algorithms are modeled as sub-problems
of the DW, and the coordinator (or the grid operator) who collects energy
consumption of PRDs (their energy bid), solves the master problem of the DW and
calculate the price signal accordingly. The proposed algorithm is fast since
the subproblem in DW (which could be millions of PRDs) can be solved
simultaneously. Furthermore, based on the DW theory, if the PRDs subproblems
are convex, reaching the optimal point (Equal to Nash Equilibrium) in limited
iterations is guaranteed. A simulation with 8 participant households has been

safety and efficiency of robotic systems in interactive settings, such as
human-robot interaction and multi-robot teaming tasks. Unfortunately, robots
often lack access to key information on which these predictions may hinge, such
as opponent's goals, attention, and willingness to cooperate. Dual control
theory addresses this challenge by treating unknown parameters of a predictive
model as hidden states and inferring their values at runtime using information
gathered during system operation. While able to optimally and automatically
trade off exploration and exploitation, dual control is computationally
intractable for general interactive motion planning. In this paper, we present
a novel algorithmic approach to enable active uncertainty reduction for
interactive motion planning based on the implicit dual control paradigm. Our
approach relies on sampling-based approximation of stochastic dynamic
programming, leading to a model predictive control problem. The resulting
policy is shown to preserve the dual control effect for a broad class of
predictive models with both continuous and categorical uncertainty. To ensure
the safe operation of the interacting agents, we leverage a supervisory control
scheme, oftentimes referred to as ``shielding'', which overrides the ego
agent's dual control policy with a safety fallback strategy when a
safety-critical event is imminent. We then augment the dual control framework
with an improved variant of the recently proposed shielding-aware robust
planning scheme, which proactively balances the nominal planning performance
with the risk of high-cost emergency maneuvers triggered by low-probability
opponent's behaviors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with both
simulated driving examples and hardware experiments using 1/10 scale autonomous

on only a few samples. Apart from basic content generation, a bunch of
downstream applications hopefully benefit from this task, such as low-data
detection and few-shot classification. To achieve this goal, the generated
images should guarantee category retention for classification beyond the visual
quality and diversity. In our preliminary work, we present an ``editing-based''
framework Attribute Group Editing (AGE) for reliable few-shot image generation,
which largely improves the generation performance. Nevertheless, AGE's
performance on downstream classification is not as satisfactory as expected.
This paper investigates the class inconsistency problem and proposes Stable
Attribute Group Editing (SAGE) for more stable class-relevant image generation.
SAGE takes use of all given few-shot images and estimates a class center
embedding based on the category-relevant attribute dictionary. Meanwhile,
according to the projection weights on the category-relevant attribute
dictionary, we can select category-irrelevant attributes from the similar seen
categories. Consequently, SAGE injects the whole distribution of the novel
class into StyleGAN's latent space, thus largely remains the category retention
and stability of the generated images. Going one step further, we find that
class inconsistency is a common problem in GAN-generated images for downstream
classification. Even though the generated images look photo-realistic and
requires no category-relevant editing, they are usually of limited help for
downstream classification. We systematically discuss this issue from both the
generative model and classification model perspectives, and propose to boost
the downstream classification performance of SAGE by enhancing the pixel and
frequency components.

with the scale free continuity expected for galaxies formed under gravity, as

dispersion $\sigma$, quite the opposite of standard expectations, but
indicative of dark matter in a Bose-Einstein state, where the Uncertainty
Principle requires $R_c \times \sigma$ is fixed by Planks constant, $h$. The
corresponding boson mass, $m_b=h/R_c \sigma$, differs by one order of magnitude
between the UDF and dSph classes, with $10^{-21.4}$eV and $10^{-20.3}$eV

focusing is habitually understood in a familiar single-particle picture of
carriers injected from a source, following ballistic cyclotron orbits and
reaching a detector. We report on a distinctive nonlocal magnetoresistance
phenomenon exclusive to fermions, in an enclosed mesoscopic geometry wherein
transverse focusing magnetoresistance peaks also occur at values of the
cyclotron diameter that are incommensurate with the distance between the source
and detector. In low-temperature experiments and simulations using GaAs/AlGaAs
heterostructures with high electron mobility, we show that the peaks occur
independently of the location of the detector, and only depend on the
source-drain separation. We reproduce the experimental findings using
simulations of ballistic transport in both semiclassical and quantum-coherent
transport models. The periodicity of magnetic field at which the peaks occur is
matched to the lithographically defined device scale. It is found that, unlike
in transverse magnetic focusing, the magnetoresistance structure cannot be
attributed to any set of ordered single-particle trajectories but instead
requires accounting for the collective dynamics of the fermion distribution and
of all particle trajectories. The magnetoresistance is further associated with
current flow vorticity, a collective phenomenon.

and diffusion properties in Fe-Ni alloys with a focus on the magnetochemical
effects. The results are derived from density functional theory (DFT)
calculations and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations using a DFT-parametrized
effective interaction model (EIM) with explicit atomic and spin variables. The
first part of this work is focused on thermodynamics. We compute via DFT
energetic, magnetic and vibrational properties and the bcc-fcc phase diagram,
revealing the relative importance between magnetic and vibrational entropies.
Combining MC simulations with the EIM, we obtain an fcc phase diagram across
the Curie points. We also discuss Mn and Cr effects on phase stability. The
second part of the work is dedicated to point-defect properties. We develop MC
schemes to compute vacancy formation free energy in alloys. We show that
vacancy formation in fcc Fe and Ni exhibits features that are well distinct
from those in bcc Fe. The results in fcc Fe-Ni alloys reveal that magnetic
disorder tends to increase vacancy formation free energy, while chemical
disorder shows an opposite effect. We also study magnetic effects on the
properties of self-interstitials in fcc Fe and Ni. The final part of the work
is devoted to vacancy-mediated diffusion. We evaluate diffusion properties over
the whole concentration range, probe into the magnetochemical effects on
diffusion. This work fully takes into account the impacts of transversal and
longitudinal spin fluctuations and the magnetochemical interplay. It provides
an accurate and consistent prediction of thermodynamic, defect formation and
diffusion properties in the Fe-Ni system, and contributes to a better
understanding of effects of magnetism in austenitic steels. The applied
approach is also transferable to the investigation of other magnetic alloys.

inference pose a significant challenge to the real-world deployment of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs). While quantization is a powerful approach to reducing
GNNs complexity, most previous works on GNNs quantization fail to exploit the
unique characteristics of GNNs, suffering from severe accuracy degradation.
Through an in-depth analysis of the topology of GNNs, we observe that the
topology of the graph leads to significant differences between nodes, and most
of the nodes in a graph appear to have a small aggregation value. Motivated by
this, in this paper, we propose the Aggregation-Aware mixed-precision
Quantization ($\rm A^2Q$) for GNNs, where an appropriate bitwidth is
automatically learned and assigned to each node in the graph. To mitigate the
vanishing gradient problem caused by sparse connections between nodes, we
propose a Local Gradient method to serve the quantization error of the node
features as the supervision during training. We also develop a Nearest Neighbor
Strategy to deal with the generalization on unseen graphs. Extensive
experiments on eight public node-level and graph-level datasets demonstrate the
generality and robustness of our proposed method. Compared to the FP32 models,
our method can achieve up to a 18.6x (i.e., 1.70bit) compression ratio with
negligible accuracy degradation. Morever, compared to the state-of-the-art

which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus
reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy

ELS can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy

thousands of short-period variables and eclipsing binaries since 2020. In this
paper, we present the observed properties of 125 flare stars identified by the
TMTS within the first two years, with an attempt to constrain their eruption
physics. As expected, most of these flares were recorded in late-type red stars
with $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}$ > 2.0 mag, however, the flares associated with
bluer stars tend to be on average more energetic and have broader profiles. The
peak flux (F_peak) of the flare is found to depend strongly on the equivalent
duration (ED) of the energy release, i.e., $F_{{\rm peak}} \propto {\rm
ED}^{0.72\pm0.04}$, which is consistent with results derived from the Kepler
and Evryscope samples. This relation is likely related to the magnetic loop
emission, while -- for the more popular non-thermal electron heating model -- a
specific time evolution may be required to generate this relation. We notice
that flares produced by hotter stars have a flatter $F_{{\rm peak}} \propto
{\rm ED}$ relation compared to that from cooler stars. This is related to the
statistical discrepancy in light-curve shape of flare events with different
colors. In spectra from LAMOST, we find that flare stars have apparently
stronger H alpha emission than inactive stars, especially at the low
temperature end, suggesting that chromospheric activity plays an important role
in producing flares. On the other hand, the subclass having frequent flares are
found to show H alpha emission of similar strength in their spectra to that
recorded with only a single flare but similar effective temperature, implying
that the chromospheric activity may not be the only trigger for eruptions.

well described by $L_{\rm p}\propto T^{5.96\pm 0.64}R^{2.24\pm 0.18}$, where
$T$ and $R$ are the surface temperature and the emitting-region radius of the
surface thermal emission, represented by the black-body component in the
spectral model. $\Gamma_{\rm p}$, on the other hand, can be well described only
when timing variables are included, and the relation is $\Gamma_{\rm p} =
\log(T^{-5.8\pm 1.93}R^{-2.29\pm 0.85}P^{-1.19\pm 0.88}\dot{P}^{0.94\pm 0.44})$
plus a constant. These relations strongly suggest the existence of connections
between surface thermal emission and electron-positron pair production in
pulsar magnetospheres.

into convergence and generalization properties of neural networks in the
over-parametrized (wide) limit by approximating the network using a first-order
Taylor expansion with respect to its weights in the neighborhood of their
initialization values. This allows neural network training to be analyzed from
the perspective of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), which is
informative in the over-parametrized regime, but a poor approximation for
narrower networks as the weights change more during training. Our goal is to
extend beyond the limits of NTK toward a more general theory. We construct an
exact power-series representation of the neural network in a finite
neighborhood of the initial weights as an inner product of two feature maps,
respectively from data and weight-step space, to feature space, allowing neural
network training to be analyzed from the perspective of reproducing kernel {\em
Banach} space (RKBS). We prove that, regardless of width, the training sequence
produced by gradient descent can be exactly replicated by regularized
sequential learning in RKBS. Using this, we present novel bound on uniform
convergence where the iterations count and learning rate play a central role,
giving new theoretical insight into neural network training.

Specifically, for the noninvasive extraction of fetal cardiac signals from

to extract the complete fetal ECG components. From previous studies, it is now
believed that a carefully selected array of electrodes well-placed over the
abdomen of a pregnant woman contains the required `information' for BSS, to
extract the complete fetal components. Based on this idea, in previous works
array recording systems and sensor selection strategies based on the Mutual

works have been extended, by considering the 3-dimensional aspects of the
cardiac electrical activity. The proposed method has been tested on simulated

selection strategy together with the MI criterion, can be effectively used to
select the channels containing the most `information' concerning the fetal ECG

useful for the selection of the most informative channels in online

proposes FS-GAN, a federated self-supervised learning framework to support
automatic traffic analysis and synthesis over a large number of heterogeneous
datasets. FS-GAN is composed of multiple distributed Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), with a set of generators, each being designed to generate
synthesized data samples following the distribution of an individual service
traffic, and each discriminator being trained to differentiate the synthesized
data samples and the real data samples of a local dataset. A federated
learning-based framework is adopted to coordinate local model training
processes of different GANs across different datasets. FS-GAN can classify data
of unknown types of service and create synthetic samples that capture the
traffic distribution of the unknown types. We prove that FS-GAN can minimize
the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the distribution of real data
across all the datasets and that of the synthesized data samples. FS-GAN also
maximizes the JSD among the distributions of data samples created by different
generators, resulting in each generator producing synthetic data samples that
follow the same distribution as one particular service type. Extensive
simulation results show that the classification accuracy of FS-GAN achieves
over 20% improvement in average compared to the state-of-the-art

synthesize highly complex mixtures of traffic types without requiring any

certified region is to use an input-specific algorithm instead of using a fixed
Gaussian filter for all data points. Several methods based on this idea have
been proposed, but they either suffer from high computational costs or gain
marginal improvement in certified radius. In this work, we show that by
exploiting the quasiconvex problem structure, we can find the optimal certified
radii for most data points with slight computational overhead. This observation
leads to an efficient and effective input-specific randomized smoothing
algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments and empirical analysis on Cifar10

be used to compare attack severity and also assist attacker in determining
whether it is profitable to conduct an attack. The experiment results show that
1) An attacker with more than 30% computing power can get huge profit and
extremely downgrade system throughput by launching stubborn mining attack. 2) A
rational attacker should not launch stubborn mining attack if it has less than

western limb in the field of view of SDO/AIA. The prominence is supported by a
highly twisted magnetic flux rope and shows rapid rotation in the
counterclockwise direction during the rising motion. The rotation of the
prominence lasts for $\sim$47 minutes. The average period, angular speed, and
linear speed are $\sim$806 s, $\sim$0.46 rad min$^{-1}$, and $\sim$355 km
s$^{-1}$, respectively. The total twist angle reaches $\sim$7$\pi$, which is
considerably larger than the threshold for kink instability. Writhing motion
during 17:42$-$17:46 UT is clearly observed by SWAP in 174 {\AA} and EUVI on
board the behind STEREO spacecraft in 304 {\AA} after reaching an apparent
height of $\sim$405\,Mm. Therefore, the prominence eruption is most probably
triggered by kink instability. A pair of conjugate flare ribbons and post-flare
loops are created and observed by STA/EUVI. The onset time of writhing motion
is consistent with the commencement of the impulsive phase of the related
flare. The 3D morphology and positions of the associated CME are derived using
the graduated cylindrical shell (GCS) modeling. The kinetic evolution of the
reconstructed CME is divided into a slow-rise phase ($\sim$330 km s$^{-1}$) and
a fast-rise phase ($\sim$1005 km s$^{-1}$) by the writhing motion. The edge-on
angular width of the CME is a constant (60$^{\circ}$), while the face-on
angular width increases from 96$^{\circ}$ to 114$^{\circ}$, indicating a
lateral expansion. The latitude of the CME source region decreases slightly
from $\sim$18$^{\circ}$ to $\sim$13$^{\circ}$, implying an equatorward
deflection during propagation.

nuclei with a quadrupole deformation (which have ordinary $T$,$P$-conserving
collective electric quadrupole moments). Nuclei with an octupole deformation
have a collective electric octupole moment, electric dipole moment (EDM),
Schiff moment and MQM in the intrinsic frame which rotates with the nucleus. In
a state with definite angular momentum in the laboratory frame, these moments
are forbidden by $T$ and $P$ conservation, meaning their expectation values
vanish due to nuclear rotation. However, nuclei with an octupole deformation
have doublets of close opposite parity rotational states with the same spin,
which are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the
orientation of the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, and all moments
existing in the intrinsic frame appear in the laboratory frame (provided the
nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large to allow such a moment). Such a
mechanism produces enhanced $T$,$P$-violating nuclear moments. This enhancement

Recently, KDG has achieved considerable progress with many studies proposed. In
this survey, we systematically review these works. Specifically, we first
introduce KDG challenges and bases, then categorize and summarize existing
works of KDG by answering the following three questions: 1) what to distillate,
2) who to whom, and 3) how to distillate. Finally, we share our thoughts on
future research directions.

the ""Scopeformer,"" a novel multi-CNN-ViT model for intracranial hemorrhage
classification in computed tomography (CT) images. The Scopeformer architecture
is scalable and modular, which allows utilizing various CNN architectures as
the backbone with diversified output features and pre-training strategies. We
propose effective feature projection methods to reduce redundancies among
CNN-generated features and to control the input size of ViTs. Extensive
experiments with various Scopeformer models show that the model performance is
proportional to the number of convolutional blocks employed in the feature
extractor. Using multiple strategies, including diversifying the pre-training
paradigms for CNNs, different pre-training datasets, and style transfer
techniques, we demonstrate an overall improvement in the model performance at
various computational budgets. Later, we propose smaller compute-efficient
Scopeformer versions with three different types of input and output ViT
configurations. Efficient Scopeformers use four different pre-trained CNN
architectures as feature extractors to increase feature richness. Our best
Efficient Scopeformer model achieved an accuracy of 96.94\% and a weighted
logarithmic loss of 0.083 with an eight times reduction in the number of
trainable parameters compared to the base Scopeformer. Another version of the
Efficient Scopeformer model further reduced the parameter space by almost 17
times with negligible performance reduction. Hybrid CNNs and ViTs might provide
the desired feature richness for developing accurate medical computer vision

error-correction protocols based on superpositions of mechanical coherent

mechanical oscillator. Of particular interest are two-level system (TLS)
defects in the resonator host material, which have been widely studied in the
classical domain, primarily via measurements of the material loss tangent. In
this manuscript, we use a superconducting qubit as a quantum sensor to perform
phonon number-resolved measurements on a phononic crystal cavity. This enables
a high-resolution study of mechanical dissipation and dephasing in coherent
states of variable size (mean phonon number $\navg\simeq1-10$). We observe
nonexponential energy decay and a state size-dependent reduction of the
dephasing rate, which we attribute to interactions with TLS. Using a numerical
model, we reproduce the energy decay signatures (and to a lesser extent, the
dephasing signatures) via mechanical emission into a small ensemble ($N=5$) of
saturable and rapidly dephasing TLS. Our findings comprise a detailed
examination of TLS-induced phonon decoherence in the quantum regime.

Some of the Raman mode frequencies exhibit anomalous temperature dependence due

Conventionally, the problem of 6D localization using antenna arrays has been
considered difficult and was solved through a combination of heuristics and
optimization. In this paper, we reveal a close connection between the AoA and
AoD and the well-studied perspective projection model from computer vision.
This connection allows us to solve the 6D localization problem, by adapting
state-of-the-art methods from computer vision. More specifically, two problems,

demonstrates the potential for energy-efficient training of SNNs. Specifically,
we introduce ternary spiking neuron couples and prove that implicit
differentiation can be solved by spikes based on this design, so the whole
training procedure, including both forward and backward passes, is made as
event-driven spike computation, and weights are updated locally with two-stage
average firing rates. Then we propose to modify the reset membrane potential to
reduce the approximation error of spikes. With these key components, we can
train SNNs with flexible structures in a small number of time steps and with
firing sparsity during training, and the theoretical estimation of energy costs

We propose a novel statistical model that decomposes the document embeddings
into a linear superposition of two vectors; a latent neutral \emph{context}
vector independent of ideology, and a latent \emph{position} vector aligned
with ideology. We train an end-to-end model that has intermediate contextual
and positional vectors as outputs. At deployment time, our model predicts
labels for input documents by exclusively leveraging the predicted positional
vectors. On two benchmark datasets we show that our model is capable of
outputting predictions even when trained with as little as 5\% biased data, and
is significantly more accurate than the state-of-the-art. Through
crowd-sourcing we validate the neutrality of contextual vectors, and show that
context filtering results in ideological concentration, allowing for prediction
on out-of-distribution examples.

  Joint Scheduling of Truck Routing and Charging",,,,,"eess.SY cs.CY cs.SY math.CO math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The timely transportation of goods to customers is an essential component of
economic activities. However, heavy-duty diesel trucks that deliver goods
contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions within many large
metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles, New York, and San Francisco. To
facilitate freight electrification, this paper proposes joint routing and
charging (JRC) scheduling for electric trucks. The objective of the associated
optimization problem is to minimize the cost of transportation, charging, and
tardiness. As a result of a large number of combinations of road segments,
electric trucks can take a large number of combinations of possible charging
decisions and charging duration as well. The resulting mixed-integer linear
programming problem (MILP) is extremely challenging because of the
combinatorial complexity even in the deterministic case. Therefore, a
Level-Based Surrogate Lagrangian Relaxation method is employed to decompose and
coordinate the overall problem into truck subproblems that are significantly
less complex. In the coordination aspect, each truck subproblem is solved
independently of other subproblems based on charging cost, tardiness, and the
values of Lagrangian multipliers. In addition to serving as a means of guiding
and coordinating trucks, multipliers can also serve as a basis for transparent
and explanatory decision-making by trucks. Testing results demonstrate that
even small instances cannot be solved using the over-the-shelf solver CPLEX
after several days of solving. The new method, on the other hand, can obtain
near-optimal solutions within a few minutes for small cases, and within 30
minutes for large ones. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that as battery
capacity increases, the total cost decreases significantly; moreover, as the
charging power increases, the number of trucks required decreases as well.

opening burgeoning opportunities for a wide variety of applications.
Importantly, the flexible manipulation the various properties of such beams

demonstrate a longitudinal spin-orbit separation of complex vector modes
propagating in free space. To achieve this we employed the recently
demonstrated circular Airy Gaussian vortex vector (CAGVV) modes, which feature
a self-focusing property. More precisely, by properly manipulating the
intrinsic parameters of CAGVV modes, the strong coupling between the two
constituting orthogonal components of CAGVV mode undergo a spin-orbit
separation along the propagation direction namely, while one polarisation
component, focuses at a specific plane, the other focuses at a different plane.
Such spin-orbit separation, which we demonstrated by numerical simulations and
corroborated experimentally, can be adjusted on-demand by simply changing the
initial parameters of CAGVV modes. Our findings will be of great relevance, for
example in optical tweezers, to manipulate micro- or nano-particles at two
different parallel planes.

Dynamic TSP, in which a system with dynamic constraints is tasked with visiting
a set of n target locations (in any order) in the shortest amount of time. Such
tasks arise naturally in many robotic motion planning problems, particularly in
exploration, surveillance and reconnaissance, and classical TSP algorithms on
graphs are typically inapplicable in this setting. An important question about
such problems is: if the target points are random, what is the length of the
tour (either in expectation or as a concentration bound) as n grows? This
problem is the Dynamic Stochastic TSP (DSTSP), and has been studied both for
specific important vehicle models and for general dynamic systems; however, in
general only the order of growth is known. In this work, we explore the
connection between the distribution from which the targets are drawn and the
dynamics of the system, yielding a more precise lower bound on tour length as
well as a matching upper bound for the case of symmetric (or driftless)
systems. We then extend the symmetric dynamics results to the case when the
points are selected by a (non-random) adversary whose goal is to maximize the
length, thus showing worst-case bounds on the tour length.

selection -- which aims to select a proper subset of the candidate cuts to
improve the efficiency of solving MILPs -- heavily depends on (P1) which cuts
should be preferred, and (P2) how many cuts should be selected. Although many
modern MILP solvers tackle (P1)-(P2) by manually designed heuristics, machine
learning offers a promising approach to learn more effective heuristics from
MILPs collected from specific applications. However, many existing
learning-based methods focus on learning which cuts should be preferred,
neglecting the importance of learning the number of cuts that should be
selected. Moreover, we observe from extensive empirical results that (P3) what
order of selected cuts should be preferred has a significant impact on the
efficiency of solving MILPs as well. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel hierarchical sequence model (HEM) to learn cut selection policies via
reinforcement learning. Specifically, HEM consists of a two-level model: (1) a
higher-level model to learn the number of cuts that should be selected, (2) and
a lower-level model -- that formulates the cut selection task as a sequence to
sequence learning problem -- to learn policies selecting an ordered subset with
the size determined by the higher-level model. To the best of our knowledge,
HEM is the first method that can tackle (P1)-(P3) in cut selection
simultaneously from a data-driven perspective. Experiments show that HEM
significantly improves the efficiency of solving MILPs compared to
human-designed and learning-based baselines on both synthetic and large-scale
real-world MILPs, including MIPLIB 2017. Moreover, experiments demonstrate that
HEM well generalizes to MILPs that are significantly larger than those seen

\leq \frac{\epsilon}{\sqrt{d}}\cdot \|Ax^*-b\|_2\cdot \|A^\dagger\|$ where
$x^*=\arg\min_{x\in \mathbb{R}^d}\|Ax-b\|_2$. One popular approach for solving
such $\ell_2$ regression problem is via sketching: picking a structured random
matrix $S\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ with $m\ll n$ and $SA$ can be quickly
computed, solve the ``sketched'' regression problem $\arg\min_{x\in

such $\ell_\infty$ guarantee for $\ell_2$ regression, one has to use sketching

we prove that there exists a distribution of dense sketching matrices with
$m=\epsilon^{-2}d\log^3(n/\delta)$ such that solving the sketched regression
problem gives the $\ell_\infty$ guarantee, with probability at least
$1-\delta$. Moreover, the matrix $SA$ can be computed in time $O(nd\log n)$.
Our row count is nearly-optimal up to logarithmic factors, and significantly
improves the result in [Price, Song and Woodruff, ICALP'17], in which a
super-linear in $d$ rows, $m=\Omega(\epsilon^{-2}d^{1+\gamma})$ for

a novel analytical framework for $\ell_\infty$ guarantee regression that
utilizes the Oblivious Coordinate-wise Embedding (OCE) property introduced in

than [Price, Song and Woodruff, ICALP'17], and it extends to dense sketches for

considering a small negative one-proton separation energy and a possible
enhanced contribution from the $p$-wave component. The present method predicts
that $^{71}$Sr and $^{74}$Zr may be the most promising candidates for future
study on $2p$ radioactivity. Our model gives an upper limit of 55(4) keV for

new excursion event of SMC X-1 in 2020--2021, indicating that the superorbital
modulation has an unpredictable, chaotic nature. We trace the spin-period
evolution and find that the spin-up rate accelerated one year before the onset
of this new excursion, which suggests a possible inside-out process connecting
the spin-up acceleration and the superorbital excursion. This results in a
deviation of the spin period residual, similar to the behaviour of the first
excursion in 1996--1998. In further analysis of the pulse profile evolution, we
find that the pulsed fraction shows a long-term evolution and may be connected
to the superorbital excursion. These discoveries deepen the mystery of SMC X-1

multi-wavelength observations in 46 nearby galaxies, uniformly processed with a
common physical resolution of $2~$kpc. A physical dust model is used to fit the
infrared dust emission spectral energy distribution (SED) observed with WISE
and Herschel. The star formation rate (SFR) is traced with GALEX ultraviolet
data corrected by WISE infrared. We find that the dust temperature correlates
well with the SFR surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), which traces the
radiation from young stars. The dust temperature decreases with increasing D/G
at fixed $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ as expected from stronger dust shielding at high
D/G, when $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ is higher than $\sim 2\times 10^{-3}~\rm
M_\odot~yr^{-1}~kpc^{-2}$. These measurements are in good agreement with the
dust temperature predicted by our proposed analytical model. Below this range
of $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$, the observed dust temperature is higher than the
model prediction and is only weakly dependent on D/G, which is possibly due to
the dust heating from old stellar population or the variation of SFR within the
past $10^{10}~$yr. Overall, the dust temperature as a function of
$\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ and $\Sigma_\mathrm{dust}$ predicted by our analytical
model is consistent with observations. We also notice that at fixed gas surface
density, $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ tends to increase with D/G, i.e. we can empirically

many statistical applications. Unfortunately, the Student's $t$ distribution is
not closed under convolution, thus, deriving an exact and general distribution
for the linear combination of $K$ Student's $t$ RVs is infeasible, which
motivates a fitting/approximation approach. Here, we focus on the scenario
where the only constraint is that the number of degrees of freedom of each
$t-$RV is greater than two. Notice that since the odd moments/cumulants of the
Student's $t$ distribution are zero, and the even moments/cumulants do not
exist when their order is greater than the number of degrees of freedom, it
becomes impossible to use conventional approaches based on moments/cumulants of
order one or higher than two. To circumvent this issue, herein we propose
fitting such a distribution to that of a scaled Student's $t$ RV by exploiting
the second moment together with either the first absolute moment or the
characteristic function (CF). For the fitting based on the absolute moment, we
depart from the case of the linear combination of $K= 2$ Student's $t$ RVs and
then generalize to $K\ge 2$ through a simple iterative procedure. Meanwhile,
the CF-based fitting is direct, but its accuracy (measured in terms of the
Bhattacharyya distance metric) depends on the CF parameter configuration, for
which we propose a simple but accurate approach. We numerically show that the
CF-based fitting usually outperforms the absolute moment -based fitting and
that both the scale and number of degrees of freedom of the fitting
distribution increase almost linearly with $K$.

training semantic encoder/decoder models of semantic communication systems,
without private user data leaving the devices. Most existing studies on
trustworthy FL aim to eliminate data poisoning threats that are produced by
malicious clients, but in many cases, eliminating model poisoning attacks
brought by fake servers is also an important objective. In this paper, a
certificateless authentication-based trustworthy federated learning (CATFL)
framework is proposed, which mutually authenticates the identity of clients and
server. In CATFL, each client verifies the server's signature information
before accepting the delivered global model to ensure that the global model is
not delivered by false servers. On the contrary, the server also verifies the
server's signature information before accepting the delivered model updates to
ensure that they are submitted by authorized clients. Compared to PKI-based
methods, the CATFL can avoid too high certificate management overheads.
Meanwhile, the anonymity of clients shields data poisoning attacks, while
real-name registration may suffer from user-specific privacy leakage risks.
Therefore, a pseudonym generation strategy is also presented in CATFL to
achieve a trade-off between identity traceability and user anonymity, which is
essential to conditionally prevent from user-specific privacy leakage.
Theoretical security analysis and evaluation results validate the superiority
of CATFL.

serendipitously captured, to pre-SN HST F160W and F814W images from 2017 and

position from JWST. That star has a spectral energy distribution and overall
luminosity consistent with a single-star model having an initial mass somewhat
less than the canonical 8 Msun theoretical threshold for core collapse,

2022acko is a relatively normal SN II-P, albeit most likely a low-luminosity

are found to coalesce at film thicknesses of 0.6 nm and at 1.5 nm with
continuous film formation around film thicknesses of 1.5 nm and 3.0 nm for
smooth and rough substrates, respectively. Ferromagnetic long-range ordering
i.e., the appearance of a magnetic hysteresis loop in both films, is observed
just after coalescing stage. Observed azimuthal angular dependence of
coercivity confirmed the presence of a weak uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in
both films, whereas the difference in uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with
substrate roughness is interpreted in terms of the combined effect of domain
wall pinning and internal stresses in the films. The origin of much higher UMA
in the case of the Co film deposited on a ripple-patterned substrate of similar
root means square roughness is attributed to the modified long-range dipolar
stray fields on the surface.

interparticle tangential friction plays a crucial role in energy dissipation
during collisions between porous dust aggregates; however, the importance of
friction on the collisional growth of dust aggregates remains poorly

friction on the collisional growth of dust aggregates. We performed numerical
simulations of collisions between equal-mass porous dust aggregates consisting
of cohesive and frictionless spheres. We changed the collision velocity and
impact angle systematically and calculated the collisional growth efficiency as
a function of the collision velocity. We found that the threshold velocity for
collisional growth decreases when dust aggregates are made of frictionless
spheres as compared to frictional spheres. Our results highlight the importance
of tangential interactions on the collisional behavior of dust aggregates and
indicate that the predictive equation for threshold velocity should be
reconstructed.

  In this paper, we propose Xenos, which can automatically conduct
dataflow-centric optimization of the computation graph and accelerate inference
in two dimensions. Vertically, Xenos develops operator linking technique to
improve data locality by restructuring the inter-operator dataflow.
Horizontally, Xenos develops DSP-aware operator split technique to enable
higher parallelism across multiple DSP units. Our evaluation proves the
effectiveness of vertical and horizontal dataflow optimization, which reduce

Compared with Fe growth on Si substrate, where film exhibits a hyperfine field

electron density and hyperfine fields providing evidence of deep penetration of
Fe atoms into Alq3 film. Due to the soft nature of Alq3, Fe moments relax in
the film plane. At the same time, Fe on Si has a resultant ~43 deg out-of-plane
orientation of Fe moments at the Interface due to the stressed and rough Fe

using in-situ magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) during the growth of Fe on the

that the Fe atom tries to organize into clusters to minimize their

several solar radio bursts not limited to type II, type III, and type V. A
vigorous case study was conducted on two selected radio burst events to
validate the authenticity of the recorded events. Other solar radio stations at
different geographical locations recorded all the radio bursts detected by the
spectrometer. The case study included brief analyses that indicated a type II
radio burst observed on October 09, 2021, between 06:30 and 07:00 UT, was
associated with an M1.6 solar flare located at N18E08 within NOAA-AR 12882 and
a CME with a shock front speed of ~978 km/s. However, the type III radio burst
is neither CME nor solar flare associated. These analyses examine the

gravitational waves in a long-term core-collapse supernova simulation, with a
mass of 9.6 $M_\odot$. The simulation, which includes neutrino transport in
general relativity is performed from core-collapse, bounce, explosion and
cooling of protoneutron stars (PNSs) up to 20 s after the bounce
self-consistently. Based on the hydrodynamics background, we calculate
eigenmodes of the PNS oscillation through a perturbation analysis on fluid and
metric. We classify the modes by the number of nodes and find that there are
several eigenmodes. In the early phase before 1 s, there are a low-frequency
g-mode around 0.5 kHz, a mid-frequency f-modes around 1 kHz, and high-frequency
p-modes above them. Beyond 1 s, the g-modes drop too low in frequency and the
p-modes become too high to be detected by ground-based interferometers.
However, the f-mode persists at 1 kHz. We present a novel fitting formula for
the ramp-up mode, comprising a mixture of g-mode and f-mode, using postbounce
time as a fitting parameter. Our approach yields improved results for the
long-term simulation compared to prior quadratic formulas. We also fit
frequencies using combinations of gravitational mass and radius of the PNS. We
test three types of fitting variables: compactness, surface gravity, and
average density. We present results of the time evolution of each mode and the
fitting for three different ranges, from 0.2 to 1, 4, and 20 s for each
formula. We compare the deviation of the formulas from the eigenmodes to
determine which fitting formula is the best. In conclusion, any variable fits
the eigenmodes well to a similar degree. Comparing 3 variables in detail, the
fitting with compactness is slightly the best among them. We also find that the
fitting using less than 1 s of simulation data cannot be extrapolated to the
long-term frequency prediction.

functionally identical transformations between one representation and the next.
We here characterize the geometric and statistical properties of these
representations, focusing on the evolution of such proprieties across the
layers. By analyzing geometric properties such as the intrinsic dimension (ID)
and the neighbor composition we find that the representations evolve in a
strikingly similar manner in transformers trained on protein language tasks and
image reconstruction tasks. In the first layers, the data manifold expands,
becoming high-dimensional, and then it contracts significantly in the
intermediate layers. In the last part of the model, the ID remains
approximately constant or forms a second shallow peak. We show that the
semantic complexity of the dataset emerges at the end of the first peak. This
phenomenon can be observed across many models trained on diverse datasets.
Based on these observations, we suggest using the ID profile as an unsupervised

learning. Unfortunately, identifying the correct class label from a long
sequence of candidate labels is time-consuming and laborious. To alleviate this
problem, we design a novel labeling mechanism called stochastic label. In this
setting, stochastic label includes two cases: 1) identify a correct class label
from a small number of randomly given labels; 2) annotate the instance with
None label when given labels do not contain correct class label. In this paper,
we propose a novel suitable approach to learn from these stochastic labels. We
obtain an unbiased estimator that utilizes less supervised information in
stochastic labels to train a multi-class classifier. Additionally, it is
theoretically justifiable by deriving the estimation error bound of the
proposed method. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on widely-used
benchmark datasets to validate the superiority of our method by comparing it
with existing state-of-the-art methods.

nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation on a one-dimensional torus with forcing and

Depending on the existence of zeroes of the effective potential $V_\text{eff}$,

stationary solutions from $\epsilon=0$ can be continued locally into the range
$\epsilon\not =0$. Moreover, the extremal points of the $\epsilon$-continued

eigenvalue on the imaginary axis, we can prove asymptotic stability or

quantum information science, but they are generally less understood at material
interfaces than in deposited films. Here we study surface TLSs at the metal-air
interface, by probing them using a quasi-uniform field within vacuum-gap (VG)
capacitors of resonators. The VG capacitor has a nano-gap which creates an
order-of-magnitude larger contribution from the metal-air interface than
typical resonators used in circuit QED. We measure three phenomena and find
qualitative agreement with an interacting TLS model, where near-resonant TLSs
experience substantial frequency jitter from the state switching of far-detuned
low-frequency TLSs. First, we find that the loss in all of our VG resonators is
weakly or logarithmically power dependent, in contrast to data from deposited
dielectric films. Second, we add a saturation tone with power $P_{in}$ to a
transmission measurement and obtain the TLS Rabi frequency $\Omega_{0}$. These
data show a substantially weaker $P_{in}$ dependence of $\Omega_{0}$ than the
prediction from the standard non-interacting TLS model. Lastly, we increase the
temperature and find an increased TLS jitter rate and dephasing rate from
power-dependent loss and phase noise measurements, respectively. We also anneal
samples, which lowers the low-frequency TLS density and jitter rate, but the
single-photon loss is found to be unchanged. The results are qualitatively

obtaining latent representations based on large-scale data, can be a potential
solution for the discovery of a novel aging biomarker, existing deep learning
methods for biological age estimation usually depend on chronological ages and
lack of consideration of mortality and morbidity that are the most significant
outcomes of aging. Methods: This paper proposes a novel deep learning model to
learn latent representations of biological aging in regard to subjects'
morbidity and mortality. The model utilizes health check-up data in addition to
morbidity and mortality information to learn the complex relationships between
aging and measured clinical attributes. Findings: The proposed model is
evaluated on a large dataset of general populations compared with KDM and other

the fairness of an allocation rule by comparing their received utilities to a
benchmark share - a function only of her own valuation and the number of
agents. This share is called a guarantee if for any profile of valuations there
is an allocation ensuring the share of every agent. When the objects are
indivisible goods, Budish [J. Political Econ., 2011] proposed MaxMinShare,
i.e., the least utility of a bundle in the best partition of the objects, which
is unfortunately not a guarantee. Instead, an earlier pioneering work by Hill
[Ann. Probab., 1987] proposed for a share the worst-case MaxMinShare over all
valuations with the same largest possible single-object value. Although Hill's
share is more conservative than the MaxMinShare, it is an actual guarantee and
its computation is elementary, unlike that of the MaxMinShare which involves
solving an NP-hard problem. We apply Hill's approach to the allocation of
indivisible bads (objects with disutilities or costs), and characterise the
tight closed form of the worst-case MinMaxShare for a given value of the worst
bad. We argue that Hill's share for allocating bads is effective in the sense
of being close to the original MinMaxShare value, and there is much to learn
about the guarantee an agent can be offered from the disutility of her worst
single bad. Furthermore, we prove that the monotonic cover of Hill's share is
the best guarantee that can be achieved in Hill's model for all allocation
instances.

increasingly important to test and improve ASR systems. However, collecting and
executing speech test cases is usually expensive and time-consuming, motivating
us to strategically prioritize speech test cases. A key question is: how to
determine the ideal order of collecting and executing speech test cases to
uncover more errors as early as possible? Each speech test case consists of a
piece of audio and the corresponding reference text. In this work, we propose
PROPHET (PRiOritizing sPeecH tEsT), a tool that predicts potential
error-uncovering speech test cases only based on their reference texts. Thus,
PROPHET analyzes test cases and prioritizes them without running the ASR
system, which can analyze speech test cases at a large scale. We evaluate 6
different prioritization methods on 3 ASR systems and 12 datasets. Given the
same testing budget, we find that our approach uncovers 12.63% more wrongly
recognized words than the state-of-the-art method. We select test cases from
the prioritized list to fine-tune ASR systems and analyze how our approach can
improve the ASR system performance. Statistical tests show that our proposed
method can bring significantly larger performance improvement to ASR systems
than the existing baseline methods. Furthermore, we perform correlation
analysis and confirm that fine-tuning an ASR system using a dataset, on which
the model performs worse, tends to improve the performance more.

with contactless actuators and a pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS) to drive the
correction chain. The key point is the synergy between them: the sensitivity of
the PWFS and the intrinsic stability of a contactless-actuated mirror segment.
  Voice-coil, contactless actuators are in facts a natural decoupling layer
between the payload and the optical surface and can suppress the high frequency
vibration as we verified in the lab. We subjected a 40 cm diameter prototype
with 19 actuators to an externally injected vibration spectrum; we then
measured optically the reduction of vibrations when the optical surface is
floating controlled by the actuators, thus validating the concept at the first
stage of the design.
  The PWFS, which is largely adopted on ground-based telescope, is a
pupil-conjugated sensor and offers a user-selectable sampling and capture
range, in order to match different use cases; it is also more sensitive than
Shack-Hartmann sensor especially at the low-mid spatial scales. We run a set of
numerical simulations with the PWFS measuring the misalignment and phase steps
of a JWST-like primary mirrors: we investigated the PWFS sensitivity in the
sub-nanometer regime in presence of photon and detector noise, and with guide
star magnitudes in the range 8 to 14.

different authentication methods, including 802.1X authentication. We show that
802.1X has improved security through the use of digital certificates but does
not define any practical technique for the user to check the network
certificate. Therefore, it remains vulnerable to the evil twin attack. To
repair this vulnerability, we introduce Robust Certificate Management System
(RCMS) which takes advantage of the digital certificates of 802.1X to protect
the users against rogue APs. RCMS defines a new verification code to allow the
user device to check the network certificate. This practical verification
combined with the reliability of digital certificates provides a perfect
protection against rogue APs. RCMS requires a small software update on the user
terminal and does not need any modification of IEEE 802.11. It has a
significant flexibility since trusting a single AP is enough to trust all the
APs of the extended network. This allows the administrators to extend their
networks easily without the need to update any database of trusted APs on the
user devices.

safety cameras). However, more recently, methodology has been developed to
predict collision counts at potential hotspots in future time periods, with a
view to a more proactive treatment of road safety hotspots. Dynamic linear

such a proactive treatment. In this paper, we demonstrate how such models can
be used to capture both seasonal variability and spatial dependence in time
course collision rates at several locations. The model allows for within- and
out-of-sample forecasting for locations which are fully observed and for
locations where some data are missing. We illustrate our approach using

arrangement, a particular notion of freeness. In this paper, we consider a
special subclass, where the property of accuracy stems from a flag of flats in
the intersection lattice of the underlying arrangement. Members of this family
are called flag-accurate. One relevance of this new notion is that it entails
divisional freeness. There are a number of important natural classes which are
flag-accurate, the most prominent one among them is the one consisting of
Coxeter arrangements. This warrants a systematic study which is put forward in
the present paper. More specifically, let $\mathscr A$ be a free arrangement of
rank $\ell$. Suppose that for every $1\leq d \leq \ell$, the first $d$
exponents of $\mathscr A$ -- when listed in increasing order -- are realized as
the exponents of a free restriction of $\mathscr A$ to some intersection of
reflecting hyperplanes of $\mathscr A$ of dimension $d$. Following [MR21], we
call such an arrangement $\mathscr A$ with this natural property accurate. If
in addition the flats involved can be chosen to form a flag, we call $\mathscr
A$ flag-accurate. We investigate flag-accuracy among reflection arrangements,
extended Shi and extended Catalan arrangements, and further for various
families of graphic and digraphic arrangements. We pursue these both from
theoretical and computational perspectives. Along the way we present examples
of accurate arrangements that are not flag-accurate. The main result of [MR21]
shows that MAT-free arrangements are accurate. We provide strong evidence for
the conjecture that MAT-freeness actually entails flag-accuracy.

that end, researchers study incremental learning, where a learner is required
to adapt to an incoming stream of data with a varying distribution while
preventing forgetting of past knowledge. Significant progress has been made,

observations, is usually performed by Kriging, being the best linear unbiased
predictor (BLUP) in a least-square sense. In order to predict a continuous
surface over a spatial domain a grid representation is most often used. Kriging
predictions and prediction variances are computed in the nodes of a grid
covering the spatial domain, and the continuous surface is assessed from this
grid representation. A precise representation usually requires the number of
grid nodes to be considerably larger than the number of observations. For a
Gaussian random field model the Kriging predictor coinsides with the
conditional expectation of the spatial variable given the observation set. An
alternative expression for this conditional expectation provides a spatial
predictor on functional form which does not rely on a spatial grid
discretization. This functional predictor, called the Kernel predictor, is
identical to the asymptotic grid infill limit of the Kriging-based grid
representation, and the computational demand is primarily dependent on the
number of observations - not the dimension of the spatial reference domain nor
any grid discretization. We explore the potential of this Kernel predictor with
associated prediction variances. The predictor is valid for Gaussian random
fields with any eligible spatial correlation function, and large computational
savings can be obtained by using a finite-range spatial correlation function.
For studies with a huge set of observations, localized predictors must be used,
and the computational advantage relative to Kriging predictors can be very
large. Moreover, model parameter inference based on a huge observation set can
be efficiently made. The methodology is demonstrated in a couple of examples.

Moreover, also typically the inner product is changed to a discrete inner
product, which is the finite sum of weighted functions evaluated in specific
nodes. For particular applications it is beneficial to have an efficient
procedure to update the recurrence relations when adding or removing nodes from
the inner product. The construction of the recurrence relations is equivalent
to computing a structured matrix (polynomial) or pencil (rational) having
prescribed spectral properties. Hence the solution of this problem is often
referred to as solving an Inverse Eigenvalue Problem. In Van Buggenhout et al.

efficiently updating the recurrences. To complete this study we present in this

deflate eigenvalues is exploited to develop efficient algorithms. We will base

  Algorithms and Applications",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC cs.IR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Link streams offer a good model for representing interactions over time. They
consist of links $(b,e,u,v)$, where $u$ and $v$ are vertices interacting during
the whole time interval $[b,e]$. In this paper, we deal with the problem of
enumerating maximal cliques in link streams. A clique is a pair
$(C,[t_0,t_1])$, where $C$ is a set of vertices that all interact pairwise
during the full interval $[t_0,t_1]$. It is maximal when neither its set of
vertices nor its time interval can be increased. Some of the main works solving
this problem are based on the famous Bron-Kerbosch algorithm for enumerating
maximal cliques in graphs. We take this idea as a starting point to propose a
new algorithm which matches the cliques of the instantaneous graphs formed by
links existing at a given time $t$ to the maximal cliques of the link stream.
We prove its validity and compute its complexity, which is better than the
state-of-the art ones in many cases of interest. We also study the
output-sensitive complexity, which is close to the output size, thereby showing
that our algorithm is efficient. To confirm this, we perform experiments on
link streams used in the state of the art, and on massive link streams, up to
100 million links. In all cases our algorithm is faster, mostly by a factor of
at least 10 and up to a factor of $10^4$. Moreover, it scales to massive link
streams for which the existing algorithms are not able to provide the solution.

object detection and vehicle localization. Thereby, efficient processing of 3D
point clouds is crucial in these systems. In this work we propose K-D Bonsai, a
technique to cut down memory usage during radius search, a critical building
block of point cloud processing. K-D Bonsai exploits value similarity in the
data structure that holds the point cloud (a k-d tree) to compress the data in
memory. K-D Bonsai further compresses the data using a reduced floating-point
representation, exploiting the physically limited range of point cloud values.
For easy integration into nowadays systems, we implement K-D Bonsai through
Bonsai-extensions, a small set of new CPU instructions to compress, decompress,
and operate on points. To maintain baseline safety levels, we carefully craft
the Bonsai-extensions to detect precision loss due to compression, allowing
re-computation in full precision to take place if necessary. Therefore, K-D
Bonsai reduces data movement, improving performance and energy efficiency,
while guaranteeing baseline accuracy and programmability. We evaluate K-D
Bonsai over the euclidean cluster task of Autoware.ai, a state-of-the-art
software stack for AD. We achieve an average of 9.26% improvement in end-to-end

consumption. Differently from expensive accelerators proposed in related work,
K-D Bonsai improves radius search with minimal area increase (0.36%).

marginalizes the whole network once, using e.g. variable elimination, and then
backpropagates this operation to obtain the gradient with respect to all input

the efficiency of our algorithm by scaling it to massive networks with up to

alone will not be able to handle the classification of current and upcoming
surveys. To alleviate this issue, citizen science projects have been coupled
with machine learning techniques in pursuit of a more robust automated

an innovative learning methodology for citizen science capable of taking

designed to support adaptation in complex and highly time-varying environments,
these models can be employed by connected vehicles to enable their operation
within a dynamically changing network topology and support their selection of
optimal channels possessing low levels of congestion to achieve high
throughput. As a result, the proposed VDSA-based optimal channel selection
employs fundamental concepts from the bumblebee foraging model. In the proposed
approach, the Channel Busy Ratio (CBR) of all channels is computed and stored
in memory to be accessed by the MEB algorithm to make the necessary channel
switching decisions. Two averaging techniques, Sliding Window Average (SWA) and
Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), are employed to leverage past
samples and are evaluated against the no-memory case. Due to the high
variability of the environment (e.g., high velocities, changing density of
vehicles on the road), we propose to calculate the CBR by employing non-uniform
channel sampling allocations as well as evaluate it using both simplified
numerical and realistic Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) computer simulations. The
numerical simulation results show that gains in the probability of the best
channel selection can be achieved relative to a uniform sampling allocation
approach. By utilizing memory, we observe an additional increase in the channel
selection performance. Similarly, we see an increase in the probability of
successful reception when utilizing the bumblebee algorithm via a system-level

causal effects when treated and non-treated population differ too much. More
elaborate risks build proxies of the causal error using ``nuisance''
re-weighting to compute it on the observed data. But does computing these
nuisance adds noise to model selection? Drawing from an extensive empirical

light is a complex quantum mechanical process. Their study plays an important
role in the design of novel materials. A common yet challenging task in the
study is to determine the nature of electronic transitions, namely which
subgroups of the molecule are involved in the transition by donating or
accepting electrons, followed by an investigation of the variation in the
donor-acceptor behavior for different transitions or conformations of the
molecules. In this paper, we present a novel approach for the analysis of a
bivariate field and show its applicability to the study of electronic
transitions. This approach is based on two novel operators, the continuous
scatterplot (CSP) lens operator and the CSP peel operator, that enable
effective visual analysis of bivariate fields. Both operators can be applied
independently or together to facilitate analysis. The operators motivate the
design of control polygon inputs to extract fiber surfaces of interest in the
spatial domain. The CSPs are annotated with a quantitative measure to further
support the visual analysis. We study different molecular systems and
demonstrate how the CSP peel and CSP lens operators help identify and study
donor and acceptor characteristics in molecular systems.

mostly focuses on identifying individual bots, it remains underexplored how to
estimate the proportion of bots within specific communities and social

day-to-day users. In this work, we propose community-level bot detection, a
novel approach to estimating the amount of malicious interference in online
communities by estimating the percentage of bot accounts. Specifically, we
introduce BotPercent, an amalgamation of Twitter bot-detection datasets and
feature-, text-, and graph-based models that overcome generalization issues in
existing individual-level models, resulting in a more accurate community-level
bot estimation. Experiments demonstrate that BotPercent achieves
state-of-the-art community-level bot detection performance on the TwiBot-22
benchmark while showing great robustness towards the tampering of specific user
features. Armed with BotPercent, we analyze bot rates in different Twitter
groups and communities, such as all active Twitter users, users that interact
with partisan news media, users that participate in Elon Musk's content
moderation votes, and the political communities in different countries and
regions. Our experimental results demonstrate that the existence of Twitter
bots is not homogeneous, but rather a spatial-temporal distribution whose
heterogeneity should be taken into account for content moderation, social media
policy making, and more. The BotPercent implementation is available at

parameter $\varepsilon \in (0, 1]$. We begin with the low-regularity integrator
for the quadratic NLSE in which the integral is computed exactly and the
improved uniform first-order convergence in $H^r$ is proven at $O(\varepsilon
\tau)$ for solutions in $H^r$ with $r > 1/2$ up to the time $T_{\varepsilon } =
T/\varepsilon $ with fixed $T > 0$. Then, the improved uniform long-time error

and symmetric second-order low-regularity integrators which treat the zeroth

$T_{\varepsilon } = T/\varepsilon ^2$. With the help of the regularity
compensation oscillation (RCO) technique, the improved uniform error bounds are
established for the new non-resonant low-regularity schemes, which further
reduce the long-time error by a factor of $\varepsilon^2$ compared with
classical low-regularity integrators for the cubic NLSE. Numerical examples are
presented to validate the error estimates and compare with the classical

32,000) spectra of 877 solar twin and analogue candidates (547 at 1-4 kpc)
observed with the HERMES spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. These
are consistent with expectations for Teff and log g from photometry, and for
[Fe/H] from the Besancon stellar population model. EPIC provides small enough
uncertainties (~90 K, 0.08 dex, 0.05 dex, respectively), even at the low
signal-to-noise ratios available (S/N >~ 25 per pixel), to identify 299 new
solar analogues (> 90% confidence), and 20 solar twins (>50% confidence), 206
and 12 of which are at 1-4 kpc. By extending EPIC to measure line broadening
and lithium abundance from HERMES spectra, and with ages derived from isochrone
fitting with our stellar parameters, we identify 174 solar analogues at 1-4 kpc
which are relatively inactive, slowly rotating, and with no evidence of
spectroscopic binarity. These are the preferred targets for follow-up
spectroscopy to measure alpha.

Given that the process to obtain a lemma from an inflected word can be
explained by looking at its morphosyntactic category, including fine-grained
morphosyntactic information to train contextual lemmatizers has become common
practice, without analyzing whether that is the optimum in terms of downstream

morphological information to develop contextual lemmatizers in six languages

agglutinative languages; (ii) in fact, modern contextual word representations
seem to implicitly encode enough morphological information to obtain good
contextual lemmatizers without seeing any explicit morphological signal; (iii)
the best lemmatizers out-of-domain are those using simple UPOS tags or those
trained without morphology; (iv) current evaluation practices for lemmatization
are not adequate to clearly discriminate between models.

jamming power, or both. To raise concerns about the potential threats posed by
illegitimate intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), we propose an alternative
method to launch jamming attacks on LUs without either LU channel state
information (CSI) or jamming power. The proposed approach employs an
adversarial IRS with random phase shifts, referred to as a ""disco"" IRS (DIRS),
that acts like a ""disco ball"" to actively age the LUs' channels. Such active
channel aging (ACA) interference can be used to launch jamming attacks on
multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. The proposed
DIRS-based fully-passive jammer (FPJ) can jam LUs with no additional jamming
power or knowledge of the LU CSI, and it can not be mitigated by classical
anti-jamming approaches. A theoretical analysis of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ
that provides an evaluation of the DIRS-based jamming attacks is derived. Based
on this detailed theoretical analysis, some unique properties of the proposed
DIRS-based FPJ can be obtained. Furthermore, a design example of the proposed
DIRS-based FPJ based on one-bit quantization of the IRS phases is demonstrated
to be sufficient for implementing the jamming attack. In addition, numerical
results are provided to show the effectiveness of the derived theoretical
analysis and the jamming impact of the proposed DIRS-based FPJ.

using Jovian planets around a sample of nearby low-mass stars as proxies. Using
state-of-the-art orbit fitting tools, we gauge the potential of Gaia astrometry
to predict the time of transit centre $T_c$ for the purpose of follow-up
observations to verify that the companions are indeed transiting. Typical
uncertainties on $T_c$ will be on the order of a few months, reduced to several
weeks for high astrometric signal-to-noise ratios and periods shorter than

that combined orbital fits would allow to significantly reduce the transit

straightforward as it often requires the intervention of human experts or the
use of expensive testing equipment. In these circumstances, active learning can
be highly beneficial in suggesting the most informative data points to be used
when fitting a model. Reducing the number of observations needed for model
development alleviates both the computational burden required for training and
the operational expenses related to labeling. Online active learning, in
particular, is useful in high-volume production processes where the decision
about the acquisition of the label for a data point needs to be taken within an
extremely short time frame. However, despite the recent efforts to develop
online active learning strategies, the behavior of these methods in the
presence of outliers has not been thoroughly examined. In this work, we
investigate the performance of online active linear regression in contaminated
data streams. Our study shows that the currently available query strategies are
prone to sample outliers, whose inclusion in the training set eventually
degrades the predictive performance of the models. To address this issue, we
propose a solution that bounds the search area of a conditional D-optimal
algorithm and uses a robust estimator. Our approach strikes a balance between
exploring unseen regions of the input space and protecting against outliers.
Through numerical simulations, we show that the proposed method is effective in
improving the performance of online active learning in the presence of
outliers, thus expanding the potential applications of this powerful tool.

layers: a higher-level controller for general lane change decision control and
a lower-level controller for safe kinematics control. Different from
traditional kinematics controllers, this lower-level controller conducts not
only longitudinal safety-critical control but also critically ensures safety
for lateral control during the platooning lane change. To effectively design
this lower-level controller, an optimization problem is solved with constraints

propagation are poorly understood. Utilizing climate networks to characterize
how active phases propagate within the SASM domain and using clustering

eastward-blocked, and stationary. We further show that Pacific sea surface

Three kinds of shape functions are considered: in addition to the

continuous, as well as numerical implementations of $n$-th order
($\mathcal{C}^{n}$ continuous) HIPs that are expressed in terms of an
underlying high-order LIP basis. Furnished with the new implementation, we
demonstrate that the first-order HIPs are reliable even with large numbers of
nodes and that they also work with non-uniform element grids, affording even
better results in atomic electronic structure calculations than LIPs with the
same total number of basis functions. We demonstrate that discontinuities can
be observed in the spin-$\sigma$ local kinetic energy $\tau_{\sigma}$ in small
LIP basis sets, while HIP basis sets do not suffer from such issues; however,
either set can be used to reach the complete basis set limit with smooth
$\tau_{\sigma}$. Moreover, we discuss the implications of HIPs on calculations
with meta-GGA functionals with a number of recent meta-GGA functionals, and
find most Minnesota functionals to be ill-behaved. We also examine the

techniques such as time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(TrARPES). While a tunable probe source with photon energy of 5.3 - 7.0 eV has
been recently implemented for TrARPES by using a KBe$_2$BO$_3$F$_2$ (KBBF)
device, the time resolution of 280 - 320 fs is still not ideal, which is mainly
limited by the duration of the VUV probe pulse generated by the KBBF device.
Here, by designing a new KBBF device which is specially optimized for fs
applications, an optimum pulse duration of 55 fs is obtained after systematic
diagnostics and optimization. More importantly, a high time resolution of 81 -
95 fs is achieved for TrARPES measurements covering the probe photon energy
range of 5.3 - 7.0 eV, making it particularly useful for investigating the
ultrafast dynamics of quantum materials. Our work extends the application of
KBBF device to ultrafast pump-probe techniques with the advantages of both
widely tunable VUV source and ultimate time resolution.

three filamentary structures (labelled W-f, SW-f, and SE-f) in the central

point to longitudinal gas flow along the filaments into the central region.
Filaments W-f, SW-f, and SE-f were calculated to have observed line masses of

HCN(3-2)/HCN(1-0), HCN(3-2)/HCO$^+$(3-2), HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1), and

outwards. We compare the HCN and HCO$^+$ observations with a grid of one-phase,
non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer models and
find them compatible with models that predict subthermally excited and
optically thick lines. We study the systematic variations of the line ratios
across the targets as a function of the stellar surface density
($\Sigma_\textrm{star}$), the intensity-weighted CO(2-1) ($\langle
I_\text{CO}\rangle$), and the star formation rate surface density
($\Sigma_\text{SFR}$). We find no apparent correlation with
$\Sigma_\text{SFR}$, but positive correlations with the other two parameters,
which are stronger in the case of $\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$. The
HCN/CO-$\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$ relations show $\lesssim$0.3 dex
galaxy-to-galaxy offsets, with HCN(3-2)/CO(2-1)-$\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$
being $\sim$2 times steeper than HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1). In contrast, the
HCN(3-2)/HCN(1-0)-$\langle I_\text{CO}\rangle$ relation exhibits a tighter
alignment between galaxies. We conclude that the overall behaviour of the line
ratios cannot be ascribed to variations in a single excitation parameter (e.g.
density or temperature).

caused by a standing linear kink fast magnetoacoustic wave is considered. The
slab is stretched along a straight magnetic field, and can represent, for
example, a current sheet in a flaring active region in corona of the Sun, or a
streamer or pseudostreamer stalk. The plasma density is non-uniform in the
perpendicular direction and described by a symmetric Epstein profile. The
plasma parameter $\beta$ is taken to be zero, which is a good approximation for
solar coronal active regions. The microwave emission is caused by mildly
relativistic electrons which occupy a layer within the oscillating slab and
radiate via the gyrosynchrotron (GS) mechanism. Light curves of the microwave
emission were simulated in the optically thin part of the GS spectrum, and
their typical Fourier spectra were analysed. It is shown that the microwave
response to a linear kink magnetohydrodynamic wave is non-linear. It is found
that, while the microwave light curves at the node oscillate with the same
frequency as the frequency of the perturbing kink mode, the frequency of the
microwave oscillations at the anti-node is two times higher than the kink
oscillation frequency. Gradual transformation the one type of the light curves
to another occurs when sliding from the node to the anti-node. This result does
not depend on the width of the GS-emitting layer inside the oscillating slab.
This finding should be considered in the interpretation of microwave
quasi-periodic pulsations in solar and stellar flares.

  Quality-Diversity in Uncertain Domains","Submitted to Transactions on Evolutionary Computation",,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Quality-Diversity optimisation (QD) has proven to yield promising results
across a broad set of applications. However, QD approaches struggle in the
presence of uncertainty in the environment, as it impacts their ability to
quantify the true performance and novelty of solutions. This problem has been
highlighted multiple times independently in previous literature. In this work,
we propose to uniformise the view on this problem through four main
contributions. First, we formalise a common framework for uncertain domains:
the Uncertain QD setting, a special case of QD in which fitness and descriptors
for each solution are no longer fixed values but distribution over possible
values. Second, we propose a new methodology to evaluate Uncertain QD
approaches, relying on a new per-generation sampling budget and a set of
existing and new metrics specifically designed for Uncertain QD. Third, we
propose three new Uncertain QD algorithms: Archive-sampling,
Parallel-Adaptive-sampling and Deep-Grid-sampling. We propose these approaches
taking into account recent advances in the QD community toward the use of
hardware acceleration that enable large numbers of parallel evaluations and
make sampling an affordable approach to uncertainty. Our final and fourth
contribution is to use this new framework and the associated comparison methods
to benchmark existing and novel approaches. We demonstrate once again the
limitation of MAP-Elites in uncertain domains and highlight the performance of
the existing Deep-Grid approach, and of our new algorithms. The goal of this
framework and methods is to become an instrumental benchmark for future works
considering Uncertain QD.

of a Jupiter mass planet orbiting a solar type primary. Tidal and rotational
frequencies are assumed comparable making the effect of rotation important.
Although centrifugal distortion is neglected, Coriolis forces are fully taken
into account. We focus in detail on the potentially resonant excitation of $r$
modes associated with spherical harmonics of degrees three and five. These are
mostly sited in the radiative core but with a significant response in the
convective envelope where dissipation occurs. Away from resonance significant
orbital evolution over the system lifetime is unlikely. However, tidal
interaction is enhanced near resonances and the orbital evolution accelerated
as they are passed through. This speed up may be sustained if near resonance
can be maintained. For close orbits with primaries rotating sufficiently
rapidly, this could arise from angular momentum loss and stellar spin down
through a stellar wind bringing about significant orbital evolution over the
system lifetime.

the limited extent to which the equivalent geometric representations of the
same crystal are considered. To address this challenge, we propose EMPNN a
periodic equivariant message-passing neural network that learns crystal lattice
deformation in an unsupervised fashion. Our model equivalently acts on lattice
according to the deformation action that must be performed, making it suitable
for crystal generation, relaxation and optimisation. We present experimental
evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

years due to the fundamental power-law distribution of objects in the
real-world. Most recent works in LTR use softmax classifiers that have a
tendency to correlate classifier norm with the amount of training data for a
given class. On the other hand, Prototype classifiers do not suffer from this
shortcoming and can deliver promising results simply using Nearest-Class-Mean
(NCM), a special case where prototypes are empirical centroids. However, the
potential of Prototype classifiers as an alternative to softmax in LTR is
relatively underexplored. In this work, we propose Prototype classifiers, which
jointly learn prototypes that minimize average cross-entropy loss based on
probability scores from distances to prototypes. We theoretically analyze the
properties of Euclidean distance based prototype classifiers that leads to
stable gradient-based optimization which is robust to outliers. We further
enhance Prototype classifiers by learning channel-dependent temperature
parameters to enable independent distance scales along each channel. Our
analysis shows that prototypes learned by Prototype classifiers are better
separated than empirical centroids. Results on four long-tailed recognition
benchmarks show that Prototype classifier outperforms or is comparable to the
state-of-the-art methods.

was controlled in real-time through visual electromyographic feedback. Five
healthy subjects (age: 27 +/- 5) were included in this study. The energetic

correlation between EMG and EoP, which was further altered by increasing the
frequency. The proposed energetic behavior is named the Geometric MyoPassivity

intriguing topic since the dawn of statistical mechanics. In this work, we
generalize the grand-isobaric ensemble to mixtures, and develop a Monte Carlo
algorithm for the rapid determination of entropy in these systems. A key
advantage of adiabatic ensembles is the direct connection they provide with
entropy. Here, we show how the entropy of a binary mixture A-B can be readily
obtained in the adiabatic grand-isobaric $(\mu_{\text{A}}$, $\mu_{\text{B}}, P,
R)$ ensemble, in which $\mu_{\text{A}}$ and $\mu_{\text{B}}$ denote the
chemical potential of components A and B, respectively, $P$ is the pressure,
and $R$ is the heat (Ray) function, that corresponds to the total energy of the
system. This, in turn, allows for the evaluation of the entropy of mixing, as
well as of the Gibbs free energy of mixing. We also demonstrate that our
approach performs very well both on systems modeled with simple potentials and
with complex many-body force fields. Finally, this approach provides a direct
route to the determination of the thermodynamic properties of mixing, and
allows for the efficient detection of departures from ideal behavior in
mixtures.

determine quarkonium dynamics in the quark gluon plasma. A particularly
important role is played by the ratio of the binding energy of species ($E_b$)
and the medium scales; temperature ($T$) and Debye mass ($m_D$). It is well
known that if these ratios are much larger than one then the dominant process
governing quarkonium evolution is dissociation by thermal gluons
(gluo-dissociation). On the other hand, if this ratio is much smaller than one
then quarkonium dynamics is dominated by screening and Landau damping of the
exchanged gluons. Here we show that over most of the evolution, the scale
hierarchies do not fall in either limit and one needs to use the full structure
of the gluonic spectral function to follow the dynamics of the $Q\bar{Q}$ pair.
This has a significant bearing when we follow the quantum dynamics of quarkonia
in the medium. The inverse medium relaxation time is also $\sim T$ and if $E_b$
is comparable (or larger) in magnitude to $T$, the quantum evolution of
$Q\bar{Q}$ is non-local in time within the Brownian approximation.

be interchanged with magnetic helicity while preserving the total chirality
through the quantum chiral anomaly. The decay of turbulent energy in plasmas
such as those in the early Universe and compact stars is usually controlled by
certain conservation laws. In the case of zero total chirality, when the
magnetic helicity density balances with the appropriately scaled chiral
chemical potential to zero, the total chirality no longer determines the decay.
We propose that in such a case, an adaptation to the Hosking integral, which is
conserved in nonhelical magnetically dominated turbulence, controls the decay
in turbulence with helicity balanced by chiral fermions. We show, using a high
resolution numerical simulation, that this is indeed the case. The magnetic
energy density decays and the correlation length increases with time just like
in nonhelical turbulence with vanishing chiral chemical potential. But here,
the magnetic helicity density is nearly maximum and shows a scaling with time
$t$ proportional to $t^{-2/3}$. This is unrelated to the $t^{-2/3}$ decay of
magnetic {\it energy} in fully helical magnetic turbulence. The modulus of the
chiral chemical potential decays in the same fashion. This is much slower than
the exponential decay previously expected in theories of asymmetric baryon
production from the hypermagnetic helicity decay after axion inflation.

learning (ML) architectures, modern on-device deep learning frameworks are
proficient in utilizing computing resources in mobile platforms seamlessly, in
terms of producing highly accurate results in less inference time. However, on
the flip side, energy resources in a mobile device are typically limited.
Hence, whenever a complex Deep Neural Network (DNN) architecture is fed into
the on-device deep learning framework, while it achieves high prediction
accuracy (and performance), it also urges huge energy demands during the
runtime. Therefore, managing these resources efficiently within the spectrum of
performance and energy efficiency is the newest challenge for any mobile

In this paper, first, we provide a timely review of recent advancements in
on-device deep learning while empirically evaluating the performance metrics of
current state-of-the-art ML architectures and conventional ML approaches with
the emphasis given on energy characteristics by deploying them on a smart

and depth, exploiting their inherent dependency in rigid SfM. The fundamental
idea presented is to benefit from per-pixel uncertainty in the optical flow

signal from other background sources. The standard calibration procedures used
to tune the selection criteria for double-beta decay events use a $^{228}$Th
source, because it provides samples of signal-like events. These samples
exhibit energy spatial distributions with subtle different topologies compared
to neutrinoless double-beta decay events. In this work, we will characterize
these topological differences and, with the support of a $^{56}$Co source,
evaluate biases and precision of calibration techniques which use such event
samples. Our results will be particularly relevant for future experiments in
which a solid estimation of the efficiency is required.

the obscured and unobscured AGN by means of the calcium break Dn(4000) and the
Hdelta Balmer line. The host galaxy ages are examined in conjunction with other
properties such as the galaxy stellar mass, and star-formation rate as well as
the AGN Eddington ratio. Our sample consists of 50 unobscured or mildly
obscured (logN_H (cm-2) < 23) and 23 heavily obscured AGN (log N_H (cm-2) >23)
in the redshift range z=0.6-1. We take specific caution to create control
samples in order to match the exact luminosity and redshift distributions for
the obscured and unobscured AGN. The majority of unobscured AGN appear to live
in young galaxies in contrast to the obscured AGN which appear to live in
galaxies located between the young and old galaxy populations. This finding may
be in contrast to those evolutionary AGN unification models which postulate
that the AGN begin their life in a heavy obscuration phase. The host galaxies
of the obscured AGN have significantly lower levels of specific star-formation.
At the same time the obscured AGN have lower Eddington ratios indicating a link
between the star-formation and the black hole accretion. We find that the
distribution of the stellar masses of the host galaxies of obscured AGN is
skewed towards higher stellar masses in agreement with previous findings. Our
results on the relative age of obscured AGN are valid when we match our
obscured and unobscured AGN samples according to the stellar mass of their host
galaxies. All the above results become less conspicuous when a lower column
density (log N_H(cm-2)= 21.5 or 22) is used to separate the obscured and
unobscured AGN populations.

been focused on predicting their arrival time and magnetic structure. To make
predictions, methods have been developed to derive the true CME speed, size and
position, among others. Difficulties in determining input parameters for CME
forecasting arise from the lack of direct measurements of the coronal magnetic
fields and uncertainties in estimating the CME 3D geometric and kinematic
parameters. White-light coronagraph images are usually employed by a variety of
CME reconstruction techniques. We explore how subjectivity affects the 3D CME
parameters that are obtained from the GCS reconstruction technique. We have
designed two different synthetic scenarios where the ``true'' geometric
parameters are known in order to quantify such uncertainties for the first
time. We explore this as follows: 1) Using the ray-tracing option from the GCS
model software, and 2) Using 3D MHD simulation data from the MAS code. Our
experiment includes different viewing configurations using single and multiple
viewpoints. CME reconstructions using a single viewpoint had the largest errors
and error ranges for both synthetic GCS and simulated MHD white-light data.
Increasing the number of viewpoints to two, the errors decreased by about
4$^\circ$ in latitude, 22$^\circ$ in longitude, 14$^\circ$ in tilt, and
10$^\circ$ in half-angle, pointing towards a need for at least two viewpoints.
We found the following CME parameter error bars as a starting point for
quantifying the minimum error in CME parameters from white-light
reconstructions: $\Delta\theta$ (latitude)=${6^\circ}$, $\Delta\phi$
(longitude)=${11^\circ}$, $\Delta\gamma$ (tilt)=${25^\circ}$, $\Delta\alpha$

tabletop systems where generalized commutation relations are naturally
realized. Such generalized algebras of quantization, which lead to generalized
versions of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, are under intense scrutiny
these days, as they could manifest a fundamental length scale of spacetime.
Despite the efforts and the many intriguing results, there are no experimental
signatures of any generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). Therefore, our
results here, which tell how to use tabletop physical systems to test certain
GUPs in analog experiments, should be of interest to practitioners of quantum
gravity. We identify three different energy regimes that we call ``layers'',
where the physics is still of a Dirac type but within precisely described
limits. The higher the energy, the more sensitive the Dirac system becomes to
the effects of the lattice. Here such lattice plays the role of a discrete
space where the Dirac quasi-particles live. With the goals just illustrated, we
had to identify the mapping between the high-energy coordinates, $X^i$, and the
low-energy ones, $x^i$, i.e., those measured in the lab. We then obtained three
generalized Heisenberg algebras. For two of them we have the noticeable result
that $X^i = x^i$, and for the third one we obtained an improvement with respect
to an earlier work: the generalized coordinates expressed in terms of the
standard phase space variables, $X^i(x,p)$, and higher order terms.

a diameter of fewer than 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) is using aerosol optical depth
(AOD) products. Different AOD products are retrieved from various satellite
sensors, like MODIS and VIIRS, by various algorithms, such as Deep Blue and
Dark Target. Therefore, they do not have the same accuracy and spatial
resolution. Additionally, the weakness of algorithms in AOD retrieval reduces
the spatial coverage of products, particularly in cloudy or snowy areas.
Consequently, for the first time, the present study investigated the
possibility of fusing AOD products from observations of MODIS and VIIRS sensors
retrieved by Deep Blue and Dark Target algorithms to estimate PM2.5 more
accurately. For this purpose, AOD products were fused by machine learning
algorithms using different fusion strategies at two levels: the data level and
the decision level. First, the performance of various machine learning
algorithms for estimating PM2.5 using AOD data was evaluated. After that, the
XGBoost algorithm was selected as the base model for the proposed fusion
strategies. Then, AOD products were fused. The fusion results showed that the
estimated PM2.5 accuracy at the data level in all three metrics, RMSE, MAE, and
R2, was improved (R2=0.64). Despite the simplicity and lower computational cost
of the data level fusion method, the spatial coverage did not improve
considerably due to eliminating poor quality data through the fusion process.
Afterward, the fusion of products at the decision level was followed in eleven
scenarios. In this way, the best result was obtained by fusing Deep Blue
products of MODIS and VIIRS sensors (R2=0.81)

This work presents CertViT, a two-step proximal-projection method to achieve

become increasingly common that a collection of temporal data rapidly

valuable information through the estimation of increasingly precise models. But
at the same time it imposes the challenge of continuously updating the models
as new data become available.
  Currently available methods for addressing this problem, the so-called online
learning methods, use current parameter estimations and novel data to update
the estimators. These approaches avoid using the full raw data and speeding up
the computations.
  In this work we consider three online learning algorithms for parameters
estimation in the context of time series models. In particular, the methods
implemented are: gradient descent, Newton-step and Kalman filter recursions.
These algorithms are applied to the recently developed irregularly observed
autoregressive (iAR) model. The estimation accuracy of the proposed methods is
assessed by means of Monte Carlo experiments.
  The results obtained show that the proposed online estimation methods allow
for a precise estimation of the parameters that generate the data both for the
regularly and irregularly observed time series. These online approaches are
numerically efficient, allowing substantial computational time savings.
Moreover, we show that the proposed methods are able to adapt the parameter
estimates quickly when the time series behavior changes, unlike batch
estimation methods.

changes due to its high contrast for soft tissues and high spatial resolution.
It has been widely used in diagnosing neurological brain diseases, such as
Alzheimer disease (AD). However, the size of 3D high-resolution data poses a
significant challenge for data analysis and processing. Since only a few areas
of the brain show structural changes highly associated with AD, the patch-based
methods dividing the whole image data into several small regular patches have
shown promising for more efficient sMRI-based image analysis. The major
challenges of the patch-based methods on sMRI include identifying the
discriminative patches, combining features from the discrete discriminative
patches, and designing appropriate classifiers. This work proposes a novel
patch-based deep learning network (sMRI-PatchNet) with explainable patch
localisation and selection for AD diagnosis using sMRI. Specifically, it
consists of two primary components: 1) A fast and efficient explainable patch
selection mechanism for determining the most discriminative patches based on
computing the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) contribution to a transfer
learning model for AD diagnosis on massive medical data; and 2) A novel
patch-based network for extracting deep features and AD classfication from the
selected patches with position embeddings to retain position information,
capable of capturing the global and local information of inter- and
intra-patches. This method has been applied for the AD classification and the
prediction of the transitional state moderate cognitive impairment (MCI)
conversion with real datasets.

fault tolerant qubits in quantum computation[1-3]. Early experimental
achievements study hybrid systems[4-5] as well as doped intrinsic topological

inconclusive phenomenology or very-low temperatures. In a very recent work
intrinsic two-dimensional low-temperature superconductivity has been reported
in the type-I Weyl semimetal trigonal PtBi2[9]. However, larger critical
temperatures are indispensable for technological exploitation. Here we show
that trigonal PtBi2 possesses high-temperature surface superconductivity. By
means of scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we reveal that the superconducting
gap can be as large as 20 meV, suggesting a critical temperature in the 100 K
range, like in cuprate high-temperature superconductors. To our knowledge, this
is the largest superconducting gap that has been observed so far in a
topological material. The superconducting state at 5 K persists up to
Tesla-range applied fields and the upper critical field at this temperature is
of roughly 12 Tesla. Our results therefore render trigonal PtBi2 a prime
candidate for topological superconductivity at technologically relevant
temperatures.

synaptic couplings that fluctuate, in turn, about quenched random strengths in
response to pre- and postsynaptic neuronal activity. Using dynamical mean-field
theory, we compute the phase diagram of the combined neuronal-synaptic system,
revealing several novel phases suggestive of computational function. In the
regime in which the non-plastic system is chaotic, Hebbian plasticity slows
chaos, while anti-Hebbian plasticity quickens chaos and generates an
oscillatory component in neuronal activity. Deriving the spectrum of the joint
neuronal-synaptic Jacobian reveals that these behaviors manifest as
differential effects of eigenvalue repulsion. In the regime in which the
non-plastic system is quiescent, Hebbian plasticity can induce chaos. In both
regimes, sufficiently strong Hebbian plasticity creates exponentially many
stable neuronal-synaptic fixed points that coexist with chaotic states.
Finally, in chaotic states with sufficiently strong Hebbian plasticity, halting
synaptic dynamics leaves a stable fixed point of neuronal dynamics, freezing
the neuronal state. This phase of freezable chaos provides a novel mechanism of

practically all supply chains. This restructuring process might cause
considerable social distress, e.g. in the form of unemployment, if companies
have to close down. Here, we use a unique dataset of the entire firm-level
production network of a European economy and develop a network-theory-based
measure to estimate the systemic social relevance of every single firm. It
enables us to estimate the expected direct and indirect job losses in the
supply chain triggered by every firm's default. For the largest CO2 emitting
firms we link this measure of social relevance to their emissions. We identify
firms with low social relevance and high emissions as potential decarbonization
leverage points. We compare various decarbonization strategies by
simultaneously capturing the social and environmental impact under the
assumption that specific sets of firms would no longer produce. We find that a
strategy based on the identified decarbonization leverage points could lead to
a 20% reduction of CO2 emissions while putting 2% of jobs at risk. In contrast,
targeting the largest emitters first, without considering their social
relevance, results in 33% of jobs being at risk for comparable emission
savings. Our results indicate that supply-chain sensitive CO2 taxation might

LixCoO2 (LCO) as a model system to benchmark a machine learning-enabled

assemblies of thousands of atoms described by density functional
theory-informed statistical mechanics, and (b) continuum phase field models to
study the dynamics of order-disorder transitions in LCO. Central to the scale
bridging is the rigorous, quantitatively accurate, representation of the free
energy density and chemical potentials of this material system by
coarsegraining formation energies for specific atomic configurations. We
develop active learning workflows to train recently developed integrable deep

operations (e.g., payments and accessing buildings). Attacking smart cards can
have severe consequences, such as losing money or leaking sensitive
information. Although the security protections embedded in smart cards have
evolved over the years, those with weak security properties are still commonly
used. Among the different solutions, blocking cards are affordable devices to
protect smart cards. These devices are placed close to the smart cards,
generating a noisy jamming signal or shielding them. Whereas vendors claim the
reliability of their blocking cards, no previous study has ever focused on
evaluating their effectiveness. In this paper, we shed light on the security
threats on smart cards even in the presence of blocking cards, showing the
possibility of being bypassed by an attacker. We analyze blocking cards by
inspecting their emitted signal and assessing a vulnerability in their internal
design. We propose a novel attack that bypasses the jamming signal emitted by a
blocking card and reads the content of the smart card. We evaluate the
effectiveness of 14 blocking cards when protecting a MIFARE Ultralight smart
card and a MIFARE Classic card. We demonstrate that the protection of the 8
blocking cards among the 14 we evaluate can be successfully bypassed to dump
the content of the smart card. Based on this observation, we propose a
countermeasure that may lead to the design of effective blocking cards. To
assist further security improvement, the tool that we developed to inspect the
spectrum emitted by blocking cards and set up our attack is made available in
open source.

solution to virtualization in such low-resource and constrained systems towards
resilient distributed sensor and cyber-physical networks using a unified

independent of the angle between the probing light polarization and the
orientation of terraces. Based on a detailed analysis of the plasmon absorption
lineshape and its behavior in the magnetic field, supported by confocal Raman
mapping and atomic force microscopy, we explain this discrepancy by
spontaneously formed graphene micro flakes. We further support our conclusions
using data collected on artificially created graphene nanoribbons: we recognize
similar plasmon origin in artificial ribbons and naturally formed grains. An
unexpectedly large plasmon resonance redshift was observed in nanoribbons. In a
hydrogen-intercalated sample (which does not contain the buffer), this redshift
is quantitatively taken into account by a plasmon-plasmon interaction. In
non-intercalated samples featuring a buffer layer, this redshift is due to an
interplay between the plasmon-plasmon coupling and Coulomb screening by the
buffer-induced interface states. This model determines the density of interface

representation learning for skeleton-based action recognition. Existing methods
mainly focus on applying global data augmentation to generate different views
of the skeleton sequence for contrastive learning. However, due to the rich
action clues in the skeleton sequences, existing methods may only take a global
perspective to learn to discriminate different skeletons without thoroughly
leveraging the local relationship between different skeleton joints and video
frames, which is essential for real-world applications. In this work, we
propose a Partial Spatio-Temporal Learning (PSTL) framework to exploit the
local relationship from a partial skeleton sequences built by a unique
spatio-temporal masking strategy. Specifically, we construct a
negative-sample-free triplet steam structure that is composed of an anchor
stream without any masking, a spatial masking stream with Central Spatial
Masking (CSM), and a temporal masking stream with Motion Attention Temporal
Masking (MATM). The feature cross-correlation matrix is measured between the
anchor stream and the other two masking streams, respectively. (1) Central
Spatial Masking discards selected joints from the feature calculation process,
where the joints with a higher degree of centrality have a higher possibility
of being selected. (2) Motion Attention Temporal Masking leverages the motion
of action and remove frames that move faster with a higher possibility. Our
method achieves SOTA performance on NTU-60, NTU-120 and PKU-MMD under various
downstream tasks. A practical evaluation is performed where some skeleton
joints are lost in downstream tasks. In contrast to previous methods that
suffer from large performance drops, our PSTL can still achieve remarkable
results, validating the robustness of our method. Code:

resolve the ``Hubble tension'', the discrepancy between ``direct'' measurements
of the current expansion rate of the Universe and ``indirect measurements'' for
which the values inferred rely on the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model
calibrated on early-universe data. EDE refers to a new form of dark energy
active at early times (typically a scalar-field), that quickly dilutes away at
a redshift close to matter-radiation equality. The role of EDE is to decrease
the sound horizon by briefly contributing to the Hubble rate in the
pre-recombination era. We summarize the results of several analyses of EDE
models suggested thus far in light of recent cosmological data, including
constraints from the canonical {\it Planck} data, baryonic acoustic
oscillations and Type Ia supernovae, and the more recent hints driven by cosmic
microwave background observations using the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We
also discuss potential challenges to EDE models, from theoretical ones (a
second ``cosmic coincidence'' problem in particular) to observational ones,
related to the amplitude of clustering on scales of $8h$/Mpc as measured by
weak-lensing observables (the so-called $S_8$ tension) and the galaxy power
spectrum from BOSS analyzed through the effective field theory of large-scale
structure. We end by reviewing recent attempts at addressing these shortcomings
of the EDE proposal. While current data remain inconclusive on the existence of
an EDE phase, we stress that given the signatures of EDE models imprinted in
the CMB and matter power spectra, next-generation experiments can firmly
establish whether EDE is the mechanism responsible for the Hubble tension and
distinguish between the various models suggested in the literature.

during nonlinear structure formation in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Fully nonlinear
initial conditions are set at an initial redshift $z\approx 300$, based
directly on the gauge invariant comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}_c$
commonly used to model early-universe fluctuations. Assigning a simple 3-D
sinusoidal structure to $\mathcal{R}_c$, we then have a lattice of
quasi-spherical over-densities representing idealised dark matter halos
connected through filaments and surrounded by voids. This structure is
implemented in the synchronous-comoving gauge, using a pressureless perfect
fluid (dust) description of CDM, and then it is fully evolved with the Einstein
Toolkit code. With this, we look into whether the Top-Hat spherical and
homogeneous collapse model provides a good description of the collapse of
over-densities. We find that the Top-Hat is an excellent approximation for the
evolution of peaks, where we observe that the shear is negligible and collapse
takes place when the linear density contrast reaches the predicted critical
value $\delta^{(1)}_C =1.69$. Additionally, we characterise the outward
expansion of the turn-around boundary and show how it depends on the initial
distribution of matter, finding that it is faster in denser directions,
incorporating more and more matter in the infalling region. Using the EBWeyl
code [1] we look at the distribution of the electric and magnetic parts of the
Weyl tensor, finding that they are stronger along and around the filaments,
respectively. We introduce a method to dynamically classify different regions
in Petrov types. With this, we find that the spacetime is of Petrov type I
everywhere, as expected, but we can identify the leading order type, finding a
transition between different types as non-linearity grows, with production of
gravitational waves.

u is the control vector, robotic systems are typically governed by second order
ODEs of the form $\ddot{q} = g(q, \dot{q}, u, t)$, where q is the
configuration. To convert the second order ODE into a first order one, the
usual approach is to introduce a velocity variable v and impose its coincidence
with the time derivative of q. Lobatto methods grant this constraint by
construction, as their polynomials describing the trajectory for v are the time
derivatives of those for q, but the same cannot be said for the Gauss and Radau
methods. This is problematic for such methods, as then they cannot guarantee
that $\ddot{q} = g(q, \dot{q}, u, t)$ at the collocation points. On their
negative side, Lobatto methods cannot be used to solve initial value problems,
as given the values of u at the collocation points they generate an
overconstrained system of equations for the states. In this paper, we propose a
Legendre-Gauss collocation method that retains the advantages of the usual
Lobatto, Gauss, and Radau methods, while avoiding their shortcomings. The
collocation scheme we propose is applicable to solve initial value problems,
preserves the consistency between the polynomials for v and q, and ensures that

Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz $F(\bar{R})$ theories with a flat FLRW metric is studied.
We first study the standard $f(R)$ theories and show that the only way in which
the dS conjecture can be made independent of $R$ is by considering a power law
of the form $f(R)\sim R^{\gamma}$. The conjecture and the consistency of the
theory puts restrictions on $\gamma$ to be greater but close to $1$. For the
$F(\bar{R})$ theories described by its two parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu$ we
use the equations of motion to construct the function starting with an ansatz
for the scale factor in the Jordan frame of the power law form. By doing a
conformal transformation on the three metric to the Einstein frame we can
obtain an action of gravity plus a scalar filed by relating the parameters of
the theory. The non-projectable and projectable cases are studied and the
differences are outlined. The $F(\bar{R})$ function obtained consists of terms
of the form $\bar{R}^{\gamma}$ with the possibility of having negative power
terms. The dS conjecture leads to inequalities for the $\lambda$ parameter, in
both versions it gets restricted to be greater but close to $1/3$. For the
general case in which $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are considered as independent, the
action contains an extra term but we propose that the conjecture is still
applicable. Once again the non-projectable and projectable cases are studied.
The $F$ function obtained has the same form as before, the consistency of the
theory and the dS conjecture lead to a set of inequalities on both parameters
that are studied numerically. In all cases $\lambda$ is restricted by $\mu$
around $1/3$ and we obtain $\lambda\to1/3$ if $\mu\to0$. Finally we consider
the $f(R)$ limit $\mu,\lambda\to1$ and we obtain consistent results.

quality reliably and privately is therefore of high importance. To this end, we

it privately computes and compares a Fr\'echet distance between embeddings
generated by a large language model on both the central (public) dataset and
the federated private client data. To make this computation privacy-preserving,
we use distributed, differentially-private mean and covariance estimators. We
show empirically that FreD accurately predicts the best prefinetuning dataset

proof-of-concept for a new approach in private FL training: (1) customize a
prefinetuning dataset to better match user data (2) prefinetune (3) perform
FL-finetuning.

Affine $I_2(h)$ is constructed as the subgroup of the affine $B_n$, the
symmetry of the cubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$. The infinite discrete group with
local dihedral symmetry of order $2h$ operates on the concentric h-gons
obtained by projecting the Voronoi cell of the cubic lattice with $2^n$
vertices onto the Coxeter plane. Voronoi cells tile the space facet to facet,
consequently, leading to the tilings of the Coxeter plane with some overlaps of
the rhombic tiles. It is noted that the projected Voronoi cell is the overlap
of $h$ copy of the $h$-gons tiled with some rhombi and rotated by the angle
$2\pi/h$. After a general discussion on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with the
affine symmetry $\tilde B_n$ and its affine dihedral subgroup $\tilde I_2(h)$
its projection onto the Coxeter plane has been worked out with some examples.
The cubic lattices with affine symmetry $\tilde B_n$ $(n=1,2,3,4,5)$ have been
presented and shown that the projection of the lattice $B_3$ leads to the
hexagonal lattice, the projection of the lattice $B_4$ describes the
Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal lattice with 8-fold local symmetry and the
projection of the lattice $B_5$ describes a quasicrystal structure with local

show that the projections of the cubic lattices with even higher dimensions

assume that the system dynamics is given by a first order ODE, whereas robots

the usual practice is to resort to the well known procedure of casting an M th

discretized. Since the configuration variables and their time derivatives are
approximated with polynomials of the same degree, their differential
dependencies cannot be fulfilled, and the actual dynamics is not satisfied, not
even at the collocation points. This paper draws attention to this problem, and
develops improved versions of the trapezoidal and Hermite-Simpson collocation

give an essentially tight answer to both questions for almost all norms on

  references",,,"DESY-23-019","gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two puzzles continue to plague our understanding of angular momentum balance
in the context of gravitational two-body scattering. First, because the
standard definition of the Bondi angular momentum $J$ is subject to a
supertranslation ambiguity, it has been shown that when the corresponding flux
$F_J$ is expanded in powers of Newton's constant $G$, it can start at either
$O(G^2)$ or $O(G^3)$ depending on the choice of frame. This naturally raises
the question as to whether the $O(G^2)$ part of the flux is physically
meaningful. The second puzzle concerns a set of new methods for computing the
flux that were recently developed using quantum field theory. Somewhat
surprisingly, it was found that they generally do not agree with the standard
formula for $F_J$, except in the binary's center-of-mass frame. In this paper,
we show that the resolution to both of these puzzles lies in the careful
interpretation of $J$: Generically, the Bondi angular momentum $J$ is
\emph{not} equal to the mechanical angular momentum $\mathcal{J}$ of the
binary, which is the actual quantity of interest. Rather, it is the sum of
$\mathcal{J}$ and an extra piece involving the shear of the gravitational
field. By separating these contributions, we obtain a new balance law, accurate
to all orders in $G$, that equates the total loss in mechanical angular
momentum $\Delta_\mathcal{J}$ to the sum of a radiative term, which always
starts at $O(G^3)$, and a static term, which always starts at $O(G^2)$. We show
that each of these terms is invariant under supertranslations, and we find that
$\Delta_\mathcal{J}$ matches the result from quantum field theory at least up
to $O(G^2)$ in all Bondi frames. The connection between our results and other
proposals for supertranslation-invariant definitions of the angular momentum is
also discussed.

parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ from the galaxy power spectrum. For two galaxy samples
$A$ and $B$, we show the constraining power is $\propto |b_1^B b_\phi^A - b_1^A
b_\phi^B|$, where $b_1$ and $b_\phi$ are the linear and PNG galaxy bias
parameters. This allows for significantly improved constraints compared to the
traditional expectation $\propto |b_1^A - b_1^B|$ based on naive
universality-like relations where $b_\phi \propto b_1$. Using IllustrisTNG
galaxy simulation data, we find that different equal galaxy number splits of
the full sample lead to different $|b_1^B b_\phi^A - b_1^A b_\phi^B|$, and thus
have different constraining power. Of all of the strategies explored, splitting
by $g-r$ color is the most promising, more than doubling the significance of
detecting $f_{\rm NL}b_\phi \neq 0$. Importantly, since these are constraints
on $f_{\rm NL}b_\phi$ and not $f_{\rm NL}$, they do not require priors on the
$b_\phi(b_1)$ relation. For direct constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, we show that
multi-tracer constraints can be significantly more robust than single-tracer to
$b_\phi$ misspecifications and uncertainties; this relaxes the precision and
accuracy requirements for $b_\phi$ priors. Our results present new
opportunities to improve our chances to detect and robustly constrain $f_{\rm
NL}$, and strongly motivate galaxy formation simulation campaigns to calibrate
the $b_\phi(b_1)$ relation.

differences between the state-of-the-art equations of state and their impact on
the properties of interior models. Accounting for uncertainty on the hydrogen
and helium equation of state, we assessed the span of the interior features of
Jupiter. We carried out an extensive exploration of the parameter space and
studied a wide range of interior models using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulations. To consider the uncertainty on the equation of state, we allowed
for modifications of the equation of state in our calculations. Our models
harbour a dilute core and indicate that Jupiter s internal entropy is higher
than what is usually assumed from the Galileo probe measurements. We obtain
solutions with extended dilute cores, but contrary to other recent interior
models of Jupiter, we also obtain models with small dilute cores. The dilute
cores in such solutions extend to 20% of Jupiter s mass, leading to better
agreement with formation evolution models. We conclude that the equations of
state used in Jupiter models have a crucial effect on the inferred structure

magnitude of the individual BH spins are all $\chi= 0.26$ and lie either along
the initial orbital plane or $45^\circ$ above it. We evolve these systems
throughout the inspiral, merger and postmerger phases to identify the impact of
the BH spins and the MR on any jet and their electromagnetic (EM) signatures.
We find that incipient jets are launched from both BHs regardless of the MR and
along the spin directions as long as the force-free parameter
$B^2/(8\,\pi\rho_0)$ in the funnel and above their poles is larger than one. At
large distances the two jets merge into a single one what may prevent the EM
detection of individual jets. As the accretion rate reaches a quasistationary
state during predecoupling, we observe a sudden amplification of the outgoing
Poynting luminosity that depends on the MR. Following merger, the sudden change
in the direction of the spin of the BH remnant with respect to the spins of its
progenitors causes a reorientation of the jet, which drives a single,
high-velocity, outward narrow beam collimated by a tightly wound, helical
Bfield which, in turn, boosts the Poynting luminosity. This effect is nearly MR
independent. During this process, a kink is produced in the Bfield lines,
confining the jet. The kink propagates along the jet but rapidly decays,
leaving no memory of the spin-shift. Our results suggest that the merger of
misaligned, low-spinning, BHBH mergers in low-mass disks may not provide a
viable scenario to explain X-shaped radio galaxies if other features are not
taken into account. However, the sudden changes in the outgoing luminosity at

predict group ages within 10-20% for associations younger than $\simeq$2.5 Gyr.
In practice, age uncertainties are larger, primarily due to finite group size.
The index is most useful at the youngest ages ($<$100 Myr), where the
uncertainties are comparable to or better than derived from a color-magnitude

clear evidence that the two transitions with Born-rule and forced measurements

for our numerical results by identifying the underlying statistical mechanics
model which follows from the general correspondence, established in Jian et
al., Phys. Rev. B 106, 134206, between non-unitary circuits of non-interacting
fermions and the ten-fold Altland-Zirnbauer (AZ) symmetry classes. The AZ class
is the same for Born-rule and forced measurements of the circuits. For the
circuit under consideration (in AZ class DIII), the statistical mechanics model
describing the transition is the principal chiral non-linear sigma model whose
field variable is an ${\rm SO}(n)$ matrix in the replica limits $n\to 0$ and
$n\to 1$ for forced and Born-rule measurements, respectively. The former is in
an Anderson localization universality class while we show that the latter is in
a novel universality class beyond Anderson localization. Both entanglement
transitions are driven by proliferation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological defects.
The different replica limits account for the difference in the universality
classes. Furthermore, we provide numerical and symmetry-based arguments that
the entanglement transition in the previously-studied monitored circuit of

mergers should be signposts for efficient minor merger-induced SMBH growth for
both the more and less massive progenitor. We identified two candidate dual
AGNs residing in apparent minor mergers with mass ratios of $\sim$1:7 and
$\sim$1:30. SDSS fiber spectra show broad and narrow emission lines in the
primary nuclei of each merger while only a narrow [O III] emission line and a

reveal rest-frame stellar absorption features, indicating the secondary sources
are foreground stars and that the previously detected broad lines are likely
the result of fiber spillover effects induced by the atmospheric seeing at the

phenomenon exhibited by nonlinear materials presenting temperature-dependent
thermal conductivity which, when sandwiched between two thermal baths with one

such as motile bacteria or self-propelled colloids. A canonical example is an
active Brownian particle (ABP) that moves at constant speed while its direction
of motion undergoes rotational diffusion. When ABPs are confined within a
channel, they tend to accumulate at the channel walls, even when inter-particle
interactions are ignored. Each particle pushes on the boundary until a tumble
event reverses its direction. The wall thus acts as a sticky boundary. In this
paper we consider a natural extension of sticky boundaries that allows for a
particle to be permanently killed (absorbed) whilst attached to a wall. In
particular, we investigate the first passage time (FPT) problem for an ABP in a
two-dimensional channel where one of the walls is partially absorbing.
Calculating the exact FPT statistics requires solving a non-trivial two-way
diffusion boundary value problem (BVP). We follow a different approach by
separating out the dynamics away from the absorbing wall from the dynamics of
absorption and escape whilst attached to the wall. Using probabilistic methods,
we derive an explicit expression for the MFPT of absorption, assuming that the
arrival statistics of particles at the wall are known. Our method also allows
us to incorporate a more general encounter-based model of absorption.

basin, rock physics definitions, well log and drilling data, and seismic
information. Monte Carlo basin modeling realizations are performed by sampling
from prior probability distributions on facies parameters and basin boundary
conditions. After data assimilation, the accepted set of posterior sub-surface
models yields uncertainty quantification of subsurface properties. This
procedure is especially suitable for pore pressure prediction in a predrill
stage. However, the high computational cost of seismic data assimilation
decreases the practicality of the workflow. Therefore, we introduce and
investigate seismic traveltimes criteria as computationally faster proxies for
analyzing the seismic data likelihood when employing BGBM. The proposed
surrogate schemes weigh the prior basin model results with the available
seismic data with no need to perform expensive seismic depth-migration
procedures for each Monte Carlo realization. Furthermore, we apply BGBM in a

  Prediction",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Anemia is common in patients post-ICU discharge. However, which patients will
develop or recover from anemia remains unclear. Prediction of anemia in this
population is complicated by hospital readmissions, which can have substantial
impacts on hemoglobin levels due to surgery, blood transfusions, or being a
proxy for severe illness. We therefore introduce a novel Bayesian joint
longitudinal model for hemoglobin over time, which includes specific parametric
effects for hospital admission and discharge. These effects themselves depend
on a patient's hemoglobin at time of hospitalization; therefore hemoglobin at a
given time is a function of that patient's complete history of admissions and
discharges up until that time. However, because the effects of an admission or
discharge do not depend on themselves, the model remains well defined. We
validate our model on a retrospective cohort of 6,876 patients from the
Rochester Epidemiology Project using cross-validation, and find it accurately
estimates hemoglobin and predicts anemic status and hospital readmission in the
30 days post-discharge with AUCs of .82 and .72, respectively.

Modular invariant partition functions are constructed and detailed examples of
both symmetric and asymmetric orbifolds are presented, including new examples
of five-dimensional non-supersymmetric string theories with no tachyons. The
orbifolds we consider arise at special points in the moduli space of string
theory compactifications with a duality twist. The supergravity limit of these
are Scherk-Schwarz reductions which generate gauged supergravities with
positive definite potentials on the moduli space in five dimensions. Both
symmetric and asymmetric freely acting orbifolds give a landscape of Minkowski
vacua. For gauged supergravities to belong to this landscape, we find a number
of constraints and conditions. Firstly, the scalar potential should lead to a
massive spectrum with masses that obey quantization conditions arising from a
string theory orbifold, which we discuss in detail. Secondly, we find
constraints on the massless sector, e.g. in the examples of orbifolds
preserving sixteen supercharges in five dimensions that we consider, only an
odd number of vector multiplets arise. Lastly, we present new examples of
candidate asymmetric orbifolds with modular invariant partition functions, but
with non-integral coefficients in the $q\bar{q}$-expansion in the twisted

automated testing of apps has become more important than ever. Android apps are
event-driven programs. Unfortunately, generating all possible types of events
by interacting with the app's interface is challenging for an automated testing
approach. Callback-driven testing eliminates the need for event generation by
directly invoking app callbacks. However, existing callback-driven testing
techniques assume prior knowledge of Android callbacks, and they rely on a
human expert, who is familiar with the Android API, to write stub code that
prepares callback arguments before invocation. Since the Android API is huge
and keeps evolving, prior techniques could only support a small fraction of
callbacks present in the Android framework.
  In this work, we introduce Columbus, a callback-driven testing technique that
employs two strategies to eliminate the need for human involvement: (i) it
automatically identifies callbacks by simultaneously analyzing both the Android
framework and the app under test, and (ii) it uses a combination of
under-constrained symbolic execution (primitive arguments), and type-guided
dynamic heap introspection (object arguments) to generate valid and effective
inputs. Lastly, Columbus integrates two novel feedback mechanisms -- data
dependency and crash-guidance, during testing to increase the likelihood of
triggering crashes, and maximizing coverage. In our evaluation, Columbus
outperforms state-of-the-art model-driven, checkpoint-based, and
callback-driven testing tools both in terms of crashes and coverage.

algebraic, tabular, numerical and map methods. The most prominent among these
classes are the algebraic and map methods. This paper surveys and compares
these two types of methods as regards simplicity, efficiency, and usability.
The paper identifies the main types of solutions of Boolean equations as
subsumptive general solutions, parametric general solutions and particular
solutions. In a subsumptive general solution, each of the variables is
expressed as an interval based on successive conjunctive or disjunctive
eliminants of the original function. In a parametric general solution each of
the variables is expressed via arbitrary parameters which are freely chosen
elements of the underlying Boolean algebra. A particular solution is an
assignment from the underlying Boolean algebra to every pertinent variable that
makes the Boolean equation an identity. The paper offers a tutorial exposition,
review, and comparison of the three types of solutions by way of an
illustrative example. This example is also viewed from the perspective of a
recently developed technique that relies on atomic decomposition. Map
techniques are demonstrated to be at least competitive with (and occasionally
superior to) algebraic techniques, since they have a better control on the
minimality of the pertinent function representations, and hence are more
capable of producing more compact solutions.

reusable public resources. We consider settings where a limited resource is
shared among a set of agents, each of whom may request to use the resource over
multiple consecutive rounds, receiving some utility only if they get to use the
resource for the full duration of their request. Such settings are of
particular significance in scientific research where large-scale instruments
such as electron microscopes, particle colliders, and telescopes are shared
between multiple research groups; this model also subsumes and extends existing
models of repeated non-monetary allocation where resources are required for a
single round only.
  We study a simple pseudo-market mechanism where upfront we endow each agent
with some budget of artificial credits, with the budget proportion reflecting
the fair share of the resource we want the agent to receive. The endowments
thus define for each agent her ideal utility as that which she derives from her
favorite allocation with no competition, but subject to getting at most her
fair share of the items across rounds. Next, on each round, and for each
available item, our mechanism runs a first-price auction with a selective
reserve, wherein each agent submits a desired duration and per-round-bid (which
must be at least the reserve price), and the highest bidder gets to use the
item for the desired duration. We consider this problem in a Bayesian setting
and show that under a carefully chosen reserve price, irrespective of how
others bid, each agent has a strategy that guarantees her a $1/2$ fraction of
her ideal utility in expectation. We also show this result is tight, i.e.,
there is no mechanism that can guarantee that all agents get more than half of

connected with many interesting phenomena. For instance, the extension of
Enrique's classification of surfaces to positive characteristic (Bombieri and

show that the smoothing process introduced by Shimada in 1991 can be used to
classify the set of fibrations by genus two singular curves, up to isomorphism
among their generic fibers, such that their smoothing are elliptic fibrations
on rational surfaces. Moreover we will also describe the vector fields that can
be used to recover such fibrations by singular curves via quotient of rational

cosmological simulations -- the impact of massive neutrinos should therefore be
included in these simulations in a realistic, computationally tractable, and
controlled manner. A recent proposal to reduce the related computational cost
employs a symmetric neutrino momentum sampling strategy in the initial
conditions. We implement a modified version of this strategy into the
Hardware/Hybrid Accelerated Cosmology Code (HACC) and perform convergence tests
on its internal parameters. We illustrate that this method can impart
$\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ numerical artifacts on the total matter field on small
scales, similar to previous findings, and present a method to remove these
artifacts using Fourier-space filtering of the neutrino density field.
Moreover, we show that the converged neutrino power spectrum does not follow
linear theory predictions on relatively large scales at early times at the
$15\%$ level, prompting a more careful study of systematics in particle-based
neutrino simulations. We also present an improved method for backscaling linear
transfer functions for initial conditions in massive neutrino cosmologies that
is based on achieving the same relative neutrino growth as computed with
Boltzmann solvers. Our self-consistent backscaling method yields sub-percent
accuracy in the total matter growth function. Comparisons for the non-linear

definitions of all of the quantities characterising these equilibria, starting
from the concept of the von Zeipel cylinders and up to the possible ranges of
the specific angular momenta that are employed to construct families of tori.
Within the allowed space of parameters we have then encountered both standard

While the properties of the first ones in terms of the presence of a single
cusp, of a local pressure maximum and of a varying outer radius, are very
similar to those encountered in general relativity, the properties of
double-tori solutions are far richer and naturally allow for configurations
having the same constant specific angular momentum and hence are potentially
easier to produce in nature. The existence of these objects is at present very
hypothetical, but these equilibrium tori were to be observed, they would
provide very valuable information on the properties of the spacetime and on its

  scattering: A Bayesian approach","22 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Single molecule X-ray scattering experiments with free electron lasers have
opened a new route to the structure determination of biomolecules. Because
typically only very few photons per scattering image are recorded and thus the
signal-to-noise ratio is very low in this extreme Poisson regime, structure
refinement is quite challenging. In addition, in each scattering event the
orientation of the biomolecule is random and unknown. As a further layer of
complexity, many biomolecules show structural heterogeneity and conformational
transitions between different distinct structures; these structural dynamics
are averaged out by existing refinement methods. To overcome these limitations,
here we developed and tested a rigorous Bayesian approach and demonstrate that
it should be possible to determine not only a single structure, but an entire
structural ensemble from these experiments. Using $10^6$ synthetic scattering
images generated from molecular dynamics trajectories, our approach was able to
resolve ensembles of eight alanine dipeptide conformers at $2\,$\r{A}
resolution; similarly, we determined the unfolded ensemble of the protein
chignolin at $4-7\,$\r{A} resolution using $1.2\cdot 10^7$ images.
Unexpectedly, much fewer images are required to determine an ensemble of $n$
structures of $m$ atoms each than a single structure of $n\times m$ atoms,
i.e., of the same total number of degrees of freedom. These findings show that
X-ray scattering experiments using state-of-the-art free electron lasers should
allow one to determine not only biomolecular structures, but whole structure
ensembles and, ultimately, 'molecular movies'.

the cluster level but outcomes are typically collected at the individual level.
When CRTs are employed in pragmatic settings, baseline population
characteristics may moderate treatment effects, leading to what is known as
heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Pre-specified, hypothesis-driven HTE
analyses in CRTs can enable an understanding of how interventions may impact
subpopulation outcomes. While closed-form sample size formulas have recently
been proposed, assuming known intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) for
both the covariate and outcome, guidance on optimal cluster randomized designs
to ensure maximum power with pre-specified HTE analyses has not yet been
developed. We derive new design formulas to determine the cluster size and
number of clusters to achieve the locally optimal design (LOD) that minimizes
variance for estimating the HTE parameter given a budget constraint. Given the
LODs are based on covariate and outcome-ICC values that are usually unknown, we
further develop the maximin design for assessing HTE, identifying the
combination of design resources that maximize the relative efficiency of the
HTE analysis in the worst case scenario. In addition, given the analysis of the
average treatment effect is often of primary interest, we also establish
optimal designs to accommodate multiple objectives by combining considerations
for studying both the average and heterogeneous treatment effects. We

implementing a digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of an interacting

the available gate depth by up to two times with no overhead apart from
additional initial cooling when no overlapping qubit is involved. This is
because using a set of extra modes as additional quantum degrees of freedom is
nearly equivalent to halving the trap heating rate, doubling the laser and

strongly coupled dusty plasma confined in a ring-shaped (quartic) potential
well with a central barrier, whose axis of symmetry is parallel to the

potential leads to a transition from a ring monolayer structure (rings of
different diameters nested within the same plane) to a cylindrical shell
structure (rings of similar diameter aligned in parallel planes). In the
cylindrical shell state, the rings alignment in the vertical plane exhibits
hexagonal symmetry. The ring transition is reversible, but exhibits hysteresis
in the initial and final particle positions. As the critical conditions for the
transitions are approached, the transitional structure states exhibit zigzag
instabilities or asymmetries on the ring alignment. Furthermore, for a fixed
amplitude of the quartic potential that results in a cylinder-shaped shell
structure, we show that additional rings in the cylindrical shell structure can
be formed by decreasing the curvature of the parabolic potential well, whose
axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the gravitational force, increasing the
number density, and lowering the screening parameter. Finally, we discuss the

parallel using domain decomposition strategies. The framework addresses state
of the art PDE-solvers dedicated to practical applications. Although the
approach is applied to technical flows, it is applicable in similar
applications under the umbrella of Computational Science and Engineering (CSE).
To this end, we introduce a bunch matrix that allows the aggregation of
multiple time steps and SVD updates, and significantly increases the
computational efficiency. The incremental SVD strategy is initially verified
and validated by simulating the 2D laminar single-phase flow around a circular
cylinder. Subsequent studies analyze the proposed strategy for a 2D submerged
hydrofoil located in turbulent two-phase flows. Attention is directed to the
accuracy of the SVD-based reconstruction based on local and global flow
quantities, their physical realizability, the independence of the domain
partitioning, and related implementation aspects. Moreover, the influence of
lower and (adaptive) upper construction rank thresholds on both the effort and
the accuracy are assessed. The incremental SVD process is applied to analyze

developers to carefully coordinate their changes, even when modifying

decisions frequently lead to the presence of large, change-prone source files
that are at the center of complexes of technical debt. This kind of technical
debt quickly incurs interest both through coordination costs and
error-proneness. In this paper, we present a new approach for decomposing these
``large-active'' files to pay down critical technical debt. We package our
approach as a refactoring recommendation system. Each recommendation is
determined by analyzing patterns of co-change and mutual dependency among
files. Each recommendation corresponds to a responsibility the large-active
file has in relation to the rest of the system. By moving recommended
functionality from the large-active file into smaller files, developers can
reduce the impact of a debt-laden file and clarify its essential
responsibilities. A key advantage of this approach over prior work is that we
better focus effort; we avoid spending developer effort refactoring code that
is only superficially problematic. We achieve this by incorporating revision
history into both determining and ranking recommendations. Each recommendation
corresponds to some change-prone responsibility. We present some examples of
this approach in action and outline our future plans.

Comprehensive results are presented for broad ranges of the relevant parameters

$V$) that safely cover values characterizing currently fabricated junctions.
They demonstrate that the strongest thermal effects occur at biases below
resonance ($2 \left\vert \varepsilon_0 \right\vert - \delta\varepsilon_0 \alt

training of deep neural networks, there exists no general method for
identifying when they lead to equivalent, or non-equivalent, optimization
trajectories. By viewing iterative optimization as a discrete-time dynamical
system, we are able to leverage Koopman operator theory, where it is known that
conjugate dynamics can have identical spectral objects. We find highly
overlapping Koopman spectra associated with the application of online mirror

the two optimizers. We extend our analysis to feedforward, fully connected

  Approximations for Variational Inference",,,,,"stat.ML stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When factorized approximations are used for variational inference (VI), they
tend to underestimate the uncertainty -- as measured in various ways -- of the
distributions they are meant to approximate. We consider two popular ways to
measure the uncertainty deficit of VI: (i) the degree to which it
underestimates the componentwise variance, and (ii) the degree to which it
underestimates the entropy. To better understand these effects, and the
relationship between them, we examine an informative setting where they can be
explicitly (and elegantly) analyzed: the approximation of a Gaussian,~$p$, with
a dense covariance matrix, by a Gaussian,~$q$, with a diagonal covariance
matrix. We prove that $q$ always underestimates both the componentwise variance
and the entropy of $p$, \textit{though not necessarily to the same degree}.
Moreover we demonstrate that the entropy of $q$ is determined by the trade-off
of two competing forces: it is decreased by the shrinkage of its componentwise
variances (our first measure of uncertainty) but it is increased by the
factorized approximation which delinks the nodes in the graphical model of $p$.
We study various manifestations of this trade-off, notably one where, as the
dimension of the problem grows, the per-component entropy gap between $p$ and
$q$ becomes vanishingly small even though $q$ underestimates every
componentwise variance by a constant multiplicative factor. We also use the
shrinkage-delinkage trade-off to bound the entropy gap in terms of the problem
dimension and the condition number of the correlation matrix of $p$. Finally we
present empirical results on both Gaussian and non-Gaussian targets, the former
to validate our analysis and the latter to explore its limitations.

to increase the light yield in the most critical regions of the Cosmic-Ray Veto

used in many of the detector's critical modules instead of the previously

utility (e.g., accuracy) of the model. However, the mutual interactions between
fairness, privacy, and utility are less well-understood. As a result, often
only one objective is optimized, while the others are tuned as
hyper-parameters. Because they implicitly prioritize certain objectives, such
designs bias the model in pernicious, undetectable ways. To address this, we
adopt impartiality as a principle: design of ML pipelines should not favor one

us with accurate Pareto frontiers that show the inherent trade-offs between the
objectives. Extending two canonical ML frameworks for privacy-preserving
learning, we provide two methods (FairDP-SGD and FairPATE) to train
impartially-specified models and recover the Pareto frontier. Through
theoretical privacy analysis and a comprehensive empirical study, we provide an
answer to the question of where fairness mitigation should be integrated within
a privacy-aware ML pipeline.

study the structure of the data at different geographical levels in a way that

Authentication is critical to ensure a package is picked up by a legitimate

important packages, a drone should stay away from users until the
authentication succeeds. Thus, authentication approaches that require physical
contact of drones cannot be applied. Bluetooth can indicate proximity without
physical contact but is vulnerable to radio relay attacks. Our work leverages
drone noises for authentication. While using sounds for authentication is
highly usable, how to handle various attacks that manipulate sounds is an
unresolved challenge. It is also unclear whether such a system is robust under
various environmental sounds. We address these challenges by exploiting unique

introduce a multi-task learning framework for a binary-class RawNet2 model that
shares the front-end feature extractor with a vocoder identification module. We
treat the vocoder identification as a pretext task to constrain the front-end
feature extractor to focus on vocoder artifacts and provide discriminative
features for the final binary classifier. Our experiments show that the
improved RawNet2 model based on vocoder identification achieves an overall high

methods, such as anomaly detection, can save significant human effort. A
typically used approach for anomaly detection is to learn the images from
healthy subjects only, assuming the model will detect the images from diseased
subjects as outliers. However, in many real-world scenarios, unannotated
datasets with a mix of healthy and diseased individuals are available. Recent
studies have shown improvement in unsupervised disease/anomaly detection using
such datasets of unannotated images from healthy and diseased individuals
compared to datasets that only include images from healthy individuals. A major
issue remains unaddressed in these studies, which is selecting the best model

address this issue, we propose Brainomaly, a GAN-based image-to-image

brain MRIs and generate MRIs of corresponding healthy brains. Instead of
generating the healthy images directly, Brainomaly generates an additive map

image look healthy. In addition, Brainomaly uses a pseudo-AUC metric for
inference model selection, which further improves the detection performance.

remarkable. By investigating the thermal conductivity of twist bilayer graphene
(TBG), here we reveal that the trivial twist-angle effect on phononic property
observed in previous studies is owing to the non-localization nature of
phonons. This characteristic makes phonons hardly trapped by the weak
interlayer potentials induced by the twist-angle dependent Moir\'e pattern. We
propose that the twist-angle effect can be effectively enhanced by increasing
the interface coupling. In use of a sandwich structure composed of h-BN and
TBG, we demonstrate that the thermal conductivity of TBG can be either
significantly increased or dramatically decreased, under the synergistic
modulation of interlayer coupling strength and twist angle. Particularly, the
twist-angle effect can lead to a nontrivial reduction of thermal conductivity
up to 78% when a strong interlayer coupling is applied. The reduction is
several times larger than that observed in the freestanding TBG where the
reduction is attributed to the twist-angle dependent phonon scatterings induced
by the edge phonons. The underlying mechanism for the giant twist-angle
dependence of thermal conductivity is further revealed on the basis of phonon
transport theory. Our findings provide a platform for achieving efficient
twist-angle modulation on phonon transport property of vdW materials.

leading cause of disability and suicide worldwide. An automated system capable
of detecting signs of depression in human speech can contribute to ensuring
timely and effective mental health care for individuals suffering from the
disorder. Developing such automated system requires accurate machine learning
models, capable of capturing signs of depression. However, state-of-the-art
models based on deep acoustic representations require abundant data, meticulous
selection of features, and rigorous training; the procedure involves enormous
computational resources. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of two
different acoustic feature groups - conventional hand-curated and deep
representation features, for predicting the severity of depression from speech.
We explore the relevance of possible contributing factors to the models'
performance, including gender of the individual, severity of the disorder,
content and length of speech. Our findings suggest that models trained on
conventional acoustic features perform equally well or better than the ones
trained on deep representation features at significantly lower computational
cost, irrespective of other factors, e.g. content and length of speech, gender
of the speaker and severity of the disorder. This makes such models a better
fit for deployment where availability of computational resources is restricted,

neutron star mergers are the only astrophysical sites capable of producing
r-process elements. Simulations have shown that 0.01-0.1M$_\odot$ of r-process
material could be generated in the outflows originating from the accretion disk
surrounding the rapidly rotating black hole that forms as a remnant to both
neutron star mergers and collapsing massive stars associated with long-duration
gamma-ray bursts (collapsars). The hallmark signature of r-process
nucleosynthesis in the binary neutron star merger GW170817 was its long-lasting
near-infrared emission, thus motivating a systematic photometric study of the
light curves of broadlined stripped-envelope (Ic-BL) supernovae (SNe)
associated with collapsars. We present the first systematic study of 25 SNe
Ic-BL -- discovered with the Zwicky Transient Facility and from the literature
-- in the optical/near-infrared bands to determine what quantity of r-process
material, if any, is synthesized in these explosions. Using semi-analytic
models designed to account for r-process production in SNe Ic-BL, we perform
light curve fitting to derive constraints on the r-process mass for these SNe.
We also perform independent light curve fits to models without r-process. We
find that the r-process-free models are a better fit to the light curves of the
objects in our sample. Thus we conclude that there is no compelling evidence of
r-process enrichment in any of our objects. Further high-cadence infrared
photometric studies and nebular spectroscopic analysis would be sensitive to
smaller quantities of r-process ejecta mass or indicate whether all collapsars
are completely devoid of r-process nucleosynthesis.

with a charge neutrality level lying near the valence band maximum. Sb
termination was observed to shift the surface Fermi-level position by up to
$254 \pm 35$ meV towards the conduction band on the InSb (001) surface and $60
\pm 35$ meV towards the conduction band on the InSb(111)B surface. The surface
Sb on the (001) can shift the surface from electron depletion to electron
accumulation. We propose the shift in the Fermi-level pinning is due to charge
transfer from Sb clusters on the Sb terminated surfaces. Additionally, many
sub-gap states were observed for the (111)B (3x1) surface, which are attributed
to the disordered nature of this surface. This work demonstrates the tuning of
the Fermi-level pinning position of InSb surfaces with Sb termination.

$O(g(1/T)^2 /n)$ at iteration $T$, provided there are at least
$m=\Omega(g(1/T)^4)$ hidden neurons. We then show that our realizable setting
encompasses a special case where data are separable by the model's neural
tangent kernel. For this and logistic-loss minimization, we prove the training
loss decays at a rate of $\tilde O(1/ T)$ given polylogarithmic number of

results differ from existing generalization outcomes using the
algorithmic-stability framework, which necessitate polynomial width and yield
suboptimal generalization rates. Central to our analysis is the use of a new
self-bounded weak-convexity property, which leads to a generalized local
quasi-convexity property for sufficiently parameterized neural-network
classifiers. Eventually, despite the objective's non-convexity, this leads to
convergence and generalization-gap bounds that resemble those found in the

coding. Directly training SNN by spike-based backpropagation (BP) such as
surrogate gradient approximation is more flexible. Yet now, the performance of

k-based leaky Integrate-and-Fire (KLIF) neuron model to improve the learning

firing and resetting. The proposed spiking unit is evaluated on both static

performs much better than LIF without introducing additional computational cost

Thus, through its impoverished models of us, ML currently falls far short of
its exciting potential, which is for it to help us to reach ours. While there
is no consensus on defining human flourishing, from diverse perspectives across
psychology, philosophy, and spiritual traditions, love is understood to be one
of its primary catalysts. Motivated by this view, this paper explores whether
there is a useful conception of love fitting for machines to embody, as
historically it has been generative to explore whether a nebulous concept, such

candidate conception of machine love, inspired in particular by work in

Through proof of concept experiments, this paper aims to highlight the need for
richer models of human flourishing in ML, provide an example framework through
which positive psychology can be combined with ML to realize a rough conception
of machine love, and demonstrate that current language models begin to enable
embodying qualitative humanistic principles. The conclusion is that though at

higher precision milling capability of the noble gas neon ion beam. Using a

frustrates composition analysis of these materials due to implantation,

First draft: June 2019",,"10.2139/ssrn.3394012",,"econ.EM stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  High covariate dimensionality is an increasingly occurrent phenomenon in
model estimation. A common approach to handling high-dimensionality is
regularisation, which requires sparsity of model parameters. However, sparsity
may not always be supported by economic theory or easily verified in some
empirical contexts; severe bias and misleading inference can occur. This paper
introduces a grouped parameter estimator (GPE) that circumvents this problem by
using a parameter clustering technique. The large sample properties of the GPE
hold under fairly standard conditions including a compact parameter support
that can be bounded away from zero. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the
excellent performance of the GPE relative to competing estimators in terms of
bias and size control. Lastly, an empirical application of the GPE to the
estimation of price and income elasticities of demand for gasoline illustrates
the practical utility of the GPE.

challenge. Multiple energetic events contribute to maintaining the corona at
such high temperatures. The energy released in different events can vary across
several orders of magnitude. Large energy events of geomagnetic importance like
flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) contribute little to the global
energetics of the solar corona. Therefore, events with several (9-10) orders of
magnitudes of lower energy, with much higher frequency of occurrence, need to
be studied in great detail. Observations suggest that these impulsive events
with different energies follow a power-law distribution, indicating a common
underlying mechanism. We perform observation-motivated modeling of coronal
loops (magnetic flux tubes) to understand the energetics of these small
transient events and their similarity with impulsive events like flares. This
thesis uses the EBTEL code based on the 0D hydrodynamical description of
coronal loops. This approach is appropriate for getting quick estimates of the
energetics of the system over a wide range of parameters. We then discuss the
improvement of EBTEL to make it suitable over a broader range of parameters.
This is followed by using improved EBTEL to explore the possibility of
simulating impulsive events of different energy generated using a single
power-law distribution. Comparison between observed emissions from various
components of multi-thermal plasma and hydrodynamical models suggest the
heating to be impulsive. Since field-aligned flows induced due to impulsive
events are a crucial part of our modeling of coronal loops, we discuss the
implications of such flows in the context of transition region heating.

clouds assemble from and interact with the atomic gas are still largely
unknown. As a result of new observations of the 158~$\mu$m line of ionized

evidence that CII unveils dynamic interactions between cloud ensembles. This
process is neither a head-on collision of fully molecular clouds nor a gentle
merging ofonly atomic clouds. Moreover, we demonstrate that the dense molecular

higher velocity are embedded in atomic gas and all components interact over a
large range of velocities (20 km/s). The atomic gas has a density of 100

with the purpose to learn a model that performs well over $m$ different
distributions. First, we formulate GDRO as a stochastic convex-concave
saddle-point problem, and demonstrate that stochastic mirror descent (SMD),
using $m$ samples in each iteration, achieves an $O(m (\log m)/\epsilon^2)$
sample complexity for finding an $\epsilon$-optimal solution, which matches the
$\Omega(m/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Then, we make
use of techniques from online learning to reduce the number of samples required
in each round from $m$ to $1$, keeping the same sample complexity.
Specifically, we cast GDRO as a two-players game where one player simply
performs SMD and the other executes an online algorithm for non-oblivious
multi-armed bandits. Next, we consider a more practical scenario where the
number of samples that can be drawn from each distribution is different, and
propose a novel formulation of weighted GDRO, which allows us to derive
distribution-dependent convergence rates. Denote by $n_i$ the sample budget for
the $i$-th distribution, and assume $n_1 \geq n_2 \geq \cdots \geq n_m$. In the
first approach, we incorporate non-uniform sampling into SMD such that the
sample budget is satisfied in expectation, and prove the excess risk of the
$i$-th distribution decreases at an $O(\sqrt{n_1 \log m}/n_i)$ rate. In the
second approach, we use mini-batches to meet the budget exactly and also reduce
the variance in stochastic gradients, and then leverage stochastic mirror-prox
algorithm, which can exploit small variances, to optimize a carefully designed
weighted GDRO problem. Under appropriate conditions, it attains an $O((\log
m)/\sqrt{n_i})$ convergence rate, which almost matches the optimal
$O(\sqrt{1/n_i})$ rate of only learning from the $i$-th distribution with $n_i$

self-supervised training, we employ the representative denoising objective

evolutions is the one governed by U(1) symmetric Hamiltonians, initialized in a
state which breaks the U(1) symmetry -- the paradigmatic example being the
evolution of the so-called one-axis-twisting (OAT) model, featuring
infinite-range interactions between spins. In this work we show that the
dynamics of the OAT model can be closely reproduced by systems with
power-law-decaying interactions, thanks to an effective separation between the
zero-momentum degrees of freedom, associated with the so-called Anderson tower
of states, and reconstructing a OAT model; and finite-momentum ones, associated
with spin-wave excitations. This mechanism explains quantitatively the recent

and multimessenger astrophysics. However, the spatial localization, imaging
capabilities and sensitivity of the measurements are strongly limited for the
energy range > 70 keV. To overcome these limitations, we have proposed a
mission concept, ASTENA, submitted to ESA for its program Voyage 2050. We will
report on a pathfinder of ASTENA, that we intend to propose to ASI as an
Italian mission with international participation. It will be based on one of
the two instruments aboard ASTENA: a Laue lens with 20 m focal length, able to
focus hard X-rays in the 50-700 keV passband into a 3-d position sensitive
focal plane spectrometer. The combination of the focussing properties of the
lens and of the localization properties of the detector will provide
unparalleled imaging and spectroscopic capabilities, thus enabling studies of
phenomena such as gamma-ray bursts afterglows, supernova explosions, positron
annihilation lines and many more.

Decision Process (MDP) models to learn and plan efficiently in an unknown but
similar MDP. We refer to it as \textit{Model Transfer Reinforcement Learning

Quadratic Regulators (LQRs) with continuous state actions. Then, we propose a
generic two-stage algorithm, MLEMTRL, to address the MTRL problem in discrete
and continuous settings. In the first stage, MLEMTRL uses a \textit{constrained
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)}-based approach to estimate the target MDP
model using a set of known MDP models. In the second stage, using the estimated
target MDP model, MLEMTRL deploys a model-based planning algorithm appropriate
for the MDP class. Theoretically, we prove worst-case regret bounds for MLEMTRL
both in realisable and non-realisable settings. We empirically demonstrate that
MLEMTRL allows faster learning in new MDPs than learning from scratch and
achieves near-optimal performance depending on the similarity of the available
MDPs and the target MDP.

limitation for heating efficiency because of the excessive free-carrier loss

new concept of using optically transparent 2D semiconductors (e.g. MoS2) for

optical absorption in the infrared can be placed in close proximity (only 30nm)

applying structural controllability analysis of complex networks to several
Unfolded Protein Response networks to identify crucial nodes in the signaling
flow. In particular, we first build different network models of the Unfolded
Protein Response mechanism, relying on data contained in various
protein-protein interaction databases. Then, we identify the driver nodes,
essential for overall network control, i.e., the key proteins on which external
stimulation may be optimally delivered to control network behavior. Our
structural controllability analysis results show that the driver nodes commonly
identified across databases match with known endoplasmic reticulum stress
sensors. This potentially confirms that the theoretically identified drivers
correspond to the biological key proteins associated with fundamental cellular
activities and diseases. In conclusion, we prove that structural
controllability is a reliable quantitative tool to investigate biological
signaling pathways, and it can be potentially applied to networks more complex

hyperpolarized tracer currently under evaluation in several clinical trials as
a promising molecular imaging agent. Still, the quest for a simple, fast, and
efficient hyperpolarization technique is ongoing. Here, we describe that
continuous, weak irradiation in the audio-frequency range of the 13C spin at
121 {\mu}T magnetic field (\sim twiceEarth\apos s field) enables spin order
transfer from parahydrogen to 13C magnetization of 1-13C-pyruvate. These
so-called LIGHT-SABRE pulses couple nuclear spin states of parahydrogen and
pyruvate via the J-coupling network of reversibly exchanging Ir-complexes.
Using \sim 100% parahydrogen at ambient pressure, we polarized 51 mM of
1-13C-pyruvate in the presence of 5.1 mM Ir-complex continuously and repeatedly
to a polarization of 1.1% averaged over free and catalyst-bound pyruvate. The
experiments were conducted at -8{\deg}C), where almost exclusively bound
pyruvate was observed, corresponding to an estimated 11% polarization on bound
pyruvate. The obtained hyperpolarization levels closely match those obtained
via SABRE-SHEATH under otherwise identical conditions. The creation of three
different types of spin orders was observed: transverse 13C magnetization along
the applied magnetic field, 13C z-magnetization along the main field B_0, and
13C-1H zz-spin-order. With a superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) for detection, we found that the generated spin orders result from tiny
1H-13C J-coupling interactions, which are not visible even with our narrow

explore the dynamics of multi-dimensional structures, by means of a

energetic (suprathermal, kappa-distributed) electron population in combination
with heavy (immobile) dust in the background. The modulational (in)stability
profile of DIA wavepackets for both negative as well as positive dust charge is
investigated. A set of explicit criteria for modulational instability (MI) to
occur is obtained. Wavepacket modulation properties in 3D dusty plasmas are
shown to differ from e.g. Maxwellian plasmas in 1D. Stronger negative dust
concentration results in a narrower instability window in the $K$ (perturbation
wavenumber) domain and a suppressed growth rate. In the opposite manner, the
instability growth rate increases for higher positive dust concentrations and
the instability window gets larger. In a nutshell, negative dust seems to
suppress instability while positive dust appears to favor the amplitude
modulation instability mechanism.

there are instances where there is a lack of agreement between the two. This
can occur when models are derived from incomplete theories, when a
better-fitting model is not available or when measurement uncertainties are not

closeness of the astrophysical model to the observations. To draw conclusions
on the consistency hypothesis, a simulation-based methodology is performed. In

  Learning","accepted by CVPR 2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) is a recently emerging task that
tackles few-shot learning across different domains. It aims at transferring
prior knowledge learned on the source dataset to novel target datasets. The
CD-FSL task is especially challenged by the huge domain gap between different
datasets. Critically, such a domain gap actually comes from the changes of
visual styles, and wave-SAN empirically shows that spanning the style
distribution of the source data helps alleviate this issue. However, wave-SAN
simply swaps styles of two images. Such a vanilla operation makes the generated
styles ``real'' and ``easy'', which still fall into the original set of the
source styles. Thus, inspired by vanilla adversarial learning, a novel
model-agnostic meta Style Adversarial training (StyleAdv) method together with
a novel style adversarial attack method is proposed for CD-FSL. Particularly,
our style attack method synthesizes both ``virtual'' and ``hard'' adversarial
styles for model training. This is achieved by perturbing the original style
with the signed style gradients. By continually attacking styles and forcing
the model to recognize these challenging adversarial styles, our model is
gradually robust to the visual styles, thus boosting the generalization ability
for novel target datasets. Besides the typical CNN-based backbone, we also
employ our StyleAdv method on large-scale pretrained vision transformer.
Extensive experiments conducted on eight various target datasets show the
effectiveness of our method. Whether built upon ResNet or ViT, we achieve the
new state of the art for CD-FSL. Code is available at

Learning allows learning new-class data on the fly, the learning process is
generally conducted on the cloud, requiring constant data exchange between

propose PILOTE, which pushes the incremental learning process to the extreme
edge, while providing reliable data privacy and practical utility, e.g., low

practical challenge of extremely limited data during the incremental learning

show poor estimation accuracy of many LDP protocols under malicious threat
models. Although a few works have proposed some countermeasures to address
these attacks, they all require prior knowledge of either the attacking pattern

that detect poison values on individual basis, DAP mitigates the overall impact
of poison values on the estimated mean. It relies on a new probing mechanism
EMF (i.e., Expectation-Maximization Filter) to estimate features of the

ports on a computing endpoint to determine which ports are open and which
services are running on them. It is a common method used by hackers to identify
vulnerabilities in a network or system. By determining which ports are open, an
attacker can identify which services and applications are running on a device
and potentially exploit any known vulnerabilities in those services.
Consequently, it is important to detect port scanning because it is often the
first step in a cyber attack. By identifying port scanning attempts,
cybersecurity professionals can take proactive measures to protect the systems
and networks before an attacker has a chance to exploit any vulnerabilities.
Against this background, researchers have worked for over a decade to develop
robust methods to detect port scanning. One such method revealed by a recent
systematic review is the random forest supervised machine learning algorithm.
The review revealed six existing studies using random forest since 2021.
Unfortunately, those studies each exhibit different results, do not all use the

Accordingly, the goal of this work was to reproduce the six random forest
studies while addressing the apparent shortcomings. The outcomes are

We introduce a generic formulation of spectral filters on heterogeneous graphs

propose Laguerre polynomial approximations of HL spectral filters and prove
that their spatial localization on graphs is related to the polynomial order.
Furthermore, based on the bijection property of boundary operators on simplex
graphs, we introduce a generic topological graph pooling (TGPool) method that
can be used at any dimensional simplices. This study designs HL-node, HL-edge,
and HL-HGCNN neural networks to learn signal representation at a graph node,
edge levels, and both, respectively. Our experiments employ fMRI from the
Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD; n=7693) to predict general
intelligence. Our results demonstrate the advantage of the HL-edge network over
the HL-node network when functional brain connectivity is considered as
features. The HL-HGCNN outperforms the state-of-the-art graph neural networks
(GNNs) approaches, such as GAT, BrainGNN, dGCN, BrainNetCNN, and Hypergraph NN.
The functional connectivity features learned from the HL-HGCNN are meaningful

necessary foundation for any form of systematic response to flakiness, such as
test quarantining or automated debugging. Previous research has proposed

Instead, we rely only on the most commonly available artifacts, namely the

this premise and use instance difficulty methods (like Prediction Depth) to
quantify ""easy"" and to identify this behavior during the training phase. (3) We
empirically show that shortcut learning can be detected by observing the
learning dynamics of the DNN's early layers, irrespective of the network
architecture used. In other words, easy features learned by the initial layers
of a DNN early during the training are potential shortcuts. We verify our
claims on simulated and real medical imaging data and justify the empirical
success of our hypothesis by showing the theoretical connections between
Prediction Depth and information-theoretic concepts like V-usable information.
Lastly, our experiments show the insufficiency of monitoring only accuracy
plots during training (as is common in machine learning pipelines), and we
highlight the need for monitoring early training dynamics using example
difficulty metrics.

Phenomenon caused by CAD: language models only focus on causal features that
are edited in the augmentation and exclude other non-edited causal features. As
a result, the potential of CAD is not fully exploited. Based on the structural
properties of CAD, we design two additional constraints to help language models
extract more complete causal features contained in CAD, thus improving the OOD
generalization capability. We evaluate our method on two tasks: Sentiment

generative models for natural images. Autoencoders often use generic deep
networks as the encoder or decoder, which are difficult to interpret, and the
learned representations lack clear structure. In this work, we make the
explicit assumption that the image distribution is generated from a multi-stage
sparse deconvolution. The corresponding inverse map, which we use as an
encoder, is a multi-stage convolution sparse coding (CSC), with each stage
obtained from unrolling an optimization algorithm for solving the corresponding
(convexified) sparse coding program. To avoid computational difficulties in
minimizing distributional distance between the real and generated images, we
utilize the recent closed-loop transcription (CTRL) framework that optimizes
the rate reduction of the learned sparse representations. Conceptually, our
method has high-level connections to score-matching methods such as diffusion
models. Empirically, our framework demonstrates competitive performance on
large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K, compared to existing autoencoding
and generative methods under fair conditions. Even with simpler networks and
fewer computational resources, our method demonstrates high visual quality in
regenerated images. More surprisingly, the learned autoencoder performs well on
unseen datasets. Our method enjoys several side benefits, including more
structured and interpretable representations, more stable convergence, and
scalability to large datasets. Our method is arguably the first to demonstrate
that a concatenation of multiple convolution sparse coding/decoding layers
leads to an interpretable and effective autoencoder for modeling the

  with Partial CSI","Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, Partial CSI",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have recently been proposed
to compensate for the severe multiplicative fading effect of conventional
passive RIS-aided systems. Each reflecting element of active RISs is assisted
by an amplifier such that the incident signal can be reflected and amplified
instead of only being reflected as in passive RIS-aided systems. This work
addresses the practical challenge that, on the one hand, in active RIS-aided
systems the perfect individual CSI of the RIS-aided channels cannot be acquired
due to the lack of signal processing power at the active RISs, but, on the
other hand, this CSI is required to calculate the expected system data rate and
RIS transmit power needed for transceiver design. To address this issue, we
first derive closed-form expressions for the average achievable rate and the
average RIS transmit power based on partial CSI of the RIS-aided channels.
Then, we formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem for jointly
optimizing the active beamforming at both the base station (BS) and the RIS.
This problem is then tackled using the majorization--minimization (MM)
algorithm framework, and, for each iteration, semi-closed-form solutions for
the BS and RIS beamforming are derived based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
conditions. To ensure the quality of service (QoS) of each user, we further
formulate a rate outage constrained beamforming problem, which is solved using
the Bernstein-Type inequality (BTI) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR)
techniques. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can efficiently
overcome the challenges imposed by imperfect CSI in active RIS-aided wireless
systems.

to add stabilization to the resulting ROM to increase the stability and
accuracy of the method; the addition of stabilization is particularly common
for advection-dominated systems when the ROM is under-resolved. While these two
approaches can be equivalent in certain settings, differing techniques have
emerged in both contexts. This work outlines these two approaches within the
setting of finite element method (FEM) discretizations (in which case a duality
exists between the continuous and discrete levels) of the
convection-diffusion-reaction equation, and compares residual-based
stabilization techniques that have been developed in both contexts. In the

global dependencies in feature extraction and propagation. To address these
differences, we propose a new vision Transformer, called Hybrid Network
Transformer (Hyneter), after pre-experiments that indicate the gap causes
CNN-based and Transformer-based methods to increase size-different objects
result unevenly. Different from the divide and conquer strategy in previous
methods, Hyneters consist of Hybrid Network Backbone (HNB) and Dual Switching

transfer them simultaneously. Based on the balance strategy, HNB extends the
range of local information by embedding convolution layers into Transformer
blocks, and DS adjusts excessive reliance on global dependencies outside the

simplified and facilitated if the pertinent switching function is symmetric or
it is expressed in a disjoint sum-of-products form. We provide a tutorial

computing the Banzhaf index by way of two prominent voting systems. These are
scalar systems involving six variables and nine variables, respectively. The

  Language Development and Translation",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Natural Language-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) enables the agents
to follow human instructions. Previous approaches generally implemented
language-conditioned RL by providing human instructions in natural language
(NL) and training a following policy. In this outside-in approach, the policy
needs to comprehend the NL and manage the task simultaneously. However, the
unbounded NL examples often bring much extra complexity for solving concrete RL
tasks, which can distract policy learning from completing the task. To ease the
learning burden of the policy, we investigate an inside-out scheme for natural
language-conditioned RL by developing a task language (TL) that is task-related
and unique. The TL is used in RL to achieve highly efficient and effective
policy training. Besides, a translator is trained to translate NL into TL. We
implement this scheme as TALAR (TAsk Language with predicAte Representation)
that learns multiple predicates to model object relationships as the TL.
Experiments indicate that TALAR not only better comprehends NL instructions but
also leads to a better instruction-following policy that improves 13.4% success
rate and adapts to unseen expressions of NL instruction. The TL can also be an
effective task abstraction, naturally compatible with hierarchical RL.

resource-limited deep learning tasks to save memory, accelerate training, and
reduce inference time, the reliability of the produced sparse models remains
unexplored. Previous research has shown that deep neural networks tend to be
over-confident, and we find that sparse training exacerbates this problem.
Therefore, calibrating the sparse models is crucial for reliable prediction and
decision-making. In this paper, we propose a new sparse training method to
produce sparse models with improved confidence calibration. In contrast to
previous research that uses only one mask to control the sparse topology, our
method utilizes two masks, including a deterministic mask and a random mask.
The former efficiently searches and activates important weights by exploiting
the magnitude of weights and gradients. While the latter brings better
exploration and finds more appropriate weight values by random updates.
Theoretically, we prove our method can be viewed as a hierarchical variational
approximation of a probabilistic deep Gaussian process. Extensive experiments
on multiple datasets, model architectures, and sparsities show that our method
reduces ECE values by up to 47.8\% and simultaneously maintains or even
improves accuracy with only a slight increase in computation and storage

of $\log \left(M_{\bullet}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \right) = 7.0$, uncertain by
$\sim0.4$ dex. High cadence photometric monitoring over two years with the Las
Cumbres Observatory provides lightcurves in 7 optical bands suitable for
intensive continuum reverberation mapping. We identify variability on two
timescales. Slower variations on a 100-day timescale exhibit excess flux and
increased lag in the $u'$ band and are thus attributable to diffuse bound-free
continuum emission from the broad line region. Faster variations that we
attribute to accretion disc reprocessing lack a $u'$-band excess and have flux
and delay spectra consistent with either $\tau \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, as
expected for a temperature structure of $T(R) \propto R^{-3/4}$ for a thin
accretion disc, or $\tau \propto \lambda^{2}$ expected for a slim disc.
Decomposing the flux into variable (disc) and constant (host galaxy)
components, we find the disc SED to be flatter than expected with $f_{\nu} \sim
\rm{const}$. Modelling the SED predicts an Eddington ratio of $\lambda_{\rm
Edd} > 1$, where the flat spectrum can be reproduced by a slim disc with little
dust extinction or a thin disc which requires more dust extinction. While this
accretion is super-Eddington, the geometry is still unclear, however a slim
disc is expected due to the high radiation pressure at these accretion rates,
and is entirely consistent with our observations.

stochastic background of gravitational waves. The spectrum of such emission
depends on both the mass and the spin of the black holes, as well as on the
redshifting that occurs between the black hole formation and today. This, in
turn, depends on the expansion history of the universe, which is largely
unknown and unconstrained at times prior to the synthesis of light elements.
Here, we explore the features of the stochastic background of gravitational
waves from black hole evaporation under a broad range of possible early
cosmological histories. The resulting gravitational wave signals typically peak
at very high frequencies, and offer opportunities for proposed ultra-high
frequency gravitational wave detectors. Lower-frequency peaks are also
possible, albeit with a suppressed intensity that is likely well below the
threshold of detectability. We find that the largest intensity peaks correspond
to cosmologies dominated by fluids with equations of state that have large
pressure-to-density ratios. Such scenarios can be constrained on the basis of
violation of $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ bounds.

the current immersive systems. VR and the consequent deception of perception
pose an interesting question: is it possible to deceive the mind to the point
of not being able to recognize whether the perceived reality is real or
simulated? In addition to this question, another question arises spontaneously:
is it possible to simulate a non-reality in which the physical laws do not
apply? The answer to the first question is that it would theoretically be
possible to deceive the mind to the point of not being able to recognize
whether the perceived reality is real or simulated, furthermore it is also
possible to simulate a non-real, i.e. magical, world. However, this possibility
is based on hiding degrees of freedom from the observer, therefore it requires
the complicity of the observer to be realised. It can be said that a VR system
can simulate both a real and non-real experience. For an observer, a virtual
reality experience is still an experience of reality. This experience can be
exchanged for a different experience, that is, for a different reality that can
be real or not real.

the contrary, the capture of multiple noisy frames for the same field of view
is available and often natural in real life. Therefore, it is necessary to
avoid the restriction of clean labels and make full use of noisy data for model
training. So we propose an unsupervised learning strategy named one-pot
denoising (OPD) for multi-frame images. OPD is the first proposed unsupervised
multi-frame denoising (MFD) method. Different from the traditional supervision
schemes including both supervised Noise2Clean (N2C) and unsupervised
Noise2Noise (N2N), OPD executes mutual supervision among all of the multiple
frames, which gives learning more diversity of supervision and allows models to
mine deeper into the correlation among frames. N2N has also been proved to be
actually a simplified case of the proposed OPD. From the perspectives of data
allocation and loss function, two specific implementations, random coupling

during model training. In practice, our experiments demonstrate that OPD
behaves as the SOTA unsupervised denoising method and is comparable to
supervised N2C methods for synthetic Gaussian and Poisson noise, and real-world

dots) governs the properties and performance of the bottom-up fabricated

methods that permit to resolve the electronic density of states of these
nanoscale materials (of which quantum dots are a particular example) are of
great importance for the development of man-made nanoscale interfaces and
nanoelectronics. In the present work, we propose the quantum rate spectroscopy
methodology (and introduce the fundamental physical basis of this technique) as
a tool for resolving the electronic structure of zero-dimensional (quantum dot)
structures at room temperature and environmental pressure conditions. This
method is simpler than the traditional methods based on scanning tunneling
microscopy. This spectroscopic approach based on the quantum rate theory was
demonstrated for CdTe quantum dots, and was used to measure a spectrum that
provides discrete energy levels that are consistent with those obtained by
tunneling microscopy measurements.

considered are those which are related to the particles nature: bosons or
fermions. These corrections lead respectively to the Bose-Einstein and
Fermi-Dirac statistics. However, in this work, other kinds of corrections which
are related to the quantum nature of phase space are considered. These
corrections are introduced as improvement in the expression of the partition
function of an ideal gas. Then corrected thermodynamics properties of the gas
are deduced. Both the non-relativistic quantum and relativistic quantum cases
are considered. It is shown that the corrections in the non-relativistic
quantum case may be particularly useful to describe the deviation from
classical behavior of a Maxwell-Boltzmann gas at low temperature and in
confined space. These corrections can be considered as including the
description of quantum size and shape effects. For the relativistic quantum
case, the corrections could be relevant for confined space and when the thermal
energy of each particle is comparable to their rest energy. The corrections
appear mainly as modifications in the thermodynamic equation of state and in
the expressions of the partition function and thermodynamic functions like
entropy, internal energy, and free energy. Classical expressions are obtained
as asymptotic limits.

bitcoin and ethereum, on the one side, and the instruments representing the

address the question whether the cryptocurrency market still preserves its
autonomy with respect to the traditional financial markets or it has already
aligned with them in expense of its independence. We are motivated by the fact
that some previous related studies gave mixed results. By calculating the
$q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient based on the high
frequency 10 s data in the rolling window, the dependence on various time
scales, different fluctuation magnitudes, and different market periods are
examined. There is a strong indication that the dynamics of the bitcoin and
ethereum price changes since the March 2020 Covid-19 panic is no longer
independent. Instead, it is related to the dynamics of the traditional
financial markets, which is especially evident now in 2022, when the bitcoin
and ethereum coupling to the US tech stocks is observed during the market bear
phase. It is also worth emphasizing that the cryptocurrencies have begun to
react to the economic data such as the Consumer Price Index readings in a
similar way as traditional instruments. Such a spontaneous coupling of the so
far independent degrees of freedom can be interpreted as a kind of phase
transition that resembles the collective phenomena typical for the complex
systems. Our results indicate that the cryptocurrencies cannot be considered as
a safe haven for the financial investments.

  Heading towards Evolution or Degradation?","First version",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the span of a few months, generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools
that can generate realistic images or text have taken the Internet by storm,
making them one of the technologies with fastest adoption ever. Some of these
generative AI tools such as DALL-E, MidJourney, or ChatGPT have gained wide
public notoriety. Interestingly, these tools are possible because of the
massive amount of data (text and images) available on the Internet. The tools
are trained on massive data sets that are scraped from Internet sites. And now,
these generative AI tools are creating massive amounts of new data that are
being fed into the Internet. Therefore, future versions of generative AI tools
will be trained with Internet data that is a mix of original and AI-generated
data. As time goes on, a mixture of original data and data generated by
different versions of AI tools will populate the Internet. This raises a few
intriguing questions: how will future versions of generative AI tools behave
when trained on a mixture of real and AI generated data? Will they evolve with
the new data sets or degenerate? Will evolution introduce biases in subsequent
generations of generative AI tools? In this document, we explore these
questions and report some very initial simulation results using a simple
image-generation AI tool. These results suggest that the quality of the
generated images degrades as more AI-generated data is used for training thus
suggesting that generative AI may degenerate. Although these results are
preliminary and cannot be generalised without further study, they serve to
illustrate the potential issues of the interaction between generative AI and
the Internet.

and a weak electric field, it reduces to the photonic non-linear model worked
out by the authors of ref. [3]. We pursue our investigation of the proposed
model by analyzing properties of the permittivity and permeability tensors, the
energy-momentum tensor and wave propagation effects in presence of a uniform
magnetic background. It is shown that the electrodynamics here presented
exhibits the vacuum birefringence phenomenon. Subsequently, we calculate the
lowest-order modifications to the interaction energy, considering still the
presence of a uniform external magnetic field. Our analysis is carried out
within the framework of the gauge-invariant but path-dependent variables
formalism. The calculation reveals a screened Coulomb-like potential with an
effective electric charge that runs with the external magnetic field but, as
expected for Dirac-type materials, the screening disappears whenever the
external magnetic field is switched off.

NP-Hard. Traditional deployment methods revealed the existence of a starvation
problem, which the researchers failed to recognize. Basically, starvation here,
means the longer waiting times and eventual rejection of low-priority services
due to a 'time out'. The contribution of this work is threefold: a) explain the
existence of the starvation problem in the existing methods and their
drawbacks, b) introduce 'Adaptive Scheduling' (AdSch) which is an 'intelligent
scheduling' scheme using a three-factor approach (priority, threshold waiting
time, and reliability), which proves to be more reasonable than traditional
methods solely based on priority, and c) a 'Dynamic Prioritization' (DyPr),
allocation method is also proposed for unseen services and the importance of
macro- and micro-level priority. We presented a zero-touch solution using Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for adaptive scheduling and an
online-Ridge Regression (RR) model for dynamic prioritization. The DDPG
successfully identified the 'Beneficial and Starving' services, efficiently
deploying twice as many low-priority services as others, reducing the
starvation problem. Our online-RR model learns the pattern in less than 100
transitions, and the prediction model has an accuracy rate of more than 80%.

and share their Point-of-Interest(PoI) information with each other in a common
cache to reduce query frequency and preserve location privacy. Yet most studies
on multi-user privacy preservation overlook the opportunity of leveraging their
service flexibility. This paper is the first to study multiple users' strategic
cooperation against an adversary's optimal inference attack, by leveraging
mutual service flexibility. We formulate the multi-user privacy cooperation
against the adversary as a max-min adversarial game and solve it in a linear
program. Unlike the vast literature, even if a user finds the cached
information useful, we prove it beneficial to still query the platform to
further confuse the adversary. As the linear program's computational complexity
still increases superlinearly with the number of users' possible locations, we
propose a binary obfuscation scheme in two opposite spatial directions to
achieve guaranteed performance with only constant complexity. Perhaps
surprisingly, a user with a greater service flexibility should query with a
less obfuscated location to add confusion. Finally, we provide guidance on the
optimal query sequence among LBS users. Simulation results show that our
crowdsourced privacy protection scheme greatly improves users' privacy as
compared with existing approaches.

categories of strong, rooted and weak, according to how their colors are

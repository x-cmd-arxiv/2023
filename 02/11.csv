models -- are an active research area of both theoretical and practical
significance. Most previously proposed parameter estimation algorithms
instantiate the EM algorithm, often with random initialization. However, such
an initialization scheme may not yield a good initial estimate and the
algorithms require multiple restarts, incurring a large time complexity. As for
the EM procedure, while the E-step can be performed efficiently, maximizing the
log-likelihood in the M-step is difficult due to the combinatorial nature of
the PL likelihood function (Gormley and Murphy 2008). Therefore, previous
authors favor algorithms that maximize surrogate likelihood functions (Zhao et
al. 2018, 2020). However, the final estimate may deviate from the true maximum
likelihood estimate as a consequence. In this paper, we address these known
limitations. We propose an initialization algorithm that can provide a provably
accurate initial estimate and an EM algorithm that maximizes the true
log-likelihood function efficiently. Experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets show that our algorithm is competitive in terms of accuracy and speed
to baseline algorithms, especially on datasets with a large number of items.

relative phase of the states in the superposition is observed. Perturbation
theory is used to disentangle the fundamental absorption processes and a rule

non-resonant transitions are the source of asymmetry in energy and phase, while
resonant transitions to the continuum contribute symmetrically to absorption of

and INTEGRAL/SPI, we studied the temporal and spectral evolution of MAXI
J1535-571 in the 2-500 keV range. Early spectra show a Comptonized spectrum and
a high-energy component dominant above ~150 keV. CompTT fits to the SPI data
found electron temperatures (kTe) evolves from ~31 keV to 18 keV with a tied
optical depth (tau ~ 0.85) or tau evolving from ~1.2-0.65 with a tied kTe (~24

spectral decomposition of the 100-400 keV energy band. The CompTT flux varies
significantly during the hard state while the high-energy component flux is
consistent with a constant flux. This result suggests that the two components
originate from different locations, which favors a jet origin interpretation

the class of sparse barycenters is characterized by a notion of best $n$-term
barycenter which we introduce, and which can be understood as a natural
extension of the classical concept of best $n$-term approximation in Banach

metamodelling of parametrized families of measures. We illustrate the potential
of the method through the specific problem of Model Order Reduction (MOR) of

reservoirs are impacted by strong environmental processing. We have selected
three among the most star-forming $z\sim0.4$ BCGs in the Kilo-Degree Survey

distant BCGs with detections in multiple CO transitions. The double-horn
emission for the KiDS 1433 BCG implies a low gas concentration, while a
modeling of the spectra yields an extended molecular gas reservoir, with a
characteristic radius of $\sim$(5-7) kpc, which is reminiscent of a mature
extended-disk phase observed in some local BCGs. For the other two BCGs we are
able to set upper limits of $M_{H_2}/M_\star<0.07$ and $<0.23$, which are among
the lowest for distant BCGs. We then combined our observations with available
stellar, SF, and dust properties of the targeted BCGs, and compared them with
$\sim100$ distant cluster galaxies, including additional intermediate-$z$ BCGs,
with observations in CO from the literature. The molecular gas properties of
star forming BCGs are heterogeneous. On one side, gas-rich BCGs show extended
gas reservoirs, which sustain the significant SF activity, which is reminiscent

qualities on public datasets but still generate some shadow remnants. One of
the reasons is the lack of large-scale shadow & shadow-free image pairs.
Unsupervised methods can alleviate the issue but their restoration qualities
are much lower than those of fully-supervised methods. In this work, we find
that pretraining shadow removal networks on the image inpainting dataset can
reduce the shadow remnants significantly: a naive encoder-decoder network gets
competitive restoration quality w.r.t. the state-of-the-art methods via only
10% shadow & shadow-free image pairs. After analyzing networks with/without
inpainting pre-training via the information stored in the weight (IIW), we find
that inpainting pretraining improves restoration quality in non-shadow regions
and enhances the generalization ability of networks significantly.
Additionally, shadow removal fine-tuning enables networks to fill in the
details of shadow regions. Inspired by these observations we formulate shadow
removal as an adaptive fusion task that takes advantage of both shadow removal
and image inpainting. Specifically, we develop an adaptive fusion network
consisting of two encoders, an adaptive fusion block, and a decoder. The two
encoders are responsible for extracting the feature from the shadow image and
the shadow-masked image respectively. The adaptive fusion block is responsible
for combining these features in an adaptive manner. Finally, the decoder
converts the adaptive fused features to the desired shadow-free result. The
extensive experiments show that our method empowered with inpainting
outperforms all state-of-the-art methods.

double emulsion as a model soft granular material to produce clusters of sizes
of 20-40 grains (droplets). We find that, optimally, the crystallites emerge
under weak flows, when the internal shear stresses slightly agitate the system
allowing internal rearrangements. Excessive flows destroy the delicate
crystalline structure and lead to constant internal recirculations, i.e.,
effective fluidization of the granular medium. Upon subjecting the clusters to
cycles of constriction and relaxation/expansion, we also find differences
between the behaviours of two groups of droplets: those within the inner part
of the cluster and those at its rim, with the latter subjected to larger
deformations and less frequent rearrangements, effectively acting as an elastic
solid-like membrane around the inner fluid-like core. This structural-dynamical
heterogeneity appears to be of purely topological origin and as such we expect
it to remain universal in various types of soft granular clusters or jets
including also cell aggregates, organoids or bioprinted tissues.

online algorithms that relaxes the ""radical worst-case"" perspective of classic
competitive analysis. In contrast to prior work, our method, referred to as
randomly infused advice (RIA), does not make any probabilistic assumptions
about the input sequence and does not rely on the development of designated
online algorithms. Rather, it can be applied to existing online randomized
algorithms, introducing a means to evaluate their performance in scenarios that
lie outside the radical worst-case regime. More concretely, an online algorithm
ALG with RIA benefits from pieces of advice generated by an omniscient but not
entirely reliable oracle. The crux of the new method is that the advice is
provided to ALG by writing it into the buffer B from which ALG normally reads
its random bits, hence allowing us to augment it through a very simple and
non-intrusive interface. The (un)reliability of the oracle is captured via a
parameter 0 {\le} {\alpha} {\le} 1 that determines the probability (per round)
that the advice is successfully infused by the oracle; if the advice is not
infused, which occurs with probability 1 - {\alpha}, then the buffer B contains
fresh random bits (as in the classic online setting).
  The applicability of the new RIA method is demonstrated by applying it to
three extensively studied online problems: paging, uniform metrical task
systems, and online set cover. For these problems, we establish new upper
bounds on the competitive ratio of classic online algorithms that improve as
the infusion parameter {\alpha} increases. These are complemented with (often
tight) lower bounds on the competitive ratio of online algorithms with RIA for
the three problems.

anthracene physisorbed on monolayer MoS$_2$, we assess the ability of different
\textit{ab initio} schemes to describe the electronic structure using
semi-local and hybrid DFT. For the latter, an unconstrained three-parameter
range-separation scheme is employed. Comparisons against many-body perturbation
theory results indicate that DFT is substantially unable to make reliable
predictions about interfacial properties. Hybrid functionals, while improving
the accuracy of the MoS$_2$ band structure, do not systematically enhance the
description of hybrid systems with respect to semi-local functionals. Neither
approach provides a good starting point for $G_0W_0$, which, consequently,
cannot provide much information beyond the correct energy level alignment. We
show that non-empirically parametrized electrostatic screening models can
accomplish the same task at negligible computational costs. Such schemes can
include substrates of hybrid interfaces in good agreement with experimental

relation of the input parameters of ionization front speed $U$, blackbody
temperature $T_{\rm bb}$, and neutral hydrogen density $n_{\rm HI}$, on
intensity $I$ and polarized intensity $P$ as seen by a distant observer. The

the Faraday and Kerr rotation angles for a single sheet of anisotropic Dirac
semimetal protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry in the presence of a
perpendicular magnetic field. While the magnetic field causes a rotation of the
plane of polarization of the light, the anisotropy causes the appearance of an
elliptically polarized component in an initially linearly polarized beam. The
two effects can be combined in a single complex Faraday rotation angle. At the
zero-frequency limit, we find a finite value of the Faraday rotation angle,
which is given by $2\alpha_F$, where $\alpha_F$ is the effective fine structure
constant associated with the velocity of the linearly dispersing Dirac
fermions. We also find a logarithmic enhancement of the Faraday (and Kerr)
rotation angles as the frequency of the light approaches the absorption edge
associated with the magnetic field-induced gap. While the enhancement is
reduced by impurity scattering, it remains significant for an attainable level
of material purity. These results indicate that two-dimensional Dirac materials
protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry are responsive to weak magnetic fields and
can be used as platforms for magneto-optic applications, such as the
realization of polarization-rotating devices.

latency and power consumption for on-device deployment of neural networks. In
many cases, a target bit-width is set for an entire network, meaning every
layer get quantized to the same number of bits. However, for many networks some
layers are significantly more robust to quantization noise than others, leaving
an important axis of improvement unused. As many hardware solutions provide
multiple different bit-width settings, mixed-precision quantization has emerged
as a promising solution to find a better performance-efficiency trade-off than
homogeneous quantization. However, most existing mixed precision algorithms are
rather difficult to use for practitioners as they require access to the
training data, have many hyper-parameters to tune or even depend on end-to-end
retraining of the entire model. In this work, we present a simple post-training
mixed precision algorithm that only requires a small unlabeled calibration
dataset to automatically select suitable bit-widths for each layer for
desirable on-device performance. Our algorithm requires no hyper-parameter

deployment constraints making it a great candidate for practical use. We
experimentally validate our proposed method on several computer vision tasks,

infrastructure are growing. CPS integrate sensing, computation, control and
networking into physical objects and mission-critical services, connecting

increases service efficiency, it has to face the possibility of new threats
posed by the new functionalities. This leads to cyber-threats, such as
denial-of-service, modification of data, information leakage, spreading of
malware, and many others. Cyber-resilience refers to the ability of a CPS to
prepare, absorb, recover, and adapt to the adverse effects associated with
cyber-threats, e.g., physical degradation of the CPS performance resulting from
a cyber-attack. Cyber-resilience aims at ensuring CPS survival, by keeping the
core functionalities of the CPS in case of extreme events. The literature on
cyber-resilience is rapidly increasing, leading to a broad variety of research
works addressing this new topic. In this article, we create a systematization
of knowledge about existing scientific efforts of making CPS cyber-resilient.
We systematically survey recent literature addressing cyber-resilience with a
focus on techniques that may be used on CPS. We first provide preliminaries and
background on CPS and threats, and subsequently survey state-of-the-art
approaches that have been proposed by recent research work applicable to CPS.
In particular, we aim at differentiating research work from traditional risk
management approaches, based on the general acceptance that it is unfeasible to
prevent and mitigate all possible risks threatening a CPS. We also discuss
questions and research challenges, with a focus on the practical aspects of
cyber-resilience, such as the use of metrics and evaluation methods, as well as

(IV) regressions. Recently, many flexible machine learning methods have been
developed for instrumental variable estimation. However, these methods have at
least one of the following limitations: (1) restricting the IV regression to be
uniquely identified; (2) only obtaining estimation error rates in terms of
pseudometrics (\emph{e.g.,} projected norm) rather than valid metrics
(\emph{e.g.,} $L_2$ norm); or (3) imposing the so-called closedness condition
that requires a certain conditional expectation operator to be sufficiently
smooth. In this paper, we present the first method and analysis that can avoid
all three limitations, while still permitting general function approximation.
Specifically, we propose a new penalized minimax estimator that can converge to
a fixed IV solution even when there are multiple solutions, and we derive a
strong $L_2$ error rate for our estimator under lax conditions. Notably, this
guarantee only needs a widely-used source condition and realizability
assumptions, but not the so-called closedness condition. We argue that the
source condition and the closedness condition are inherently conflicting, so
relaxing the latter significantly improves upon the existing literature that
requires both conditions. Our estimator can achieve this improvement because it

  https://semantic-web-journal.org/content/adversarial-transformer-language-models-contextual-commonsense-inference-1",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Contextualized or discourse aware commonsense inference is the task of
generating coherent commonsense assertions (i.e., facts) from a given story,
and a particular sentence from that story. Some problems with the task are:
lack of controllability for topics of the inferred facts; lack of commonsense
knowledge during training; and, possibly, hallucinated or false facts. In this
work, we utilize a transformer model for this task and develop techniques to
address the aforementioned problems in the task. We control the inference by
introducing a new technique we call ""hinting"". Hinting is a kind of language
model prompting, that utilizes both hard prompts (specific words) and soft
prompts (virtual learnable templates). This serves as a control signal to
advise the language model ""what to talk about"". Next, we establish a
methodology for performing joint inference with multiple commonsense knowledge
bases. Joint inference of commonsense requires care, because it is imprecise
and the level of generality is more flexible. You want to be sure that the
results ""still make sense"" for the context. To this end, we align the textual
version of assertions from three knowledge graphs (ConceptNet, ATOMIC2020, and
GLUCOSE) with a story and a target sentence. This combination allows us to
train a single model to perform joint inference with multiple knowledge graphs.
We show experimental results for the three knowledge graphs on joint inference.
Our final contribution is exploring a GAN architecture that generates the
contextualized commonsense assertions and scores them as to their plausibility
through a discriminator. The result is an integrated system for contextual
commonsense inference in stories, that can controllably generate plausible
commonsense assertions, and takes advantage of joint inference between multiple
commonsense knowledge bases.

speedup for convergence (i.e., the convergence rate and complexity are improved
linearly with respect to the number of sampled clients) in the presence of
non-i.i.d.~datasets, still remain open. In this paper, we fill these gaps by

investigate the so-called float-up process at high effective temperature,
whereby the upward diffusion of trace hydrogen leads to the formation of a
hydrogen atmosphere. We examine the dependence of this phenomenon on the
initial hydrogen abundance and on the strength of the radiative wind that
opposes gravitational settling. Combined with our empirical knowledge of
spectral evolution, our simulations provide new quantitative constraints on the
hydrogen content of the hot helium-dominated white dwarf population. Then, we
study the outcome of the so-called convective dilution process at low effective
temperature, whereby the superficial hydrogen layer is mixed within the
underlying helium-rich envelope. In stark contrast with previous works on
convective dilution, we demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions, our
models successfully reproduce the observed atmospheric composition of cool DBA
stars, thereby solving one of the most important problems of spectral evolution
theory. This major improvement is due to our self-consistent modeling of the
earlier float-up process, which predicts the existence of a massive hydrogen
reservoir underneath the thin superficial layer. We argue that the trace
hydrogen detected at the surface of DBA white dwarfs is, in most cases, of
primordial origin rather than the result of external accretion.

  White Matter Lesion Segmentation","5 pages, 5 figures, accepted at ISBI 2023",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The development of automatic segmentation techniques for medical imaging
tasks requires assessment metrics to fairly judge and rank such approaches on
benchmarks. The Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) is a popular choice for
comparing the agreement between the predicted segmentation against a
ground-truth mask. However, the DSC metric has been shown to be biased to the
occurrence rate of the positive class in the ground-truth, and hence should be
considered in combination with other metrics. This work describes a detailed
analysis of the recently proposed normalised Dice Similarity Coefficient (nDSC)
for binary segmentation tasks as an adaptation of DSC which scales the
precision at a fixed recall rate to tackle this bias. White matter lesion
segmentation on magnetic resonance images of multiple sclerosis patients is
selected as a case study task to empirically assess the suitability of nDSC. We
validate the normalised DSC using two different models across 59 subject scans
with a wide range of lesion loads. It is found that the nDSC is less biased
than DSC with lesion load on standard white matter lesion segmentation
benchmarks measured using standard rank correlation coefficients. An
implementation of nDSC is made available at:

impressive results, including the discovery of state-of-the-art machine
learning solutions, such as neural image classifiers. This is often done by
applying an evolutionary search method, which samples multiple candidate
solutions from a large space and evaluates the quality of each candidate
through a long training process. As a result, the search tends to be slow. In
this paper, we show that large efficiency gains can be obtained by employing a
fast unified functional hash, especially through the functional equivalence
caching technique, which we also present. The central idea is to detect by
hashing when the search method produces equivalent candidates, which occurs
very frequently, and this way avoid their costly re-evaluation. Our hash is
""functional"" in that it identifies equivalent candidates even if they were
represented or coded differently, and it is ""unified"" in that the same
algorithm can hash arbitrary representations; e.g. compute graphs, imperative
code, or lambda functions. As evidence, we show dramatic improvements on
multiple AutoML domains, including neural architecture search and algorithm
discovery. Finally, we consider the effect of hash collisions, evaluation
noise, and search distribution through empirical analysis. Altogether, we hope
this paper may serve as a guide to hashing techniques in AutoML.

proposed a deep CNN model, namely SeConvNet, to suppress SAP noise in

selective convolutional (SeConv) block. SeConvNet is compared to
state-of-the-art SAP denoising methods using extensive experiments on various

effectively restores images corrupted by SAP noise and surpasses all its

developed as a fast $C_{\ell}$ estimator on limited regions of the sky. This
method expresses the power spectrum of a masked map (""pseudo-$C_\ell$"") in
terms of the power spectrum of the unmasked map (the true $C_\ell$) and that of
the mask or weight map. However, it is often the case that the map and mask are
correlated in some way, such as point source masks used in cosmic microwave
background (CMB) analyses, which have nonzero correlation with CMB secondary
anisotropy fields and other mm-wave sky signals. In such situations, the MASTER
approach gives biased results, as it assumes that the unmasked map and mask
have zero correlation. While such effects have been discussed before with
regard to specific physical models, here we derive a completely general
formalism for any case where the map and mask are correlated. We show that our
result (""reMASTERed"") reconstructs ensemble-averaged pseudo-$C_\ell$ to
effectively exact precision, with significant improvements over traditional
estimators for cases where the map and mask are correlated. In particular, we
obtain an improvement in the mean absolute percent error from 30% with the
MASTER result to essentially no error with the reMASTERed result for an
integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) field map with a mask built from the thresholded
ISW field, and 10% to effectively zero for a Compton-$y$ map combined with an
infrared source mask (the latter being directly relevant to actual data
analysis). An important consequence of our result is that for maps with
correlated masks it is no longer possible to invert a simple equation to obtain
the true $C_\ell$ from the pseudo-$C_\ell$. Instead, our result necessitates
the use of forward modeling from theory space into the observable domain of the
pseudo-$C_\ell$. Our code is publicly available at

of them remain useful after distribution shift. Pro$^2$ then learns a linear
classifier on top of these projected features using a small target dataset.
Theoretically, we find that Pro$^2$ results in more sample-efficient
generalization by inducing a favorable bias-variance tradeoff. Our experiments
on four datasets, with multiple distribution shift settings for each, show that
Pro$^2$ improves performance by 5-15% when given limited target data compared

While previous research has analyzed the virality across true and false social
media posts, not every misleading post is necessarily equally viral. Rather,
misinformation has different characteristics and varies in terms of its
believability and harmfulness - which might influence its spread. In this work,
we study how the perceived believability and harmfulness of misleading posts
are associated with their virality on social media. Specifically, we analyze
(and validate) a large sample of crowd-annotated social media posts from
Twitter's Birdwatch platform, on which users can rate the believability and
harmfulness of misleading tweets. To address our research questions, we
implement an explanatory regression model and link the crowd ratings for
believability and harmfulness to the virality of misleading posts on Twitter.
Our findings imply that misinformation that is (i) easily believable and (ii)
not particularly harmful is associated with more viral resharing cascades.
These results offer insights into how different kinds of crowd fact-checked
misinformation spreads and suggest that the most viral misleading posts are
often not the ones that are particularly concerning from the perspective of
public safety. From a practical view, our findings may help platforms to
develop more effective strategies to curb the proliferation of misleading posts

X-Shooter spectrograph. In this paper, we focus on the line-of-sight velocity
distribution, measuring integrated stellar velocity dispersions from the
spectra, and assessing their robustness and the associated uncertainties. For
each of the 21 new systems, we systematically investigated the effect of the
parameters and set-ups of the full spectral fitting on the stellar velocity
dispersion ($\sigma$) measurements. In particular, we tested how $\sigma$
changes when several parameters of the fit as well as the resolution and
spectral coverage of the input spectra are varied. We found that the effect
that causes the largest systematic uncertainties on $\sigma$ is the wavelength
range used for the fit, especially for spectra with a lower signal-to-noise
ratio (S/N $\leq$ 30). When using blue wavelengths (UVB arm) one generally
underestimates the velocity dispersion (by $\sim$15 km/s). The values obtained
from the near-IR (NIR) arm present a larger scatter because the quality of the
spectra is lower. We finally compared our results with those in literature,
finding a very good agreement overall. Joining results obtained in DR1 with
those presented here, INSPIRE contains 40 ultra-compact massive galaxies,
corresponding to 75% of the whole survey. By plotting these systems in a
stellar mass-velocity dispersion diagram, we identify at least four highly
reliable relic candidates among the new systems. Their velocity dispersion is
larger than that of normal-sized galaxies of similar stellar mass.

their well-defined period-luminosity relations (PLRs) at infrared wavelengths.
We present results of near-infrared (NIR) monitoring of Galactic globular
clusters to empirically quantify the metallicity dependence of NIR PLRs for RR
Lyrae variables. Our sample includes homogeneous, accurate, and precise
photometric data for 964 RR Lyrae variables in 11 globular clusters covering a
large metallicity range ($\Delta\textrm{[Fe/H]}\sim2$~dex). We derive $JHK_s$
band period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) and period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ)
relations anchored using 346 Milky Way field RR Lyrae stars with {\it Gaia}
parallaxes, and simultaneously solved for independent distances to globular
clusters. We find a significant metallicity dependence of $\sim0.2$~mag/dex in
$JHK_s$ band PLZ and PWZ relations for RR Lyrae stars independent of the
adopted metallicity scale. The metallicity coefficients and the zero-points of
the empirical PLZ and PWZ relations are in excellent agreement with the
predictions from the horizontal branch evolution and pulsation models.
Furthermore, RR Lyrae based distances to our sample of globular clusters are
also statistically consistent with other independent measurements in the
literature. Our recommended empirical $JHK_s$ band PLZ relations are also
provided for RR Lyrae based distance measurements.

violation can have large consequences, modifying the sensitivity of existing

Previous works in the literature have focused on the zero-momentum limit which
has its limitations when extending analysing the Non-Relativistic Effective
Field Theory basis (NREFT). In this paper, we study isospin violation in a
detailed manner, paying specific attention to the experimental setups of liquid
noble detectors. We analyse two effective Standard Model gauge invariant models
as interesting case studies as well as the more model-independent NREFT
operators. This work demonstrates the high degree of complementarity between
the target nuclei xenon and argon. Most notably, we show that the Standard
Model gauge-invariant formulation of the standard spin-dependent interaction
often generates a sizeable response from argon, a target nuclei with zero spin.
This work is meant as an update and a useful reference to model builders and
experimentalists.

preparation in which the use of auxiliary counterdiabatic controls circumvents
the requirement of slow driving in adiabatic strategies. While their
development is well established in simple systems, their engineering and
implementation are challenging in many-body quantum systems with many degrees
of freedom. We show that the equation for the counterdiabatic term,
equivalently the adiabatic gauge potential, is solved by introducing a Krylov
basis. The Krylov basis spans the minimal operator subspace in which the
dynamics unfolds and provides an efficient way to construct the counterdiabatic
term. We apply our strategy to paradigmatic single and many-particle models.
The properties of the counterdiabatic term are reflected in the Lanczos
coefficients obtained in the course of the construction of the Krylov basis by
an algorithmic method. We examine how the expansion in the Krylov basis
incorporates many-body interactions in the counterdiabatic term.

However, there are at present no thoroughly developed models for this type of

excitations of a relativistic quantum field, and with the measurements modeled
using expectation values of field observables. Here we propose a thought
experiment where two particles (i.e., massive scalar field quanta) are
initially prepared in a superposition of coherent states within a common
three-dimensional (3D) harmonic trap. The particles then develop entanglement
through their mutual gravitational interaction, which can be probed through
particle position detection probabilities. The present work gives a
non-relativistic quantum mechanical analysis of the gravitationally induced
entanglement of this system, which we term the `gravitational harmonium' due to
its similarity to the harmonium model of approximate electron interactions in a
helium atom; the entanglement is operationally determined through the matter
wave interference visibility. The present work serves as the basis for a
subsequent investigation, which models this system using quantum field theory,
providing further insights into the quantum nature of gravitationally induced

procedure to quantify the entanglement.

is divided between strongly and weakly barred galaxies identified via Galaxy
Zoo, is the largest that this method has been applied to. We find lower pattern
speeds for strongly barred galaxies than for weakly barred galaxies. As
simulations show that the pattern speed decreases as the bar exchanges angular
momentum with its host, these results suggest that strong bars are more evolved
than weak bars. Interestingly, the corotation radius is not different between
weakly and strongly barred galaxies, despite being proportional to bar length.
We also find that the corotation radius is significantly different between
quenching and star forming galaxies. Additionally, we find that strongly barred
galaxies have significantly lower values for R, the ratio between the
corotation radius and the bar radius, than weakly barred galaxies, despite a
big overlap in both distributions. This ratio classifies bars into ultrafast
bars (R < 1.0; 11% of our sample), fast bars (1.0 < R < 1.4; 27%) and slow bars
(R > 1.4; 62%). Simulations show that R is correlated with the bar formation
mechanism, so our results suggest that strong bars are more likely to be formed
by different mechanisms than weak bars. Finally, we find a lower fraction of
ultrafast bars than most other studies, which decreases the recently claimed
tension with {\Lambda}CDM. However, the median value of R is still lower than
what is predicted by simulations.

properties for 23 highly secure host galaxies of fast radio bursts (FRBs). Our

Using stellar population synthesis modeling and employing non-parametric star
formation histories (SFHs), we find that FRB hosts have a median stellar mass
of $\approx 10^{9.9}\,M_{\odot}$, mass-weighted age $\approx 5.1$ Gyr, and
ongoing star formation rate $\approx 1.3\,M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ but span wide
ranges in all properties. Classifying the hosts by degree of star formation, we
find that 87% (20/23 hosts) are star-forming, two are transitioning, and one is
quiescent. The majority trace the star-forming main sequence of galaxies, but
at least three FRBs in our sample originate in less active environments (two
non-repeaters and one repeater). Across all modeled properties, we find no
statistically significant distinction between the hosts of repeaters and
non-repeaters. However, the hosts of repeating FRBs generally extend to lower
stellar masses, and the hosts of non-repeaters arise in more optically luminous
galaxies. While four of the galaxies with the most clear and prolonged rises in
their SFHs all host repeating FRBs, demonstrating heightened star formation
activity in the last $\lesssim 100$ Myr, one non-repeating host shows this SFH
as well. Our results support progenitor models with short delay channels (i.e.,
magnetars formed via core-collapse supernova) for most FRBs, but the presence
of some FRBs in less active environments suggests a fraction form through more
delayed channels.

helium in the solid state and is an indispensable component both in theory and
observations of galaxy evolution. Dust emission is generally the primary
coolant of the interstellar medium (ISM) and facilitates the gravitational
collapse and fragmentation of gas clouds from which stars form, while altering
the emission spectrum of galaxies from ultraviolet (UV) to far-infrared
wavelengths through the reprocessing of starlight. However, the astrophysical
origin of various types of dust grains remains an open question, especially in
the early Universe. Here we report direct evidence for the presence of
carbonaceous grains from the detection of the broad UV absorption feature
around $2175 \, \mathring{\rm A}$ in deep near-infrared spectra of galaxies up
to the first billion years of cosmic time, at a redshift ($z$) of $\sim 7$.
This dust attenuation feature has previously only been observed
spectroscopically in older, more evolved galaxies at redshifts of $z < 3$. The
carbonaceous grains giving rise to this feature are often thought to be
produced on timescales of hundreds of millions of years by asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars. Our results suggest a more rapid production scenario,
likely in supernova (SN) ejecta.

dimensions along which dark matter particles have undergone shell-crossing
(crossing number) in $N$-body simulations from the AbacusSummit simulation
suite, we identify dark matter particles which have undergone no shell crossing
as belonging to voids. We then find voids in the corresponding halo
distribution using two different void-finding algorithms: VoidFinder and V$^2$,
a ZOBOV-based algorithm. The resulting void catalogs are compared to the
distribution of dark matter particles to examine how their crossing numbers
depend on void proximity. While both algorithms' voids have a similar
distribution of crossing numbers near their centers, we find that beyond 0.25
times the effective void radius, voids found by VoidFinder exhibit a stronger
preference for particles with low crossing numbers than those found by V$^2$.
We examine two possible methods of mitigating this difference in efficacy
between the algorithms. While we are able to partially mitigate the
ineffectiveness of V$^2$ by using distance from the void edge as a measure of
centrality, we conclude that VoidFinder more reliably identifies
dynamically-distinct regions of low crossing number.

multi-dimensional measurements of kinematics, abundances, and ages for a large
population of stars. Ages for luminous giants, which can be seen to large
distances, are an essential component of studies of the Milky Way, but they are
traditionally very difficult to estimate precisely for a large dataset and
often require careful analysis on a star-by-star basis in asteroseismology.
Because spectra are easier to obtain for large samples, being able to determine
precise ages from spectra allows for large age samples to be constructed, but
spectroscopic ages are often imprecise and contaminated by abundance
correlations. Here we present an application of a variational encoder-decoder
on cross-domain astronomical data to solve these issues. The model is trained
on pairs of observations from APOGEE and Kepler of the same star in order to
reduce the dimensionality of the APOGEE spectra in a latent space while
removing abundance information. The low dimensional latent representation of
these spectra can then be trained to predict age with just $\sim$ 1,000 precise
seismic ages. We demonstrate that this model produces more precise
spectroscopic ages ($\sim$ 22% overall, $\sim$ 11% for red-clump stars) than
previous data-driven spectroscopic ages while being less contaminated by
abundance information (in particular, our ages do not depend on [$\alpha$/M]).
We create a public age catalog for the APOGEE DR17 data set and use it to map
the age distribution and the age-[Fe/H]-[$\alpha$/M] distribution across the
radial range of the Galactic disk.

Unfortunately, formula graphs are often large and complex such that querying

graphs using these patterns, directly querying the compressed graph without
decompression, and incrementally maintaining the graph during updates. We
integrate TACO into an open-source spreadsheet system and show that TACO can

warm-start technique used in conventional solvers to address one of the major
challenges faced by decision diagram based methods. Decision diagrams become
more useful the wider they are allowed to be, but also become more costly to
generate, especially with large numbers of variables. In the original version

constructed diagrams and using it as the initial diagram for subsequent
iterations that we call peel-and-bound. We tested the method on the sequence
ordering problem, and our results indicate that our peel-and-bound scheme
generates stronger bounds than a branch-and-bound scheme using the same
propagators, and at significantly less computational cost. In this extended
version of the paper, we also propose new methods for using relaxed decision
diagrams to improve the solutions found using restricted decision diagrams,
discuss the heuristic decisions involved with the parallelization of
peel-and-bound, and discuss how peel-and-bound can be hyper-optimized for
sequencing problems. Furthermore, we test the new methods on the sequence
ordering problem and the traveling salesman problem with time-windows (TSPTW),

peel-and-bound outperforms ddo (a decision diagram based branch-and-bound

the Transformer-based models, being the key element for many state-of-the-art
models that have been developed through recent years. However, one of the
biggest obstacles in implementing these architectures - as well as many others
in Deep Learning Field - is the enormous amount of optimizing parameters they
possess, which make its use conditioned on the availability of robust hardware.
In this paper, it's proposed a new method of attention mechanism that adapts
the Dot-Product Attention, which uses matrices multiplications, to become
element-wise through the use of arrays multiplications. To test the
effectiveness of such approach, two models (one with a VGG-like architecture
and one with the proposed method) have been trained in a classification task
using Fashion MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Each model has been trained for 10
epochs in a single Tesla T4 GPU from Google Colaboratory. The results show that
this mechanism allows for an accuracy of 92% of the VGG-like counterpart in
Fashion MNIST dataset, while reducing the number of parameters in 97%. For
CIFAR10, the accuracy is still equivalent to 60% of the VGG-like counterpart
while using 50% less parameters.

new transmission infrastructure to relieve congestion in the system.
Consequently, there has been a rapid growth in the number of RAS in electric

hence cannot adapt to the rapidly evolving nature of the electric grid. In this
paper, an optimization framework (RAS-SCOPF) to automate the RAS design
procedure is proposed. The proposed framework is a mixed integer quadratic
program (MIQP) that chooses a set of optimal RAS actions and minimizes load
shed when a contingency occurs. The cost of operation of the RAS-SCOPF is
compared against those of standard OPF and SCOPF formulations. Moreover, the
risk of cascading failure for the different formulations are evaluated using a
DC power flow based cascading failure simulator (CFS). The proposed framework
is applied to the RTS-96 24-bus network. The inclusion of RAS allows the system
to be operated at a lower cost while preventing any contingency from evolving
into cascading blackouts.

effective application of UCCD to real-world dynamic systems requires a thorough
understanding of uncertainties and how their impact can be captured. Since the
first step is defining the UCCD problem of interest, this article aims at
addressing some of the limitations of the current literature by identifying
possible sources of uncertainties in a general UCCD context and then
formalizing ways in which their impact is captured through problem formulation
alone (without having to immediately resort to specific solution strategies).
We first develop and then discuss a generalized UCCD formulation that can
capture uncertainty representations presented in this article. Issues such as
the treatment of the objective function, the challenge of the analysis-type
equality constraints, and various formulations for inequality constraints are
discussed. Then, more specialized problem formulations such as stochastic in

robust, fuzzy expected value, and possibilistic chance-constrained UCCD

insights from closely-related fields, such as robust and stochastic control

possibility of estimating the appropriate pavement patching strategy
(i.e.,patching location,depth,and quantity) by integrating pavement structural
and surface condition assessment with pavement specific ratings of
distress.Especially,it combines pavement structural condition assessment
parameter;falling weight deflectometer deflections along with surface condition
assessment parameters;international roughness index,and cracking density for a
better representation of overall pavement distress condition.Then,a pavement
specific threshold-based patching suggestion algorithm is implemented to
evaluate the pavement overall distress condition into a priority-based patching

its data-driven ability to determine threshold values from current road
condition measurements using a reliability concept validated by the theoretical

manager tool (PMT) was implemented to automate the patching suggestion

minority classes and reduce the influence of majority classes on the output of
models. However, the extracted representations may be of poor quality owing to
the limited number of minority samples. To handle this restriction, several

is no reliable way to quantitatively assess the degree of IRI present in the

presumably due to IRI-induced decrease in the activity of the hepatic multidrug
resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2); however, the contribution of SF blood
clearance via the bile is still convoluted with other factors, such as renal
clearance. In this work, we sought to computationally model SF blood clearance
via the bile. First, we converted extant SF fluorescence data from rat whole
blood, plasma, and bile to concentrations using calibration curves. Next, based
on these SF concentration data, we generated a liver-centric,
physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of SF liver uptake and
clearance via the bile. Model simulations show that SF bile concentration is
highly sensitive to a change in the activity of hepatic MPR2. These simulations
suggest that SF bile clearance along with the PBPK model can be used to
quantify the effect of IRI on the activity of MRP2.

problems in causal inference. However, most estimation methods rely on the
strong assumption that all confounders are observed, which is impractical and
untestable in the real world. We develop a mediation analysis framework
inferring the latent confounder for debiasing both direct and indirect causal
effects. Specifically, we introduce generalized structural equation modeling
that incorporates structured latent factors to improve the goodness-of-fit of
the model to observed data, and deconfound the mediators and outcome
simultaneously. One major advantage of the proposed framework is that it
utilizes the causal pathway structure from cause to outcome via multiple
mediators to debias the causal effect without requiring external information on
latent confounders. In addition, the proposed framework is flexible in terms of
integrating powerful nonparametric prediction algorithms while retaining
interpretable mediation effects. In theory, we establish the identification of
both causal and mediation effects based on the proposed deconfounding method.
Numerical experiments on both simulation settings and a normative aging study
indicate that the proposed approach reduces the estimation bias of both causal

specificity of heat conduction at low temperatures: graphene fillers can serve
as, both, the scattering centers for phonons in the matrix material and as the
conduits of heat. We offer a physical model that explains the experimental
trends by the increasing effect of the thermal boundary resistance at cryogenic

called the ""Optimal Value Dominance"" for our objective. Under this condition,
we propose novel online learning algorithms such that, for the high-tier task,
it can achieve constant regret on partial states depending on the task
similarity and retain near-optimal regret when the two tasks are dissimilar,
while for the low-tier task, it can keep near-optimal without making sacrifice.
Moreover, we further study the setting with multiple low-tier tasks, and
propose a novel transfer source selection mechanism, which can ensemble the
information from all low-tier tasks and allow provable benefits on a much
larger state-action space.

milestone for students. These courses allow students to create a software
solution and demonstrate the knowledge they accumulated in their degrees.
However, a typical capstone project team is small containing no more than 5
students and function independently from other teams. To better reflect
real-world software development and meet industry demands, we introduce in this
paper our novel capstone course. Each student was assigned to a large-scale,
multi-team (i.e., company) of up to 20 students to collaboratively build
software. Students placed in a company gained first-hand experiences with
respect to multi-team coordination, integration, communication, agile, and
teamwork to build a microservices based project. Furthermore, each company was
required to implement plug-and-play so that their services would be compatible
with another company, thereby sharing common APIs. Through developing the
product in autonomous sub-teams, the students enhanced not only their technical
abilities but also their soft skills such as communication and coordination.
More importantly, experiencing the challenges that arose from the multi-team
project trained students to realize the pitfalls and advantages of
organizational culture. Among many lessons learned from this course experience,
students learned the critical importance of building team trust. We provide
detailed information about our course structure, lessons learned, and propose
recommendations for other universities and programs. Our work concerns
educators interested in launching similar capstone projects so that students in
other institutions can reap the benefits of large-scale, multi-team development

of BH-cluster and BH-average-star mass ratios, unrestricted by the
computational constraints affecting direct N-body codes. We use either single
mass models or models with a Salpeter mass function, with the IMBH initially
sitting at the centre. The force exerted by and on the IMBH is evaluated with a
direct scheme. We measure the evolution of the Lagrangian radii and core
density and velocity dispersion over time. In addition, we study the evolution
of the velocity anisotropy profiles. We find that models with an IMBH undergo
core collapse at earlier times, the larger the IMBH mass the shallower, with an
approximately constant central density at core collapse. The presence of an
IMBH tends to lower the central velocity dispersion. These results hold
independently of the mass function. For the models with Salpeter MF we observe
that equipartition of kinetic energies is never achieved. Orbital anisotropy at
large radii appears driven by energetic escapers on radial orbits. We measure
the wander radius. Among the results we obtained, which mostly confirm or
extend previously known trends that had been established over the range of

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CR cs.IT cs.LG math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel form of inference attack in vertical federated learning (VFL) is
proposed, where two parties collaborate in training a machine learning (ML)
model. Logistic regression is considered for the VFL model. One party, referred
to as the active party, possesses the ground truth labels of the samples in the
training phase, while the other, referred to as the passive party, only shares
a separate set of features corresponding to these samples. It is shown that the
active party can carry out inference attacks on both training and prediction
phase samples by acquiring an ML model independently trained on the training
samples available to them. This type of inference attack does not require the
active party to be aware of the score of a specific sample, hence it is
referred to as an agnostic inference attack. It is shown that utilizing the
observed confidence scores during the prediction phase, before the time of the
attack, can improve the performance of the active party's autonomous model, and
thus improve the quality of the agnostic inference attack. As a countermeasure,
privacy-preserving schemes (PPSs) are proposed. While the proposed schemes
preserve the utility of the VFL model, they systematically distort the VFL
parameters corresponding to the passive party's features. The level of the
distortion imposed on the passive party's parameters is adjustable, giving rise
to a trade-off between privacy of the passive party and interpretabiliy of the
VFL outcomes by the active party. The distortion level of the passive party's
parameters could be chosen carefully according to the privacy and
interpretabiliy concerns of the passive and active parties, respectively, with
the hope of keeping both parties (partially) satisfied. Finally, experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attack and the PPSs.

photovoltaics and as a quality control for reproducibly obtaining high
conversion efficiencies in commercial solar cell modules. Presently, no
technique capable of such an endeavor is available to the best of our
knowledge. Here, we introduce a novel method capable of profiling the carrier
mobility along the z-axis in thin-film photovoltaics. Our setup is based on the
integration of photogenerated charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage
(p-CELIV) with a scanning confocal optical microscope (SCOM) towards a
cross-sectional sensitive p-CELIV (cs-p-CELIV) system. As geminate
recombination of excess carriers is the most frequent radiative pathway for
electrons and holes in solar cells at low power density of illumination, while
nongeminate recombination dominates at high power, enhanced nongeminate
recombination occurs at the SCOM focal plane. Thus, the cs-p-CELIV signal
provides enhanced information on the mobility of all of the cross-sectional
layers, except for the focal plane. By scanning the focal plane along the
z-axis, the mobility profile can be derived. To demonstrate our technique, we
use it to investigate the carrier mobility in a hydrogenated amorphous silicon
(a-Si:H) solar cell. The mobility profile obtained by cs-p-CELIV correlates
well with the H content profile, measured independently, and is in excellent
agreement with models suggesting a critical role of Si-H bonding in locally
determining the carrier mobility in a-Si:H.

for estimating causal effects in observational studies. These methods reduce

larger sample size, both bias and variance in the causal effect estimation are

especially challenging as the summarization should be not only effective in

stream Summarization (EMDS), and introduce a novel unsupervised algorithm PDSum

lightweight prototype of each multi-document set and exploits it to adapt to
new documents while preserving accumulated knowledge from previous documents.
To update new summaries, the most representative sentences for each
multi-document set are extracted by measuring their similarities to the
prototypes. A thorough evaluation with real multi-document sets streams
demonstrates that PDSum outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
multi-document summarization algorithms in EMDS in terms of relevance, novelty,

purpose of evaluating its effectiveness in helping students with respect to
improving software quality. This paper discusses the results of an experiment
in the classroom over a period of 3 academic semesters, involving 65
submissions that carried out code review activity of 690 rules using PMD. The
results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that the presence of
a set of PMD quality issues influence the acceptance or rejection of the
issues, design, and best practices-related categories that take a longer time
to be resolved, and students acknowledge the potential of using static analysis
tools during code review. Through this experiment, code review can turn into a
vital part of the educational computing plan. We envision our findings enabling
educators to support students with code review strategies to raise students
awareness about static analysis tools and scaffolding their coding skills.

mean squared higher-order difference of clock reading deviation. The main
results of this paper are threefold. First, we prove that the higher-order
difference operation of clock reading deviation, which can be interpreted as a
linear aggregation with binomial coefficients, is not only sufficient, but also
necessary for a resultant aggregated time series to be an independent and

potentials for high-quality 3D shape generation. However, most existing work
based on diffusion models only focus on geometric shape generation, they cannot
either accomplish 3D reconstruction from a single image, or produce 3D
geometric shape with color information. In this work, we propose to reconstruct
a 3D colored shape from a single RGB image through a novel conditional
diffusion model. The reverse process of the proposed diffusion model is
consisted of three modules, shape prediction module, color prediction module
and NeRF-like rendering module. In shape prediction module, the reference RGB
image is first encoded into a high-level shape feature and then the shape
feature is utilized as a condition to predict the reverse geometric noise in
diffusion model. Then the color of each 3D point updated in shape prediction
module is predicted by color prediction module. Finally, a NeRF-like rendering
module is designed to render the colored point cloud predicted by the former
two modules to 2D image space to guide the training conditioned only on a
reference image. As far as the authors know, the proposed method is the first
diffusion model for 3D colored shape reconstruction from a single RGB image.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive
performance on colored 3D shape reconstruction, and the ablation study
validates the positive role of the color prediction module in improving the
reconstruction quality of 3D geometric point cloud.

show that: (1) structured decompositions (a recent, abstract generalization of
many graph decompositions) define Grothendieck topologies on categories of data
(adhesive categories) and that (2) any computational problem which can be
represented as a sheaf with respect to these topologies can be decided in
linear time on classes of inputs which admit decompositions of bounded width

immediately leads to algorithms on objects of any C-set category; these include

algebraic language, it gives extensions of endomorphism of $N$ to $M$ arising
from a subfactor $N\subset M$ of finite index and finite depth giving a braided

Ocneanu's graphical calculus. We study this $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary
connections, which give a characterization of finite-dimensional nondegenerate
commuting squares and gives certain 4-tensors appearing in recent studies of
2-dimensional topological order. We show that the resulting $\alpha$-induced
bi-unitary connections are flat if we have a commutative Frobenius algebra, or
a local Q-system. Examples related to chiral conformal field theory and the

(ASR) techniques in various domains. Consequently, evaluating and enhancing the
quality of ASR systems is of great importance. This paper proposes ASDF, an
Automated Speech Recognition Differential Testing Framework for testing ASR
systems. ASDF extends an existing ASR testing tool, the CrossASR++, which
synthesizes test cases from a text corpus. However, CrossASR++ fails to make
use of the text corpus efficiently and provides limited information on how the
failed test cases can improve ASR systems. To address these limitations, our
tool incorporates two novel features: (1) a text transformation module to boost
the number of generated test cases and uncover more errors in ASR systems and
(2) a phonetic analysis module to identify on which phonemes the ASR system
tend to produce errors. ASDF generates more high-quality test cases by applying
various text transformation methods (e.g., change tense) to the texts in failed
test cases. By doing so, ASDF can utilize a small text corpus to generate a
large number of audio test cases, something which CrossASR++ is not capable of.
In addition, ASDF implements more metrics to evaluate the performance of ASR
systems from multiple perspectives. ASDF performs phonetic analysis on the
identified failed test cases to identify the phonemes that ASR systems tend to
transcribe incorrectly, providing useful information for developers to improve
ASR systems. The demonstration video of our tool is made online at

low energy physics goes beyond conventional paradigm of 2D homogeneous bosons,
i.e., intralayer excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. With
intrinsic valley-orbit coupling and external magnetic field, exciton dispersion
becomes linear at small momentum, giving rise to a series of novel features.
The critical temperature of Bose-Einstein condensation of these excitons is
nonzero, suggesting true long-range order in 2D homogeneous system. The
dispersion of Goldstone mode at long wavelength has the form
$\varepsilon(\boldsymbol{q})\sim\sqrt{q}$, in contrast to conventional linear
phonon spectrum. The vortex energy deviates from the usual logarithmic form
with respect to system size, but instead has an additional linear term.
Superfluid to normal phase transition is no longer BKT type for system size

density. With the recent experimental progress towards realization of exciton
condensate in monolayer semiconductors, our work provides an experimentally
feasible system to search for unconventional 2D superfluids beyond BKT

methods. In this work we develop a new method for CME arrival time prediction
that uses magnetohydrodynamic simulations involving data-constrained
flux-rope-based CMEs, which are introduced in a data-driven solar wind
background. We found that, for 6 CMEs studied in this work, the MAE in arrival
time was ~8 hours. We further improved our arrival time predictions by using
ensemble modeling and comparing the ensemble solutions with STEREO-A&B
heliospheric imager data. This was done by using our simulations to create
synthetic J-maps. A machine learning (ML) method called the lasso regression
was used for this comparison. Using this approach, we could reduce the MAE to
~4 hours. Another ML method based on the neural networks (NNs) made it possible
to reduce the MAE to ~5 hours for the cases when HI data from both STEREO-A&B
were available. NNs are capable of providing similar MAE when only the STEREO-A
data is used. Our methods also resulted in very encouraging values of standard

important role in diagnostic radiology. To overcome the practical issues in
manual approaches, there is a huge demand for building automatic tumor
segmentation algorithms. This work introduces an efficient brain tumor
summation model by exploiting the advancement in MRI and graph neural networks
(GNNs). The model represents the volumetric MRI as a region adjacency graph
(RAG) and learns to identify the type of tumors through a graph attention
network (GAT) -- a variant of GNNs. The ablation analysis conducted on two
benchmark datasets proves that the proposed model can produce competitive
results compared to the leading-edge solutions. It achieves mean dice scores of
0.91, 0.86, 0.79, and mean Hausdorff distances in the 95th percentile (HD95) of
5.91, 6.08, and 9.52 mm, respectively, for whole tumor, core tumor, and
enhancing tumor segmentation on BraTS2021 validation dataset. On average, these
performances are >6\% and >50%, compared to a GNN-based baseline model,

paradigm, but is often limited by significant communication costs and edge
device computation capabilities. Federated Split Learning (FSL) preserves the
parallel model training principle of FL, with a reduced device computation
requirement thanks to splitting the ML model between the server and clients.
However, FSL still incurs very high communication overhead due to transmitting
the smashed data and gradients between the clients and the server in each
global round. Furthermore, the server has to maintain separate models for every
client, resulting in a significant computation and storage requirement that
grows linearly with the number of clients. This paper tries to solve these two
issues by proposing a communication and storage efficient federated and split
learning (CSE-FSL) strategy, which utilizes an auxiliary network to locally
update the client models while keeping only a single model at the server, hence
avoiding the communication of gradients from the server and greatly reducing
the server resource requirement. Communication cost is further reduced by only
sending the smashed data in selected epochs from the clients. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of CSE-FSL that guarantees its convergence for
non-convex loss functions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
CSE-FSL has a significant communication reduction over existing FSL techniques
while achieving state-of-the-art convergence and model accuracy, using several
real-world FL tasks.

order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation
and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant
weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a
comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed
with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a
quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during
each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In
this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility
of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive
Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis
that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is
being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility
reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting.
Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant
deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with
proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning
algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both
compression efficiency and robustness.

practically important case of $D=3$, the incoherence of the model is rigorously
proved to be stable for negative coupling $(K<0)$ but unstable for positive

the onset of amplitude death is theoretically predicted. For $D\geq2$, the
discrete and continuous spectra for both locked states and amplitude death are
governed by two general formulas. Our proposed $D$-dimensional model is
physically more reasonable, because it is no longer constrained by fixed
amplitude dynamics, which puts the recent studies of the $D$-dimensional
Kuramoto phase model on a stronger footing by providing a more general

finite-horizon trajectory. The uncertain system is modeled as a connection of a
nonlinear system and a perturbation. The analysis relies on three ingredients.
First, the nonlinear system is approximated by a linear time-varying (LTV)
system via linearization along a trajectory. This linearization introduces an
additional forcing input due to the nominal trajectory. Second, the
input/output behavior of the perturbation is described by time-domain, integral
quadratic constraints (IQCs). Third, a dissipation inequality is formulated to
bound the worst-case deviation of an output signal due to the uncertainty.
These steps yield a differential linear matrix inequality (DLMI) condition to
bound the worst-case performance. The robustness condition is then converted to
an equivalent condition in terms of a Riccati Differential Equation. This
yields a computational method that avoids heuristics often used to solve DLMIs,
e.g. time gridding. The approach is demonstrated by a two-link robotic arm
example.

transitions simultaneously under the collective strong coupling condition and
produce three polariton eigenstates which can be tuned freely by varying system
parameters. The output field intensities of multiple channels are zero when the

methodology is built upon widely adopted multivariate functional principal
component analysis to reduce the dimension of the infinite-dimensional

for diverse NLP tasks. In particular, automatic methods that generate discrete
prompts from a small set of training instances have reported superior
performance. However, a closer look at the learnt prompts reveals that they
contain noisy and counter-intuitive lexical constructs that would not be
encountered in manually-written prompts. This raises an important yet
understudied question regarding the robustness of automatically learnt discrete
prompts when used in downstream tasks. To address this question, we conduct a
systematic study of the robustness of discrete prompts by applying carefully
designed perturbations into an application using AutoPrompt and then measure
their performance in two Natural Language Inference (NLI) datasets. Our
experimental results show that although the discrete prompt-based method
remains relatively robust against perturbations to NLI inputs, they are highly
sensitive to other types of perturbations such as shuffling and deletion of
prompt tokens. Moreover, they generalize poorly across different NLI datasets.
We hope our findings will inspire future work on robust discrete prompt

investigate the dynamic regret of online Frank-Wolfe (OFW), which is an
efficient projection-free algorithm for online convex optimization. It is
well-known that in the setting of offline optimization, the smoothness of
functions and the strong convexity of functions accompanying specific
properties of constraint sets can be utilized to achieve fast convergence rates
for the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. However, for OFW, previous studies only
establish a dynamic regret bound of $O(\sqrt{T}(1+V_T+\sqrt{D_T}))$ by
utilizing the convexity of problems, where $T$ is the number of rounds, $V_T$
is the function variation, and $D_T$ is the gradient variation. In this paper,
we derive improved dynamic regret bounds for OFW by extending the fast
convergence rates of FW from offline optimization to online optimization. The
key technique for this extension is to set the step size of OFW with a line
search rule. In this way, we first show that the dynamic regret bound of OFW
can be improved to $O(\sqrt{T(1+V_T)})$ for smooth functions. Second, we
achieve a better dynamic regret bound of $O((1+V_T)^{2/3}T^{1/3})$ when
functions are smooth and strongly convex, and the constraint set is strongly
convex. Finally, for smooth and strongly convex functions with minimizers in
the interior of the constraint set, we demonstrate that the dynamic regret of
OFW reduces to $O(1+V_T)$, and can be further strengthened to
$O(\min\{P_T^\ast,S_T^\ast,V_T\}+1)$ by performing a constant number of FW
iterations per round, where $P_T^\ast$ and $S_T^\ast$ denote the path length
and squared path length of minimizers, respectively.

  Face Recognition: A Plain yet Effective New Baseline","AAAI 2023 R2HCAI Workshop",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although deep learning has significantly improved Face Recognition (FR),
dramatic performance deterioration may occur when processing Low Resolution
(LR) faces. To alleviate this, approaches based on unified feature space are
proposed with the sacrifice under High Resolution (HR) circumstances. To deal
with the huge domain gap between HR and LR domains and achieve the best on both
domains, we first took a closer look at the impacts of several resolution
augmentations and then analyzed the difficulty of LR samples from the
perspective of the model gradient produced by different resolution samples.
Besides, we also find that the introduction of some resolutions could help the
learning of lower resolutions. Based on these, we divide the LR samples into
three difficulties according to the resolution and propose a more effective
Multi-Resolution Augmentation. Then, due to the rapidly increasing domain gap
as the resolution decreases, we carefully design a novel and effective metric
loss based on a LogExp distance function that provides decent gradients to
prevent oscillation near the convergence point or tolerance to small distance
errors; it could also dynamically adjust the penalty for errors in different
dimensions, allowing for more optimization of dimensions with large errors.
Combining these two insights, our model could learn more general knowledge in a
wide resolution range of images and balanced results can be achieved by our
extremely simple framework. Moreover, the augmentations and metrics are the
cornerstones of LRFR, so our method could be considered a new baseline for the
LRFR task. Experiments on the LRFR datasets: SCface, XQLFW, and large-scale
LRFR dataset: TinyFace demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, while the
degradation on HRFR datasets is significantly reduced.

provisioning overheads, heterogeneous VM costs and Quality of Service (QoS) of
the cloud system. To address this, we propose a novel method, called CILP, that
formulates the VM provisioning problem as two sub-problems of prediction and
optimization, where the provisioning plan is optimized based on predicted
workload demands. CILP leverages a neural network as a surrogate model to
predict future workload demands with a co-simulated digital-twin of the

plan. A transformer based neural model reduces training and inference overheads
while our novel two-phase decision making loop facilitates in making informed

including resource utilization, deployment costs and provisioning overheads to
inform the provisioning decisions in our imitation learning framework.
Experiments with three public benchmarks demonstrate that CILP gives up to 22%

the search process into several stages during the search phase and increase
candidate operations into the search space progressively at the beginning of

However,
it is still a challenging topic to apply knowledge distillation to detection
tasks. There are two key points resulting in poor distillation performance for
detection tasks. One is the serious imbalance between foreground and background
features, another one is that small object lacks enough feature representation.
To solve the above issues, we propose a new distillation method named dual
relation knowledge distillation (DRKD), including pixel-wise relation
distillation and instance-wise relation distillation. The pixel-wise relation
distillation embeds pixel-wise features in the graph space and applies graph
convolution to capture the global pixel relation. By distilling the global
pixel relation, the student detector can learn the relation between foreground
and background features, and avoid the difficulty of distilling features
directly for the feature imbalance issue. Besides, we find that instance-wise
relation supplements valuable knowledge beyond independent features for small
objects. Thus, the instance-wise relation distillation is designed, which
calculates the similarity of different instances to obtain a relation matrix.
More importantly, a relation filter module is designed to highlight valuable
instance relations. The proposed dual relation knowledge distillation is
general and can be easily applied for both one-stage and two-stage detectors.

learning embeddings of entities and relations has attracted a surge of
interest. Temporal KGs(TKGs) extend traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by
associating static triples with timestamps forming quadruples. Different from
KGs and TKGs in the transductive setting, constantly emerging entities and
relations in incomplete TKGs create demand to predict missing facts with unseen
components, which is the extrapolation setting. Traditional temporal knowledge
graph embedding (TKGE) methods are limited in the extrapolation setting since
they are trained within a fixed set of components. In this paper, we propose a
Meta-Learning based Temporal Knowledge Graph Extrapolation (MTKGE) model, which
is trained on link prediction tasks sampled from the existing TKGs and tested
in the emerging TKGs with unseen entities and relations. Specifically, we
meta-train a GNN framework that captures relative position patterns and
temporal sequence patterns between relations. The learned embeddings of
patterns can be transferred to embed unseen components. Experimental results on
two different TKG extrapolation datasets show that MTKGE consistently
outperforms both the existing state-of-the-art models for knowledge graph
extrapolation and specifically adapted KGE and TKGE baselines.

laboratory-based gamma-ray radiation measurements with a NaI(Tl) scintillator
to perform Bayesian inference on a NPSM. Further, we apply machine learning to
emulate the detector response obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. We show that
the proposed methodology successfully constrains the NPSM and hereby quantifies
the intrinsic resolution. Moreover, using the trained emulators, we can predict
the spectral Compton edge dynamics as a function of the parameterized
scintillation mechanisms. The presented framework offers a novel way to infer
NPSMs for any inorganic scintillator without the need for additional electron

two-channel models. Within these models, one usually considers a single dressed
resonance, with the option to extend the analysis by including resonant
open-channel features that can drastically change the observed threshold
effects. For the strong $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ p-wave resonance studied in Ref.
\cite{ahmed2021}, the interplay between an open-channel shape resonance and the
Feshbach resonance could explain the unexpected nonlinear variation of the
binding energy with magnetic field. However, the presented two-channel
treatment relies on the introduction of two independent fitting parameters,
whereas the typical Breit-Wigner expression would only account for one. This
results in an effective magnetic moment that acquires a nonphysical value,
which is an indication of a major shortcoming of the two-channel model
treatment. In this study, we observe how the presence of a closed-channel shape
resonance explains the physical mechanism behind the observations and
demonstrates the need of a three-channel treatment. We introduce our novel
model as \textit{resonance facilitated}, where all coupling is mediated by the
Feshbach state, while there is no direct coupling between the additional
channel and the open channel. Notably, the resonance-facilitated structure
greatly reduces the complexity of the full three-channel model. The typical
Breit-Wigner form of the two-channel Feshbach formalism is retained and the
full effect of the added channel can be captured by a single resonance dressing
factor, which describes how the free propagation in the Feshbach state is
dressed by the added channel.

However, all of the previous state-of-the-art works are restricted to only one

precisely with independent and complete control of optical properties of

In the previous works, hierarchical information is only integrated in the

coherency without any assumptions, but also allow more flexible and realistic
constraints to achieve task-based targets, e.g., lower under-estimation penalty

tasks. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our tree-based

are comparable to that of an AA-stacking region in the TBG. When the size of
the bubble is smaller than that of an AA-stacking region, the bubble becomes
motionless and is fixed in the AA-stacking region because of its large

operation that dominates the computing cost in many scientific applications.
Due to providing massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, GPUs are
commonly used to accelerate SpMV kernels. Prior studies mainly focused on
reducing the latency of SpMV kernels on GPU. However, few attempts have been
made to improve the energy efficiency of SpMV kernels, resulting in GPUs being
excluded from the range of low-power applications. Furthermore, prior work has
primarily focused on optimizing the sparse format of SpMV kernels, the
literature ignores evaluating the impact of tweaking compilation parameters.
Lastly, Little attention has been paid to preparing a comprehensive training
dataset of running SpMV kernels and fine-tuning the learning hyperparameters.
To address these limitations, we present a novel framework, dubbed Auto-SpMV,
that enables energy-efficient and low-latency SpMV kernels on GPU. To achieve
the best run time performance, Auto-SpMV proposes two optimization modes:
compile-time and run-time. In the compile-time mode, Auto-SpMV tweaks the
compilation parameters, while in the run-time mode, Auto-SpMV selects the best
sparse format for the sparse input matrix. To achieve the best classification
results, 1) we collect the largest dataset ever having 30 different sparse
matrices running with more than 15K different configurations, and 2) we boost
classification models by automatically fine-tuning the learning
hyperparameters. Experimental results reveal that Auto-SpMV optimizes latency,
energy consumption, average power, and energy efficiency in the compile-time
mode by up to 51.9%, 52%, 33.2%, and 53%, respectively, compared to the default
setting. Auto-SpMV optimizes average power and energy efficiency in the
run-time mode by up to 34.6% and 99.7%, respectively, compared to the default
setting.

semantic segmentation, leveraging IoU losses as part of the loss function is
shown to perform better with respect to the Jaccard index measure than
optimizing pixel-wise losses such as the cross-entropy loss alone. The most
notable IoU losses are the soft Jaccard loss and the Lovasz-Softmax loss.
However, these losses are incompatible with soft labels which are ubiquitous in
machine learning. In this paper, we propose Jaccard metric losses (JMLs), which
are identical to the soft Jaccard loss in a standard setting with hard labels,
but are compatible with soft labels. With JMLs, we study two of the most
popular use cases of soft labels: label smoothing and knowledge distillation.
With a variety of architectures, our experiments show significant improvements
over the cross-entropy loss on three semantic segmentation datasets

on singular projective varieties defined over an algebraically closed field of

  In the first case, we consider analogues of numerically flat vector bundles
on a big open subset of a normal projective variety (with arbitrary
singularities). Here we introduce the S-fundamental group scheme for
quasi-projective varieties that admit compactifications with complement of
codimension $\ge 2$. We prove that this group scheme coincides with the
S-funda\-men\-tal group scheme of the regular locus of any of its (small)
projective compactification. In particular, it provides a new invariant for
normal projective varieties isomorphic in codimension $1$.
  In the second case, we consider vector bundles with an integrable
$\lambda$-connection on a normal projective variety $X$ that is (almost)
liftable modulo $p^2$. In this case we restrict to varieties with $F$-liftable
singularities that are analogous to log canonical singularities. We prove that
a semistable Higgs vector bundle on the regular locus of $X$, with
appropriately defined vanishing Chern classes, admits a canonical Higgs--de
Rham flow. This provides an analogue of some results due to D. Greb, S.

collaboratively modeling multi-parties' joint features with current efficient

function to maximize its own profit and simultaneously ensure the truthful
announcing of the agent's private information (type) and its participation in
the task, while an autonomous agent aims at maximizing its own utility function
by deciding on its participation level and announced type. Our mechanism stands
out from the classical contract theory-based truthful mechanisms as it empowers
agents to make their own decisions about their level of involvement, making it
more practical for many real-world task allocation scenarios. It has been
proven that by considering a linear form of incentive function consisting of
two decision functions for the task publisher the mechanism's goals are met.
The proposed truthful mechanism is initially modeled as a non-convex functional
optimization with the double continuum of constraints, nevertheless, we
demonstrate that by deriving an equivalent form of the incentive constraints,
it can be reformulated as a tractable convex optimal control problem. Further,
we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain the solution.

Responsivity and detectivity of deposited thin films of all self-deficient

intersection problems. While both problems admit a polynomial-time
approximation scheme (PTAS) [Berger et al. (Math. Programming, 2011), Chekuri,
Vondrak and Zenklusen (SODA 2011)], it has been an intriguing open question
whether these problems admit a fully PTAS (FPTAS), or even an efficient PTAS
(EPTAS).
  In this paper we answer the second part of this question affirmatively, by
presenting an EPTAS for budgeted matching and budgeted matroid intersection. A
main component of our scheme is a novel construction of representative sets for
desired solutions, whose cardinality depends only on $\varepsilon$, the
accuracy parameter. Thus, enumerating over solutions within a representative
set leads to an EPTAS. This crucially distinguishes our algorithms from
previous approaches, which rely on exhaustive enumeration over the solution
set. Our ideas for constructing representative sets may find use in tackling
other budgeted optimization problems, and are thus of independent interest.

  Distribution","Submitted to SEA 2023",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the following problem: given a set of indices $S = \{1, \dots,
n\}$ and weights $w_1, \dots, w_n \in \mathbb{R}_{> 0}$, provide samples from
$S$ with distribution $p(i) = w_i / W$ where $W = \sum_j w_j$ gives the proper
normalization. In the static setting, there is a simple data structure due to
Walker called Alias Table that allows for samples to be drawn in constant time.
A more challenging task is to maintain the distribution in a dynamic setting,
where elements may be added or removed, or weights may change over time; here,
existing solutions restrict the permissible weights, require rebuilding of the
associated data structure after a number of updates, or are rather complex.
  In this paper, we describe, analyze, and engineer a simple data structure for
maintaining a discrete probability distribution in the dynamic setting.
Construction of the data structure for an arbitrary distribution takes time
$O(n)$, sampling takes expected time $O(1)$, and updates of size $\Delta = O(W
/ n)$ can be processed in time $O(1)$. To evaluate the efficiency of the data
structure we conduct an experimental study. The results suggest that the
dynamic sampling performance is comparable to the static Alias Table with a
minor slowdown.

internal organs by maintaining close contact between the ultrasound probe and
the patient's body during a scanning procedure. Comprehensive, high-quality
ultrasound scans are essential for providing the patient with an accurate
diagnosis and effective treatment plan. An ultrasound scanning robot usually
works in a doctor-robot co-existing environment, hence both efficiency and
safety during the collaboration should be considered. In this paper, we propose
a novel multi-modal control scheme for ultrasound scanning robots, in which
three interaction modes are integrated into a single control input.
Specifically, the scanning mode drives the robot to track a time-varying
trajectory on the patient's body under the desired impedance model; the
recovery mode allows the robot to actively recontact the body whenever physical
contact between the ultrasound probe and the patient's body is lost; the
human-guided mode renders the robot passive such that the doctor can safely
intervene to manually reposition the probe. The integration of multiple modes
allows the doctor to intervene safely at any time during the task and also
maximizes the robot's autonomous scanning ability. The performance of the robot
is validated on a collaborative scanning task of a carotid artery examination.

for incompressible flows. Following previous works on semi-implicit hybrid
FV/FE schemes, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are split into a
pressure and a transport-diffusion subsystem. The first of them can be seen as
a Poisson type problem and is thus solved efficiently using classical
continuous Lagrange finite elements. On the other hand, finite volume methods
are employed to solve the convective subsystem, in combination with
Crouzeix-Raviart finite elements for the discretization of the viscous stress
tensor. For some applications, the related CFL condition, even if depending
only in the bulk velocity, may yield a severe time restriction in case explicit
schemes are used. To overcome this issue an implicit approach is proposed. The
system obtained from the implicit discretization of the transport-diffusion
operator is solved using an inexact Newton-Krylov method, based either on the
BiCStab or the GMRES algorithm. To improve the convergence properties of the
linear solver a symmetric Gauss-Seidel (SGS) preconditioner is employed,
together with a simple but efficient approach for the reordering of the grid
elements that is compatible with MPI parallelization. Besides, considering the
Ducros flux for the nonlinear convective terms we can prove that the discrete
advection scheme is kinetic energy stable. The methodology is carefully
assessed through a set of classical benchmarks for fluid mechanics. A last test
shows the potential applicability of the method in the context of blood flow

We develop a GCI-based Hilbert expansion method, and establish rigorously the
asymptotic regime from the kinetic Cucker-Smale model with a confining
potential in a mesoscopic scale to the macroscopic limit system for
self-propelled individuals, which is derived formally by Aceves-S\'anchez,
Bostan, Carrillo and Degond (2019).
  In the traditional kinetic equation with collisions, for example, Boltzmann
type equations, the key properties that connect the kinetic and fluid regimes
are: the linearized collision operator (linearized collision operator around
the equilibrium), denoted by $\mathcal{L}$, is symmetric, and has a nontrivial
null space (its elements are called collision invariants) which include all the
fluid information, i.e. the dimension of Ker($\mathcal{L}$) is equal to the
number of fluid variables. Furthermore, the moments of the collision invariants
with the kinetic equations give the macroscopic equations.
  The new feature and difficulty of the corresponding problem considered in
this paper is: the linearized operator $\mathcal{L}$ is not symmetric, i.e.
$\mathcal{L}\neq \mathcal{L}^*$, where $\mathcal{L}^*$ is the dual of

which is called generalized collision invariants (GCI). This is fundamentally
different with classical Boltzmann type equations. This is a common feature of
many collective motions of self-propelled particles with alignment in living
systems, or many active particle system. Another difficulty (also common for
active system) is involved by the normalization of the direction vector, which
is highly nonlinear.

  autocorrelation function of a liquid metal",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  A very recent simulation study of the transverse current autocorrelation of
the Lennard-Jones fluid revealed, as expected, that this function can be
perfectly described within the exponential expansion theory. However, above a
certain wavevector $Q$, not only transverse collective excitations are found to
propagate in the fluid, but a second oscillatory component of unclear origin
(thereby called X) must be considered to properly account for the time behavior
of the correlation. Here we present an extended investigation of the transverse
current autocorrelation of liquid Au as obtained by ab initio molecular
dynamics in the very wide range 5.7 nm$^{-1}$ $\le Q \le$ 32.8 nm$^{-1}$ in
order to follow the behavior of the X component, if present, also at large $Q$
values. By combining the study of the transverse current autocorrelation with
the analogous analysis of its self part, we show that the second oscillatory
component originates from the longitudinal dynamics and appears in the same
form as a collective excitation is represented in the single-particle behavior.
Therefore, the signature of the longitudinal processes (sound waves) in the
transverse current autocorrelation is not due to often conjectured couplings of
longitudinal and trasverse modes, but descends from the self part of the
function, which contains the traces of all processes acting in the fluid as the
density of states, that is the spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation
function, does.

world. It has become one of the most focused topics to improve health services
for data-scarce hospitals and promote health equity through knowledge sharing
among medical institutions. Because electronic medical records (EMRs) contain
sensitive personal information, privacy protection is unavoidable and essential
for multi-hospital collaboration. In this paper, for a common disease in ICU
patients, sepsis, we propose a novel cross-center collaborative learning
framework guided by medical knowledge, SofaNet, to achieve early recognition of
this disease. The Sepsis-3 guideline, published in 2016, defines that sepsis
can be diagnosed by satisfying both suspicion of infection and Sequential Organ
Failure Assessment (SOFA) greater than or equal to 2. Based on this knowledge,
SofaNet adopts a multi-channel GRU structure to predict SOFA values of
different systems, which can be seen as an auxiliary task to generate better
health status representations for sepsis recognition. Moreover, we only achieve
feature distribution alignment in the hidden space during cross-center
collaborative learning, which ensures secure and compliant knowledge transfer
without raw data exchange. Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets,
MIMIC-III and Challenge, demonstrate that SofaNet can benefit early sepsis
recognition when hospitals only have limited EMRs.

analyze such systems' vulnerabilities against external adversarial attacks. We
find that even very simple perturbations in uni-modal and multi-modal settings
performed by humans with little knowledge about the model can make the existing
detection models highly vulnerable. Empirically, we find a noticeable
performance drop of as high as 10% in the macro-F1 score for certain attacks.
As a remedy, we attempt to boost the model's robustness using contrastive
learning as well as an adversarial training-based method - VILLA. Using an
ensemble of the above two approaches, in two of our high resolution datasets,
we are able to (re)gain back the performance to a large extent for certain

only a few words in the toxic content. Moreover, modern content moderation
software performance against malicious inputs remains underexplored. To this
end, we propose MTTM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Textual content
Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2,000 text

across three perturbation levels: character, word, and sentence. MTTM employs
these metamorphic relations on toxic textual contents to generate test cases,
which are still toxic yet likely to evade moderation. In our evaluation, we
employ MTTM to test three commercial textual content moderation software and
two state-of-the-art moderation algorithms against three kinds of toxic

  disease",,,,,"q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Although neurocognitive models have been proposed to explain anosognosia in
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the neural cascade responsible for its origin in the
human brain remains unknown. Here, we build on a mechanistic dual-path
hypothesis that brings error-monitoring and emotional processing systems as key
elements for self-awareness, with distinct impacts on the emergence of
anosognosia in AD. Proceeding from the notion of anosognosia as a dimensional
syndrome, ranging from the lack of concern about one's own deficits (i.e.,
anosodiaphoria) to the complete lack of awareness of deficits, our hypothesis
states that (i) unawareness of deficits would result from a failure in the
error-monitoring system, whereas (ii) anosodiaphoria would more likely result
from an imbalance between emotional processing and error-monitoring systems. In
the first case, a synaptic failure in the error-monitoring system, in which the
cingulate cortex plays a major role, would have a negative impact on error (or
deficits) awareness, preventing patients from becoming aware of their
condition. In the second case, an impairment in the emotional processing
system, in which the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex play a major role, would
prevent patients from monitoring the internal milieu for relevant errors (or
deficits) and assigning appropriate value to them, thus biasing their impact on
the error-monitoring system. Our hypothesis stems from two scientific premises.
One comes from preliminary results in AD patients showing a synaptic failure in
the error-monitoring system and decline of awareness at the time of diagnosis.
Another comes from the somatic marker hypothesis, which proposes that emotional
signals are critical to adaptive behavior. Further exploration will be of great
interest to illuminate the foundations of self-awareness and improve our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms of anosognosia in AD.

with several edge computing devices under the coordination of a centralized
server, is plagued by inconsistent local stationary points due to the
heterogeneity of the local partial participation clients, which precipitates
the local client-drifts problems and sparks off the unstable and slow
convergence, especially on the aggravated heterogeneous dataset. To address
these issues, we propose a novel federated learning algorithm, named FedMIM,
which adopts the multi-step inertial momentum on the edge devices and enhances
the local consistency for free during the training to improve the robustness of
the heterogeneity. Specifically, we incorporate the weighted global gradient
estimations as the inertial correction terms to guide both the local iterates
and stochastic gradient estimation, which can reckon the global objective
optimization on the edges' heterogeneous dataset naturally and maintain the
demanding consistent iteration locally. Theoretically, we show that FedMIM
achieves the $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{SKT}})$ convergence rate with a linear
speedup property with respect to the number of selected clients $S$ and proper
local interval $K$ in communication round $T$ without convex assumption.
Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments on various real-world
datasets and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed FedMIM against several

  Models -- A General Framework",,,,,"stat.ML cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This article describes an approach to incorporate expert opinion on
observable quantities through the use of a loss function which updates a prior
belief as opposed to specifying parameters on the priors. Eliciting information
on observable quantities allows experts to provide meaningful information on a
quantity familiar to them, in contrast to elicitation on model parameters,
which may be subject to interactions with other parameters or non-linear
transformations before obtaining an observable quantity. The approach to
incorporating expert opinion described in this paper is distinctive in that we
do not specify a prior to match an expert's opinion on observed quantity,
rather we obtain a posterior by updating the model parameters through a loss
function. This loss function contains the observable quantity, expressed a
function of the parameters, and is related to the expert's opinion which is
typically operationalized as a statistical distribution. Parameters which
generate observable quantities which are further from the expert's opinion
incur a higher loss, allowing for the model parameters to be estimated based on
their fidelity to both the data and expert opinion, with the relative strength
determined by the number of observations and precision of the elicited belief.
Including expert opinion in this fashion allows for a flexible specification of
the opinion and in many situations is straightforward to implement with
commonly used probabilistic programming software. We highlight this using three
worked examples of varying model complexity including survival models, a
multivariate normal distribution and a regression problem.

landmarks. We explicitly specify the two properties that should be satisfied by
generative models, the reconstruction ability and the locality-preserving
property, to guide the selection of generators for local explanation methods.

propose another method that implements progressive neighborhood approximation
with probability-based editions as an alternative to the generator-based

psychological interpreting. To meet the demands for psychoanalysis, we
introduce a challenging task, \textbf{V}isual \textbf{E}motion
\textbf{I}nterpretation \textbf{T}ask (VEIT). VEIT requires AI to generate
reasonable interpretations of creator's psychological state through visual
creations. To support the task, we present a multimodal dataset termed SpyIn
(\textbf{S}and\textbf{p}la\textbf{y} \textbf{In}terpretation Dataset), which is
psychological theory supported and professional annotated. Dataset analysis
illustrates that SpyIn is not only able to support VEIT, but also more
challenging compared with other captioning datasets. Building on SpyIn, we
conduct experiments of several image captioning method, and propose a
visual-semantic combined model which obtains a SOTA result on SpyIn. The
results indicate that VEIT is a more challenging task requiring scene graph

scalar field. Our result shows that the oscillation frequency of quasinormal
modes is enhanced as magnetic charge $g$ or the dark matter parameter $\alpha$
increases. For damping rate of quasinormal modes, the influence of them is
different. Specifically, the increase of dark matter parameter $\alpha$ makes
the damping rate increasing at first and then decreasing. While the damping
rate is continuously decreasing with the increase of the magnetic charge $g$.
Moreover, we find that the increase of the dark matter parameter $\alpha$
enhances the power emission spectrum whereas magnetic charge $g$ suppresses it.
This means that the lifespan of black holes increases for smaller value of
$\alpha$ and larger value of $g$ when other parameters are fixed. Finally, the
absorption cross section of the considered black hole is calculated with the
help of the partial wave approach. Our result suggests that the absorption
cross section decreases with the dark matter $\alpha$ or the magnetic charge
$g$ increasing.

critical in ensuring data quality and producing reliable data-driven predictive
models. Apart from many statistical approaches, a few recent studies have
proposed state-of-the-art deep learning methods to impute missing values in MTS
data. However, the evaluation of these deep methods is limited to one or two
data sets, low missing rates, and completely random missing value types. This
survey performs six data-centric experiments to benchmark state-of-the-art deep
imputation methods on five time series health data sets. Our extensive analysis
reveals that no single imputation method outperforms the others on all five
data sets. The imputation performance depends on data types, individual
variable statistics, missing value rates, and types. Deep learning methods that
jointly perform cross-sectional (across variables) and longitudinal (across
time) imputations of missing values in time series data yield statistically
better data quality than traditional imputation methods. Although
computationally expensive, deep learning methods are practical given the
current availability of high-performance computing resources, especially when
data quality and sample size are highly important in healthcare informatics.
Our findings highlight the importance of data-centric selection of imputation
methods to optimize data-driven predictive models.

of networks -- a random graph, the Barab\'{a}si--Albert(BA) model, and lattice
networks -- by using one parameter $\omega$; $\omega=1,0, -1$ respectively
correspond to these networks. Our objective is to study the relation between
the phase transitions and networks using $\omega$. In $\omega=\ne -1$, without
a lattice, the following two types of phase transitions can be observed:
cascade transition and super-normal transition. The first is the transition
between a state wherein most voters make correct choices and a state wherein
most of them are wrong. This is an absorption transition that belongs to a
non-equilibrium transition. In the symmetric case, the phase transition is
continuous and the universality class is the same as nonlinear P\'{o}lya model.
In contrast, in the asymmetric case, it is a discontinuous phase transition,
where the gap in the discontinuous phase transition depends on the network. As
$\omega$ increases, the size of the hub and the gap increase. Critical point of
information cascade transition do not depend on $\omega$. The super-normal
transition is the transition of the convergence speed, and the critical point
of the convergence speed transition depends on $\omega$. At $\omega=1$, in the
BA model, this transition disappears, and the range where we can observe the
phase transition is the same as in the percolation model on the network. Both
phase transitions disappeared at $\omega=-1$ in the lattice case. In
conclusion, near the lattice case, $\omega\sim-1$ exhibited the best
performance of the voting in all networks. Finally, we show the relation
between the voting model and elephant walk model.

period of P = 34.9 hr. This binary belongs to a group of systems that can be
the progenitors of gravitational wave sources, hence understanding the dynamics
of systems such as IC 10 X-1 is of paramount importance. The prominent He II
4686 emission line (previously used in mass estimates of the BH) is out of
phase with the X-ray eclipse, suggesting that this line originates somewhere in
the ionized wind of the WR star or in the accretion disk. We obtained 52
spectra from the GEMINI/GMOS archive, observed between 2001 and 2019. We
analyzed the spectra both individually, and after binning them by orbital phase
to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. The RV curve from the stacked data is
similar to historical results, indicating the overall parameters of the binary
have remained constant. However, the He II line profile shows a correlation
with the X-ray hardness-ratio values, also, we report a pronounced skewness of
the line-profile, and the skewness varies with the orbital phase. These results
support a paradigm wherein the He II line tracks structures in the stellar wind
that are produced by interactions with the BH's ionizing radiation and the
accretion flow. We compare the observable signatures of two alternative
hypotheses proposed in the literature: wind irradiation plus shadowing, and
accretion disk hotspot; and we explore how the line-profile variations fit into
each of these models.

such as node classification and graph classification. Recent studies find that
GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. However, effective backdoor attacks
on graphs are still an open problem. In particular, backdoor attack poisons the
graph by attaching triggers and the target class label to a set of nodes in the
training graph. The backdoored GNNs trained on the poisoned graph will then be
misled to predict test nodes to target class once attached with triggers.
Though there are some initial efforts in graph backdoor attacks, our empirical
analysis shows that they may require a large attack budget for effective
backdoor attacks and the injected triggers can be easily detected and pruned.
Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel problem of unnoticeable graph
backdoor attacks with limited attack budget. To fully utilize the attack
budget, we propose to deliberately select the nodes to inject triggers and
target class labels in the poisoning phase. An adaptive trigger generator is
deployed to obtain effective triggers that are difficult to be noticed.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets against various defense strategies
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in conducting effective
unnoticeable backdoor attacks.

that the trained machine is able to not only infer the synchronization
performance of any new allocation scheme, but also find from a huge amount of

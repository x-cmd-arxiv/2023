synthesized by high-temperature solution growth in single crystalline form and
characterized by X-ray diffraction, elemental analysis, magnetic and transport
measurements. The effects of Cr substitution on the superconducting and
magnetic ground states of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ ($T_c$ = 35 K) have been studied.
These measurements show that the superconducting transition temperature
decreases monotonically and is finally suppressed below 1.8 K as $x$ is
increased from 0 to 0.038. The magnetic transition temperature increases in a
roughly linear manner as Cr substitution increases. A temperature-composition
(\textit{T}-\textit{x}) phase diagram is constructed, revealing a half-dome of
superconductivity with the magnetic transition temperature, $T^*$, appearing
near 22~K for $x$ $\sim$ 0.017 and rising slowly up to 60~K for $x$ $\sim$
0.077. The $T$-$x$ phase diagrams for CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$$T$$_{x}$)$_4$As$_4$ for
$T$ = Cr and Mn are essentially the same despite the nominally different band
filling; this is in marked contrast to $T$ = Co and Ni series for which the
$T$-$x$ diagrams scale by a factor of two, consistent with the different
changes in band filling Co and Ni would produce when replacing Fe.
Superconductivity of CaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Cr$_{x}$)$_{4}$As$_{4}$ is also studied as a
function of magnetic field. A clear change in $H^\prime_{c2}$($T$)/$T_c$, where
$H^\prime_{c2}$($T$) is d$H_{c2}$($T$)/d$T$, at $x$ $\sim$ 0.012 is observed
and probably is related to change of the Fermi surface due to magnetic order.
Coherence length and the London penetration depths are also calculated based on
$H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ data. Coherence lengths as the function of $x$ also shows
changes near $x$ = 0.012, again consistent with Fermi surfaces changes
associated with the magnetic ordering seen for higher $x$-values.

social/anthropomorphic biases in their treatment of technology. Such insights
have encouraged the design of interfaces that interact with users in more
social (chatty or even friend-like) ways. However, in typical `dark pattern'
fashion, social-emotional responses to systems as (seemingly sentient) agents
can be harnessed to manipulate user behaviour. An increasingly common example
is app notifications that assume person-like tones to persuade or pressure
users into compliance. Regardless of being manipulative, difficulties meeting
contextual social expectations can make automated social acting seem rude,
invasive, tactless, and even disrespectful - constituting 'social'
anti-patterns. This paper explores ways to improve how automated systems treat
people in interactions. We mixed four qualitative methods to elicit user
experiences and preferences regarding how automated systems ""talk"" to/at them.
We identify an emerging 'social' class of dark and anti-patterns, and propose
guidelines for helping (social) interfaces treat users in more respectful,
tactful, and autonomy-supportive ways.

machine learning and deep learning approaches for a range of RE tasks, such as
requirements classification, requirements tracing, ambiguity detection, and
modelling. However, most of today's ML/DL approaches are based on supervised
learning techniques, meaning that they need to be trained using a large amount
of task-specific labelled training data. This constraint poses an enormous
challenge to RE researchers, as the lack of labelled data makes it difficult
for them to fully exploit the benefit of advanced ML/DL technologies.
Objective: This paper addresses this problem by showing how a zero-shot
learning approach can be used for requirements classification without using any
labelled training data. We focus on the classification task because many RE
tasks can be framed as classification problems. Method: The ZSL approach used
in our study employs contextual word-embeddings and transformer-based language
models. We demonstrate this approach through a series of experiments to perform
three classification tasks: (1)FR/NFR: classification functional requirements
vs non-functional requirements; (2)NFR: identification of NFR classes;
(3)Security: classification of security vs non-security requirements. Results:
The study shows that the ZSL approach achieves an F1 score of 0.66 for the
FR/NFR task. For the NFR task, the approach yields F1~0.72-0.80, considering
the most frequent classes. For the Security task, F1~0.66. All of the
aforementioned F1 scores are achieved with zero-training efforts. Conclusion:
This study demonstrates the potential of ZSL for requirements classification.
An important implication is that it is possible to have very little or no
training data to perform classification tasks. The proposed approach thus
contributes to the solution of the long-standing problem of data shortage in
RE.

which two vertices $u$, $v \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ are adjacent if and only if
$\|u-v\|_\infty=1$. Levin and Linial, London, and Rabinovich conjectured that
every connected graph $G$ of polynomial growth admits an injective homomorphism
to $\mathsf{Grid}_{n,\infty}$ for some $n<\infty$. Moreover, they conjectured
that if every ball of radius $r$ in $G$ contains at most $(r+1)^\rho$ vertices,
then one can take $n = O(\rho)$. Krauthgamer and Lee proved the first part of
this conjecture and refuted the second. In this paper we extend their result in
a number of ways:
  (1) We construct asymptotically injective contractions from graphs $G$ of
polynomial growth to the grid graph $\mathsf{Grid}_{n,\infty}$ with $n =
O(\rho)$, where $\rho$ is the asymptotic polynomial growth rate of $G$. This
confirms the second part of the Levin/Linial--London--Rabinovich conjecture ""in
the asymptotic sense.""
  (2) We construct coarse embeddings from graphs of polynomial growth to grid
graphs, answering a question of Papasoglu.
  (3) We extend the Krauthgamer--Lee theorem and all our results to the realm
of Borel graphs and prove that graphs generated by free Borel actions of
$\mathbb{Z}^n$ are, in an appropriate sense, universal for the class of Borel
graphs of polynomial growth.
  Along the way we find an alternative proof of the result of Papasoglu that
graphs of polynomial growth rate $\rho<\infty$ have asymptotic dimension at
most $\rho$. Furthermore, our proof works in the Borel setting and shows that
Borel graphs of polynomial growth rate $\rho<\infty$ have Borel asymptotic
dimension at most $\rho$, and hence they are hyperfinite. This generalizes a
result of Jackson, Kechris, and Louveau from Schreier graphs of Borel group
actions to arbitrary Borel graphs of polynomial growth and answers a question

The assessment includes RUL prediction accuracy, the quality of predictive

terms of accuracy, we find differences in the way they estimate uncertainty.
Thus, DE and MCD generally provide more conservative predictive uncertainty

aims to bridge a number of disciplines to partly address a longstanding

pricing of cyber-insurance. It is important to note the following: insurance
companies have long experience of the magnitude and frequency of losses that
arise in organizations based on their size, industry sector, and location.
Consequently, their calculations of premia will start from a baseline

cyber-based risk on the frequency and magnitude of losses. This is achieved
through a security analysis of the relationship between the operational

viruses, and their mechanism are spread across a huge number of scientific
articles. These articles are a large-scale knowledge source and can have a huge
impact on disseminating knowledge about the mechanisms of certain biological
processes. A domain-specific knowledge graph~(KG) is an explicit
conceptualization of a specific subject-matter domain represented w.r.t
semantically interrelated entities and relations. A KG can be constructed by
integrating such facts and data and be used for data integration, exploration,
and federated queries. However, exploration and querying large-scale KGs is
tedious for certain groups of users due to a lack of knowledge about underlying
data assets or semantic technologies. Such a KG will not only allow deducing
new knowledge and question answering(QA) but also allows domain experts to
explore. Since cross-disciplinary explanations are important for accurate
diagnosis, it is important to query the KG to provide interactive explanations
about learned biomarkers. Inspired by these, we construct a domain-specific KG,
particularly for cancer-specific biomarker discovery. The KG is constructed by
integrating cancer-related knowledge and facts from multiple sources. First, we
construct a domain-specific ontology, which we call OncoNet Ontology (ONO). The
ONO ontology is developed to enable semantic reasoning for verification of the
predictions for relations between diseases and genes. The KG is then developed
and enriched by harmonizing the ONO, additional metadata schemas, ontologies,
controlled vocabularies, and additional concepts from external sources using a
BERT-based information extraction method. BioBERT and SciBERT are finetuned
with the selected articles crawled from PubMed. We listed down some queries and
some examples of QA and deducing knowledge based on the KG.

tests have been shown to have excellent statistical properties. However, a
simple online implementation is computationally infeasible as, at time $T$, it
involves considering $O(T)$ possible locations for the change. Recently, the
FOCuS algorithm has been introduced for detecting changes in mean in Gaussian
data that decreases the per-iteration cost to $O(\log T)$. This is possible by
using pruning ideas, which reduce the set of changepoint locations that need to
be considered at time $T$ to approximately $\log T$. We show that if one wishes
to perform the likelihood ratio test for a different one-parameter exponential
family model, then exactly the same pruning rule can be used, and again one
need only consider approximately $\log T$ locations at iteration $T$.
Furthermore, we show how we can adaptively perform the maximisation step of the
algorithm so that we need only maximise the test statistic over a small subset
of these possible locations. Empirical results show that the resulting online
algorithm, which can detect changes under a wide range of models, has a
constant-per-iteration cost on average.

  arXiv:2206.11845",,,,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Blockchain technologies are facing a scalability challenge, which must be
overcome to guarantee a wider adoption of the technology. This scalability
issue is due to the use of consensus algorithms to guarantee the total order of
the chain of blocks and of the transactions within each block. However, total
order is often not fully necessary, since important advanced applications of
smart-contracts do not require a total order among all operations. A much
higher scalability can potentially be achieved if a more relaxed order can be
exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel distributed concurrent data type,
called Setchain, which improves scalability significantly. A Setchain
implements a grow-only set whose elements are not ordered, unlike conventional
blockchain operations. When convenient, the Setchain allows forcing a
synchronization barrier that assigns permanently an epoch number to a subset of
the latest elements added, agreed by consensus. Therefore, two operations in
the same epoch are not ordered, while two operations in different epochs are
ordered by their respective epoch number. We present different
Byzantine-tolerant implementations of Setchain, prove their correctness and
report on an empirical evaluation of a prototype implementation. Our results
show that Setchain is orders of magnitude faster than consensus-based ledgers,
since it implements grow-only sets with epoch synchronization instead of total
order. Since Setchain barriers can be synchronized with the underlying
blockchain, Setchain objects can be used as a sidechain to implement many
decentralized solutions with much faster operations than direct implementations
on top of blockchains. Finally, we also present an algorithm that encompasses
in a single process the combined behavior of Byzantine servers, which
simplifies correctness proofs by encoding the general attacker in a concrete
implementation.

based on only the existence of OWFs. We introduce inefficient-verifier proofs

IV-PoQ is an interactive protocol between a verifier and a quantum prover
consisting of two phases. In the first phase, the verifier is probabilistic
polynomial-time, and it interacts with the prover. In the second phase, the
verifier becomes inefficient, and makes its decision based on the transcript of
the first phase. If the prover is honest, the inefficient verifier accepts with
high probability, but any classical malicious prover only has a small
probability of being accepted by the inefficient verifier. Our construction
demonstrates the following results: (1)If one-way functions exist, then IV-PoQ
exist. (2)If distributional collision-resistant hash functions exist (which
exist if hard-on-average problems in $\mathbf{SZK}$ exist), then constant-round

elevated temperatures, but unfortunately are inherently brittle. Mg-Al-Ca
alloys thus have good creep properties but limited ductility. An understanding
of the co-deformation behaviour of $\alpha$-Mg and Laves phases is essential
for optimising the strength-ductility balance of these alloys. Here, we study
the mechanical behaviour of a Mg-4.65Al-2.82Ca alloy using micropillar
compression in the $\alpha$-Mg matrix, at $\alpha$-Mg/C36 and $\alpha$-Mg/C15
interfaces and in the C15 phase in combination with scanning electron

Kikuchi diffraction (TKD), and low-kV scanning transmission electron microscopy

strengthening to the $\alpha$-Mg matrix by delaying the onset of basal slip and
extension twinning, while only the C36 phase appears to allow a certain extent
of slip transfer/ plastic co-deformation, in spite of its greater anisotropy
compared with the cubic C15 phase. We therefore conclude based on these results
that strengthening of the $\alpha$-Mg matrix by the C36 Laves phase is
preferable given that it combines easy skeleton formation with some
co-deformation and considerable stability at common application temperatures of

is the heavy fermion paramagnet uranium ditelluride (UTe$_2$), which has
recently been found to exhibit numerous characteristics of an unconventional
spin-triplet pairing state. To date, efforts to understand the microscopic
details of superconductivity in UTe$_2$ have been severely impeded by
uncertainty regarding the underlying electronic structure. Here, we directly
probe the Fermi surface of UTe$_2$ by measuring magnetic quantum oscillations
in ultra-pure crystals, as evidenced by their high superconducting transition
temperature $T_\text{c} \approx$ 2.1 K and residual resistivity ratio (RRR)
$\approx$ 900. We find an angular profile of quantum oscillatory frequency and
amplitude that is characteristic of a quasi-2D Fermi surface, exhibiting heavy
effective masses up to 78(2) $m_e$ owing to strong correlations. We performed
Fermi surface simulations guided by these data, yielding excellent
correspondence between quantum oscillation measurements and our resultant Fermi
surface model, which consists of two cylindrical sections of electron- and
hole-type respectively. A comparison between the density of states at the Fermi
level inferred from the quantum oscillations, and the normal state Sommerfeld
coefficient obtained from specific heat measurements, gives excellent agreement
with our Fermi surface model. Additionally, we find that both cylindrical Fermi
sheets possess negligible corrugation, which may allow for their near-nesting
and therefore promote magnetic fluctuations that enhance the triplet pairing
mechanism. Our results place strong constraints on the possible symmetry of the
superconducting order parameter in UTe$_2$.

concentration, indicating potential for exploiting such behavior towards
maximizing nanoparticle generation. Furthermore, we discuss a link between

challenges this assumption, particularly further escalation after a certain

  statistically significant pattern reversal under the log-transform",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  The log-transform is a common tool in statistical analysis, reducing the
impact of extreme values, compressing the range of reported values for improved
visualization, enabling the usage of parametric statistical tests requiring
normally distributed data, or enabling linear models on non-linear data.
Practitioners are rarely aware that log-transformed results can reverse
findings: a hypothesis test without the transform can show a negative trend,
while with the log-transform, it can show a positive trend, both statistically
significant. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions underlying this
paradoxical pattern reversal using finite difference notation. We show that
biomedical image quantification is very susceptible to these conditions. Using
a novel heuristic maximizing the reversal, we show that statistical
significance of the paradoxical pattern reversal can be easily induced by
changing as little as 5% of a dataset. We illustrate how quantifying the sizes
of objects in proportional data, especially where object sizes capture
underlying creation and destruction dynamics, satisfies the precondition for
the paradox. We discuss recommendations on proper use of the log-transform,
discuss methods to explore the underlying patterns robustly, and emphasize that
any transformed result should always be accompanied by its non-transformed
source equivalent to exclude accidental confounded findings.

for quark masses. Quarkyonic matter is composed of a shell of nucleons that
under-occupy the total available phase space associated with the underlying
quark degrees of freedom. The fully occupied Fermi sphere beneath this shell of
nucleons at high densities is thought of as quarks, but when this fully
occupied distribution of states first appears, although the phase space is
filled, the matter is at low density. For the transition between this low
density and high density saturated matter, we advocate a dual description of
the fully filled Fermi sea in terms of hadrons, and make a phenomenological
hypothesis for the equation of state of this matter. We then proceed to an
example where the mean field interactions are all vector and only associated
with the nucleons, ignoring the effects of mass change associated with the
scalar interactions. Except for the effects of Pauli blocking, the nucleons and
quarks do not interact. To get a reasonable transition to Quarkyonic matter the
interaction of the quarks among themselves are assumed to be non-perturbative,
and a simple phenomenological relation between quark Fermi energy and density
is introduced.

challenging. This work used optically patterned electrodes on a photoconductive
substrate using a digital micromirror device (DMD) to dynamically control the
region of movement of self-propelling particles (i.e. metallo-dielectric Janus
particles (JPs)). This extends previous studies where only a passive micromotor
was optoelectronically manipulated with a translocating optical pattern that
illuminated the particle. In contrast, the current system used the optically
patterned electrode merely to define the region within which the JPs moved
autonomously. Interestingly, the JPs avoided crossing the optical region edge,
which enables constraint of the area of motion and to dynamically shape the JP
trajectory. Using the DMD system to simultaneously manipulate several JPs
enabled to self-assemble the JPs into stable active structures (JPs ring) with
precise control over the number of participating JPs and passive particles.
Since the optoelectronic system is amenable to closed-loop operation using
real-time image analysis, it enables exploitation of these active particles as
active microrobots that can be operated in a programmable and parallelized

In this work, we propose a new method for finding interpretable metamodels. Our
approach utilizes Kolmogorov superposition theorem, which expresses
multivariate functions as a composition of univariate functions (our primitive
parameterized functions). This composition can be represented in the form of a
tree. Inspired by symbolic regression, we use a modified form of genetic
programming to search over different tree configurations. Gradient descent (GD)
is used to optimize the parameters of a given configuration. Our method is a

potential incompleteness in requirements. [Principal ideas/results] We mask
words in requirements and have BERT's masked language model (MLM) generate
contextualized predictions for filling the masked slots. We simulate
incompleteness by withholding content from requirements and measure BERT's
ability to predict terminology that is present in the withheld content but
absent in the content disclosed to BERT. [Contribution] BERT can be configured
to generate multiple predictions per mask. Our first contribution is to
determine how many predictions per mask is an optimal trade-off between
effectively discovering omissions in requirements and the level of noise in the
predictions. Our second contribution is devising a machine learning-based
filter that post-processes predictions made by BERT to further reduce noise. We
empirically evaluate our solution over 40 requirements specifications drawn
from the PURE dataset [1]. Our results indicate that: (1) predictions made by

there is a need for efficient methods which can be used to map classical data

of quantum computers and study quantum algorithms, we need to be able to
approximate quantum operations into forms that are easier to simulate on

  Motivated by these needs, in this paper we study the approximation of
matrices and vectors by using their tensor products obtained through successive
Schmidt decompositions. We show that data with distributions such as uniform,
Poisson, exponential, or similar to these distributions can be approximated by
using only a few terms which can be easily mapped onto quantum circuits. The
examples include random data with different distributions, the Gram matrices of
iris flower, handwritten digits, 20newsgroup, and labeled faces in the wild.
And similarly, some quantum operations such as quantum Fourier transform and
variational quantum circuits with a small depth also may be approximated with a
few terms that are easier to simulate on classical computers. Furthermore, we
show how the method can be used to simplify quantum Hamiltonians: In
particular, we show the application to randomly generated transverse field
Ising model Hamiltonians. The reduced Hamiltonians can be mapped into quantum
circuits easily and therefore can be simulated more efficiently.

operations, electrically small array apertures are employed, and the signal
wavefront becomes spherical in the near-field. Therefore, near-field signal
model should be considered for channel acquisition in THz systems. Unlike prior
works which mostly ignore the impact of near-field beam-split (NB) and consider
either narrowband scenario or far-field models, this paper introduces both a
model-based and a model-free techniques for wideband THz channel estimation in
the presence of NB. The model-based approach is based on orthogonal matching
pursuit (OMP) algorithm, for which we design an NB-aware dictionary. The key
idea is to exploit the angular and range deviations due to the NB. We then
employ the OMP algorithm, which accounts for the deviations thereby ipso facto
mitigating the effect of NB. We further introduce a federated learning
(FL)-based approach as a model-free solution for channel estimation in a
multi-user scenario to achieve reduced complexity and training overhead.
Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

considering two different scenarios: i) `BD-$\Lambda$CDM', in which a rigid
cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, is included, thus constituting a BD version
of the vanilla concordance $\Lambda$CDM model (the current standard model of
cosmology with flat three-dimensional geometry), and ii) `BD-RVM', a
generalization of i) in which the vacuum energy density (VED),
$\rho_{\textrm{vac}}$, is a running quantity evolving with the square of the
Hubble rate: $\delta\rho_{\textrm{vac}}(H)\propto \nu\, m^2_{\textrm{Pl}}
(H^2-H_0^2)$ (with $|\nu|\ll 1$). This dynamical scenario is motivated by
recent studies of quantum field theory (QFT) in curved spacetime, which lead to
the running vacuum model (RVM). We solve the background as well as the
perturbation equations for each cosmological model and test their performance
against the modern wealth of cosmological data, namely a compilation of the
latest SNIa+$H(z)$+BAO+LSS+CMB observations. We utilize the AIC and DIC
statistical information criteria in order to determine if they can fit better
the observations than the concordance model. The two BD extensions are tested
by considering three different datasets. According to the AIC and DIC criteria,
both BD extensions i) and ii) are competitive, but the second one (the BD-RVM
scenario) is particularly favored when it is compared with the vanilla model.
This fact may indicate that the current observations favor a mild dynamical
evolution of the Newtonian coupling $G_N$ as well as of the VED. This is in
agreement with recent studies suggesting that the combination of these two
features can be favorable for a possible resolution of the $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$
tensions. In this work, we show that the Brans-Dicke theory with running vacuum
has the potential to alleviate the two tensions at the same time.

electrophysiological modalities such as electroencephalography (EEG) and
transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). While high-resolution 7 Tesla
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data allows for reconstructing the cerebral
arteries with a cross-sectional diameter larger than the voxel size, the
conductivity cannot be directly inferred from MRI data. The state-of-the-art
head models applied in EEG and tES typically associate each head tissue
compartment with a constant conductivity, omitting any dynamical effects of
cerebral circulation. Incorporating those effects poses the challenge of
solving a system of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) in a
realistic multi-compartment head model.
  Methods: We propose that circulation in the distinguishable arteries can be
estimated via the pressure Poisson equation (PPE). To establish a fluid
exchange model between arteries and microarteries, a boundary condition derived
from the Hagen-Poisseuille model is applied. The relationship between the
estimated blood concentration and the tissue conductivity is approximated
through Archie's law for fluid flow in porous media.
  Results: Through the formulation of the PPE and a set of boundary conditions
based on the Hagen-Poisseuille model, we obtained an equivalent formulation of
the incompressible NSEs. Thus, allowing effective blood pressure estimation in
cerebral arteries segmented from open 7 Tesla MRI data.
  Conclusions: We developed and built a useful modeling framework that accounts
for the effects of dynamic blood flow on a novel MRI-based conductivity atlas.

functional theory (LR-TDDFT) calculation of the dynamic density response
function of warm dense matter in an adiabatic approximation that can be used
with any available exchange-correlation (XC) functional across Jacob's Ladder
and across temperature regimes. The main novelty of the presented approach is
that it can go beyond the adiabatic local density approximation (ALDA) and
generalized LDA (AGGA) while preserving the self-consistence between the
Kohn-Sham (KS) response function and adiabatic XC kernel for extended systems.
The key ingredient for the presented method is the combination of the adiabatic
XC kernel from the direct perturbation approach with the macroscopic dynamic KS
response from the standard LR-TDDFT method using KS orbitals. We demonstrate
the application of the method for the example of warm dense hydrogen, for which
we perform a detailed analysis of the KS density response function, the RPA
result, the total density response function and of the adiabatic XC kernel. The
analysis is performed using LDA, GGA, and meta-GGA level approximations for the
XC effects. The presented method is directly applicable to disordered systems

agents learn from expert demonstrations while interacting with the environment,
which favors GAIL on tasks for which a reward signal is difficult to derive. In
this work, the hGAIL architecture was proposed to solve the autonomous
navigation of a vehicle in an end-to-end approach, mapping sensory perceptions
directly to low-level actions, while simultaneously learning mid-level input
representations of the agent's environment. The proposed hGAIL consists of an
hierarchical Adversarial Imitation Learning architecture composed of two main
modules: the GAN (Generative Adversarial Nets) which generates the Bird's-Eye

the vehicle, and the GAIL which learns to control the vehicle based mainly on
the BEV predictions from the GAN as input.Our experiments have shown that GAIL
exclusively from cameras (without BEV) fails to even learn the task, while
hGAIL, after training, was able to autonomously navigate successfully in all

discuss the effects of boundary conditions on the evolution of the gas fraction
in a small-sized galaxy (tidal radius of about 1 kpc), like classical
spheroidal galaxies in the Local Group. We found that open boundaries with
sizes smaller than approximately 10 times the characteristic radius of the
galactic dark-matter halo become unappropriated for this kind of simulation
after about 0.6 Gyr of evolution, since they act as an infinity reservoir of
gas due to dark-matter gravity. We also tested two different boundary
conditions that avoid gas accretion from numerical frontiers: closed and
selective boundary conditions. Our results indicate that the later condition
(that uses a velocity threshold criterion to open or close frontiers) is
preferable since minimizes the number of reversed shocks due to closed
boundaries. Although the strategy of putting computational frontiers as far as
possible from the galaxy itself is always desirable, simulations with selective
boundary condition can lead to similar results at lower computational costs.

available observations are the aggregates across all sub-populations. Method #1
is a dictionary-based approach, which begins with a large number of pre-defined
sub-population models (each with its own starting time, shape, etc), then
determines the (positive) weight of small (learned) number of sub-populations.
Method #2 is a mixture-of-$M$ fittable curves, where $M$, the number of
sub-populations to use, is given by the user. Both methods are compatible with
any parametric model; here we demonstrate their use with first (a)~Gaussian

separately analyze this problem in two distinct settings, grounding our work in
a state-of-the-art DP mechanism for large-scale query answering: the Relaxed
Adaptive Projection (RAP) mechanism.
  The first setting is a classic setting in DP literature where all queries are
known to the mechanism in advance. Within this setting, we identify challenges
in the RAP mechanism's original analysis, then overcome them with an enhanced
implementation and analysis. We then extend the capabilities of the RAP
mechanism to be able to answer a more general and powerful class of queries
(r-of-k thresholds) than previously considered. Empirically evaluating this
class, we find that the mechanism is able to answer orders of magnitude larger
sets of queries than prior works, and does so quickly and with high utility.
  We then define a second setting motivated by real-world considerations and
whose definition is inspired by work in the field of machine learning. In this
new setting, a mechanism is only given partial knowledge of queries that will
be posed in the future, and it is expected to answer these future-posed queries
with high utility. We formally define this setting and how to measure a
mechanism's utility within it. We then comprehensively empirically evaluate the
RAP mechanism's utility within this new setting. From this evaluation, we find
that even with weak partial knowledge of the future queries that will be posed,
the mechanism is able to efficiently and effectively answer arbitrary queries
posed in the future. Taken together, the results from these two settings
advance the state of the art on differentially private large-scale query
answering.

need for careful curation of notifications sent to users of these different
types. In this work, we study a novel centralized approach for notification
optimization, where we view the opportunities to send user notifications as
items and types of notifications as buyers in an auction market. Furthermore,
the auction setup is unique, and the platform has the ability to subsidize the
bids from the notification types.
  Using tools from fair division, we study the application of competitive
equilibrium for addressing this problem. We show that an Eisenberg-Gale-style
convex program allows us to find an allocation that is fair to all notification
types in hindsight. Using the dual of the formulation, we present an online
algorithm that allocates notifications via first-price auctions using a
pacing-multiplier approach. Secondly, we introduce an approach based on
second-price auctions and pacing, which has the benefit of working well with
existing advertising systems built for second-price auctions.
  Through an A/B test in production, we show that the second price-based
auction system improves over a decentralized notification optimization system,
leading to its launch in production for some Instagram notifications. Further,
through simulations on Instagram notification data and a subsequent production
A/B test, we compare the outcomes of first-price and second-price auctions and
show that the former has more stable pacing multipliers.

facial animation retargeting, exhibiting higher accuracy of the fit and
sparser, more interpretable weight vector compared to SOTA. The proposed method
targets a specific subdomain of human face animation - highly-realistic
blendshape models used in the production of movies and video games. In this
paper, we formulate an optimization problem that takes into account all the
requirements of targeted models. Our objective goes beyond a linear blendshape
model and employs the quadratic corrective terms necessary for correctly
fitting fine details of the mesh. We show that the solution to the proposed
problem yields highly accurate mesh reconstruction even when general-purpose
solvers, like SQP, are used. The results obtained using SQP are highly accurate
in the mesh space but do not exhibit favorable qualities in terms of weight
sparsity and smoothness, and for this reason, we further propose a novel
algorithm relying on a MM technique. The algorithm is specifically suited for
solving the proposed objective, yielding a high-accuracy mesh fit while
respecting the constraints and producing a sparse and smooth set of weights
easy to manipulate and interpret by artists. Our algorithm is benchmarked with
SOTA approaches, and shows an overall superiority of the results, yielding a
smooth animation reconstruction with a relative improvement up to 45 percent in
root mean squared mesh error while keeping the cardinality comparable with
benchmark methods. This paper gives a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics
that cover different aspects of the solution, including mesh accuracy, sparsity
of the weights, and smoothness of the animation curves, as well as the
appearance of the produced animation, which human experts evaluated.

we encode the simulated paintings and input sounds into the same latent space.
For speech, we decouple speech into its transcribed text and the tone of the

emotions from the tone to guide the mood of the painting. Our approach has been
fully integrated with FRIDA, a robotic painting framework, adding sound and

techniques to mitigate mis-fitting. The former allows us to leverage
hand-crafted motor primitives for task execution which side-steps the DAgger

$O(n\log{}T)$, where $n$ is the dimension and $T$ is the number of prediction
rounds (treating all other quantities as constants and assuming $T$ is
sufficiently large), and is attainable via the well-known Online Newton Step
algorithm (ONS). However, ONS requires on each iteration to compute a
projection (according to some matrix-induced norm) onto the feasible convex
set, which is often computationally prohibitive in high-dimensional settings
and when the feasible set admits a non-trivial structure. In this work we
consider projection-free online algorithms for exp-concave and smooth losses,
where by projection-free we refer to algorithms that rely only on the
availability of a linear optimization oracle (LOO) for the feasible set, which
in many applications of interest admits much more efficient implementations
than a projection oracle. We present an LOO-based ONS-style algorithm, which
using overall $O(T)$ calls to a LOO, guarantees in worst case regret bounded by
$\widetilde{O}(n^{2/3}T^{2/3})$ (ignoring all quantities except for $n,T$).
However, our algorithm is most interesting in an important and plausible
low-dimensional data scenario: if the gradients (approximately) span a subspace
of dimension at most $\rho$, $\rho << n$, the regret bound improves to
$\widetilde{O}(\rho^{2/3}T^{2/3})$, and by applying standard deterministic
sketching techniques, both the space and average additional per-iteration
runtime requirements are only $O(\rho{}n)$ (instead of $O(n^2)$). This improves
upon recently proposed LOO-based algorithms for OCO which, while having the

virtual representations of faces can benefit greatly from their inclusion.
However, modeling the geometric and appearance interactions of glasses and the
face of virtual representations of humans is challenging. Glasses and faces
affect each other's geometry at their contact points, and also induce
appearance changes due to light transport. Most existing approaches do not
capture these physical interactions since they model eyeglasses and faces
independently. Others attempt to resolve interactions as a 2D image synthesis
problem and suffer from view and temporal inconsistencies. In this work, we
propose a 3D compositional morphable model of eyeglasses that accurately
incorporates high-fidelity geometric and photometric interaction effects. To
support the large variation in eyeglass topology efficiently, we employ a
hybrid representation that combines surface geometry and a volumetric
representation. Unlike volumetric approaches, our model naturally retains
correspondences across glasses, and hence explicit modification of geometry,
such as lens insertion and frame deformation, is greatly simplified. In
addition, our model is relightable under point lights and natural illumination,
supporting high-fidelity rendering of various frame materials, including
translucent plastic and metal within a single morphable model. Importantly, our
approach models global light transport effects, such as casting shadows between
faces and glasses. Our morphable model for eyeglasses can also be fit to novel
glasses via inverse rendering. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art
methods and demonstrate significant quality improvements.

tasks. However, many foundation models are proprietary, so users must share
their data with model owners to fine-tune the models, which is costly and raise

computation-intensive and impractical for most downstream users. In this paper,
we propose Offsite-Tuning, a privacy-preserving and efficient transfer learning
framework that can adapt billion-parameter foundation models to downstream data
without access to the full model. In offsite-tuning, the model owner sends a
light-weight adapter and a lossy compressed emulator to the data owner, who
then fine-tunes the adapter on the downstream data with the emulator's
assistance. The fine-tuned adapter is then returned to the model owner, who
plugs it into the full model to create an adapted foundation model.
Offsite-tuning preserves both parties' privacy and is computationally more
efficient than the existing fine-tuning methods that require access to the full
model weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of offsite-tuning on various
large language and vision foundation models. Offsite-tuning can achieve
comparable accuracy as full model fine-tuning while being privacy-preserving

Spectrograph on HST, giving a sample of 87 galaxies at redshift z=0.05-0.44. We
contrast the Lya spectral measurements with properties of the ionized gas (from
optical spectra) and stars (from stellar modeling). We demonstrate correlations
of unprecedented strength between the Lya escape fraction (and equivalent
width) and the ionization parameter (p~10^-15). The relative contribution of
blue-shifted emission to the total Lya also increases from ~0 to ~40% over the
range of O_32 ratios (p~10^-6). We also find particularly strong correlations
with estimators of stellar age and nebular abundance, and weaker correlations
regarding thermodynamic variables. Low ionization stage absorption lines
suggest the Lya emission and line profile are predominantly governed by the
column of absorbing gas near zero velocity. Simultaneous multi-parametric
analysis over many variables shows we can predict 80% of the variance on Lya
luminosity, and ~50% on the EW. We determine the most crucial predictive
variables, finding that for tracers of the ionization state and Hb luminosity

metric that exhibits the full non-linear constraint algebraically, in a way
that can be directly implemented for numerical simulations. Motivated by the
presence of higher order operators in the low-energy effective description of
massive gravity, we show how the inclusion of higher-order gradient
(dissipative) terms leads to a well-posed formulation of its dynamics. While
the formulation is presented for a generic combination of the minimal and
quadratic mass terms on any background, for concreteness, we then focus on the
numerical evolution of the minimal model for spherically symmetric
gravitational collapse of scalar field matter. This minimal model does not
carry the relevant interactions to switch on an active Vainshtein mechanism, at
least in spherical symmetry, thus we do not expect to recover usual GR
behaviour even for small graviton mass. Nonetheless we may ask what the outcome
of matter collapse is for this gravitational theory. Starting with small
initial data far away from the centre, we follow the matter through a
non-linear regime as it falls towards the origin. For sufficiently weak data
the matter disperses. However for larger data we generally find that the
classical evolution breaks down due to the theory becoming infinitely strongly
coupled without the presence of an apparent horizon shielding this behaviour

the combination of the enhanced density of states that accompany these

interaction driven instabilities. We present examples of single $n=3$ (monkey

We then turn to the question of what instabilities are possible when the
singularities are isolated. For spinful electrons, we find that the inclusion
of repulsive interactions destroys any isolated monkey-saddle singularity

eigenstate thermalization hypothesis -- Hamiltonians of these systems exhibit
mid-spectrum eigenstates that are equidistant in energy and which possess low
entanglement and evade thermalization for long times. We present a novel
approach for understanding the anomalous dynamical behavior in these systems.
Specifically, we postulate that QMBS Hamiltonians $H$ can generically be
partitioned into a set of terms $O_a$ which do not commute over the entire
Hilbert space, but commute to all orders within the subspace of scar states.
All states in the scar subspace thus evolve according to a `broken unitary'
$U_s(t) = \prod_a e^{-iO_at}$, where $H = \sum_a O_a$; alternatively, the scar
subspace may be viewed as being spawned by common eigenstates of all $O_a$.
While the scar Hamiltonian $H$ may be non-integrable, operators $O_a$ usually
exhibit a trivial spectrum with equidistant eigenergies which gives rise to
revivals at an appropriate period. Two classes of scar models emerge in this
picture -- those with a finite set of $O_a$, as pertaining to, for instance,
scars in the AKLT model, and those with an extensive set of such operators,
such as eta pairing scar states in the Hubbard model. Besides discussing how
well known scar models fit into the above picture, we use this dynamical
decoupling to generalize conditions under which scar subspaces can be
engendered in the two settings, generalizing constraints satisfied by
quasiparticles in the Matrix Product State (MPS) construction of scar
eigenstates, and the Shiraishi-Mori approach. We also discuss connections
between this approach and others in the literature.

realized as the worldvolume theories of stacks of $k$ giant-graviton branes. A
different expansion for the index provided by Murthy was shown to hold very
generally, but the connection to the first expansion was not immediately clear.
We study the relation between the two expansions and propose a prescription for
extracting the terms of the first series from those of the second. We follow
this prescription in the case of the $1/2$-BPS index and show that the
contribution of the $m$th term of the first expansion is fully encoded in the
first $m$ terms of the second. In addition, we identify the $m$th term of the
second expansion with the expectation value of the $N$th power of the
superdeterminant in a $U(m|m)$ superunitary matrix integral, which hints at a
brane/anti-brane origin for the term.

a luminosity of 1.9x10$^{41}$ ergs/s. The stellar continuum colors vary along
the feature, and are well-fit by a simple model that has a monotonically
increasing age with distance from the tip. The line ratios, colors, and the
overall morphology are consistent with an ejected SMBH moving through the CGM
at high speed while triggering star formation. The best-fit time since ejection

Opposite the primary wake is a fainter and shorter feature, marginally detected
in [OIII] and the rest-frame far-ultraviolet. This feature may be shocked gas
behind a binary SMBH that was ejected at the same time as the SMBH that

formation. Disks that are highly inclined, or ''edge-on'', are of particular
interest since their geometry provides a unique opportunity to study the disk's
vertical structure and radial extent. Candidate edge-on protoplanetary disks
are typically identified via their unique spectral energy distribution and
subsequently confirmed through high-resolution imaging. However, this selection
process is likely biased toward the largest, most massive disks, and the
resulting sample may not accurately represent the underlying disk population.
To investigate this, we generated a grid of protoplanetary disk models using
radiative transfer simulations and determined which sets of disk parameters
produce edge-on systems that could be recovered by aforementioned detection
techniques--i.e., identified by their spectral energy distribution and
confirmed through follow-up imaging with HST. In doing so, we adopt a
quantitative working definition of ""edge-on disks"" that is observation-driven
and agnostic about the disk inclination or other properties. Folding in
empirical disk demographics, we predict an occurrence rate of 6.2% for edge-on
disks and quantify biases towards highly inclined, massive disks. We also find
that edge-on disks are under-represented in samples of Spitzer-studied young
stellar objects, particularly for disks with M $\lesssim$ 0.5 $M_\odot$.
Overall, our analysis suggests that several dozen edge-on disks remain
undiscovered in nearby star-forming regions, and provides a universal selection
process to identify edge-on disks for consistent, population-level demographic
studies.

cleared inner hole of a debris disk, offering invaluable opportunities to study
the dynamical interaction between a substellar companion and a dusty disk. We
present the first ALMA observation of the system as well as the continued GPI
monitoring of the companion's orbit with 6 new epochs from 2016 to 2018. We
update the orbital fit and, in combination with absolute astrometry from GAIA,
place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 18.5 $M_J$ on the companion's mass. To
interpret the ALMA observations, we used radiative transfer modeling to
determine the disk properties. We find that the disk is well resolved and
nearly edge on. While the misalignment angle between the disk and the orbit is
weakly constrained due to the short orbital arc available, the data strongly
support a (near) coplanar geometry for the system. Furthermore, we find that
the models that describe the ALMA data best have an inner radius that is close
to the companion's semi-major axis. Including a posteriori knowledge of the
system's SED further narrows the constraints on the disk's inner radius and
place it at a location that is in reasonable agreement with, possibly interior
to, predictions from existing dynamical models of disk truncation by an
interior substellar companion. HR\,2562 has the potential over the next few
years to become a new testbed for dynamical interaction between a debris disk

satisfied by the photon and phonon are identical to each other. We study
optimal reciprocal transport in symmetric optomechanics. By observing the

from the Kepler mission vary randomly from orbit to orbit by up to a factor of
10 or more. We explain how chaotic outflows may arise by constructing a map for
the wind mass-loss rate as a function of time. The map is built on three
statements: (1) The wind mass-loss rate scales in proportion to the surface
equilibrium vapor pressure, rising exponentially with ground temperature. (2)
Because the wind takes a finite time to escape the planet's gravity well, the
surface mass-loss rate at any time determines the wind optical depth at a later
time -- the atmosphere has hysteresis. (3) The ground temperature increases
with optical depth (greenhouse effect) when the atmosphere is optically thin,
and decreases with optical depth when the atmosphere is optically thick
(nuclear winter). Statement (3) follows from how dust condenses in the face of
intense stellar irradiation. As discussed recently, condensates initially naked
before the star must be silicate-rich and iron-poor, staying cool enough for
condensation by absorbing weakly in the visible and emitting strongly in the
infrared. Later, when grains are numerous enough to self-shield from starlight,
they may accrete more iron and reverse their visible-to-infrared opacity ratio.
Depending on parameters, the map for the wind can regularly boom and bust
between a greenhouse and a nuclear winter, or erupt into chaos. Lyapunov times
are measured in orbital periods, the time for the wind to turn by Coriolis
forces away from the planet's dayside, out of the Hill sphere.

by computing cophenetic distance on the dendrograms, by looking at the
different clustering membership using Jaccard similarity, and by analysing the
topological diversity defined as the structural entropy. The results show that
the urban sub-national structures present high heterogeneity, while the
administrative system is highly homogeneous, replicating the same structure of
organisation across the national territory. Such contrasting organisational
structures present administrative challenges that can give rise to poor
decision-making processes and mismanagement, impairing the efficient
functioning of systems. Our results can help address these challenges,
informing how to rebalance such mismatches through planning and political
strategies that consider the complex interdependencies of territories across
scales.

($\mathcal{FRSC}$s) that are part of the consensus protocol. At the same time,
these redistribution smart contracts reward the miner of a block with a certain

log-likelihood periodograms to explore possible solutions for the period of
planet d and then follow those up with detailed TTV and RV MCMC modeling and
stability tests. We find several candidate periods for AU Mic d, all of which
are near resonances with AU Mic b and c of varying order. Based on our model
comparisons, the most-favored orbital period of AU Mic d is 12.73812+/-0.00128
days (T_{C,d}=2458333.32110+/-0.35836 BJD), which puts the three planets near a
4:6:9 mean-motion orbital resonance. The mass for d is M_d=1.013+/-0.146 M_E,
making this planet Earth-like in mass. The presence of orbital resonances in a
very young system implies that compact planetary systems can develop resonant
chains very early on, which can quickly establish the stability of the systems.
Additional TTV observation of the AU Mic system are needed to further constrain
the planetary masses, search for possible transits of AU Mic d, and detect
possible additional planets beyond AU Mic c.

with spherical symmetry by a static spacelike thin shell. We demonstrate this
issue by using two examples -- the generalized black-to-white hole bounce with
mass difference and the Schwarzschild-to-de Sitter transition. The goal is to
construct the corresponding Penrose diagrams without any explicit or implicit
illness at the thin shell. To accomplish this, we find that two coordinate
transformations are required unless a special condition is met. The first
transformation serves as the removal of the unwanted area while the second one
reconciles the two different coordinate systems on two sides of the shell by
removing an implicit discontinuity in the Penrose diagram of this type.
However, the second transformation brings a different kind of coordinate
singularity back to the event horizon. This coordinate singularity either
creates a degeneracy such that all four-vectors are in 45$\degree$, or a
degeneracy such that timelike vectors are parallel to the event horizon in the
resulting Penrose diagram. We give the geometric explanations for the
discontinuity and this special type of coordinate singularity. We also draw
comparison to the Reissner-Nordstr{\""o}m solution.

the pulsar and extending up to 5.3', with multiple kinks along the emission.
The presented radio continuum images from multi-configuration broadband VLA

quickly, and has some hot spots present along the extended radio emission.
These kinks could indicate the presence of density variation in the local ISM
or turbulence. The bow shock standoff distance estimates a small bow shock
region with a size 0.003-0.009 pc, consistent with the pulsar spin-down power
of Edot=1.51x10^35 ergs/s estimated from timing. The high-resolution radio
image reveals the presence of an asymmetry in the bow shock region which is
also present in the X-ray image. The broadband radio image shows an unusually
steep spectrum along with a flat-spectrum sheath, which could indicate varying
opacity or energy injection into the region. Spatially-resolved X-ray spectra
provide marginal evidence of synchrotron cooling along the extended tail. Our
analysis of the X-ray data also shows that this pulsar has a low spin-down

strategy space is expanded incrementally based on analysis of intermediate game
models. A common approach to strategy exploration, represented by the double
oracle algorithm, is to add strategies that best-respond to a current
equilibrium. This approach may suffer from overfitting and other limitations,
leading the developers of the policy-space response oracle (PSRO) framework for
iterative EGTA to generalize the target of best response, employing what they
term meta-strategy solvers (MSSs). Noting that many MSSs can be viewed as
perturbed or approximated versions of Nash equilibrium, we adopt an explicit
regularization perspective to the specification and analysis of MSSs. We
propose a novel MSS called regularized replicator dynamics (RRD), which simply
truncates the process based on a regret criterion. We show that RRD is more
adaptive than existing MSSs and outperforms them in various games. We extend
our study to three-player games, for which the payoff matrix is cubic in the
number of strategies and so exhaustively evaluating profiles may not be
feasible. We propose a profile search method that can identify solutions from
incomplete models, and combine this with iterative model construction using a
regularized MSS. Finally, and most importantly, we reveal that the regret of
best response targets has a tremendous influence on the performance of strategy
exploration through experiments, which provides an explanation for the
effectiveness of regularization in PSRO.

consider the abstract problem of optimally routing two modules, i.e., vehicles
that can attach to or detach from each other in motion on a graph. The modules'
objective is to reach a preset set of nodes while incurring minimum resource
costs. We assume that the resource cost incurred by an agent formed by joining
two modules is the same as that of a single module. Such a cost formulation
simplistically models the benefits of joining two modules, such as passenger
redistribution between the modules, less traffic congestion, and higher fuel
efficiency. To find an optimal plan, we propose a heuristic algorithm that uses
the notion of graph centrality to determine when and where to join the modules.
Additionally, we use the nearest neighbor approach to estimate the cost routing
for joined or separated modules. Based on this estimated cost, the algorithm
determines the subsequent nodes for both modules. The proposed algorithm is
polynomial time: the worst-case number of calculations scale as the eighth
power of the number of the total nodes in the graph. To validate its benefits,
we simulate the proposed algorithm on a large number of pseudo-random graphs,
motivated by real transportation scenario where it performs better than the
most relevant benchmark, an adapted nearest neighbor algorithm for two separate
agents, more than 85 percent of the time.

pipeline for unsupervised mapping of spectra on a mine face is proposed which
draws from several recent advances in the hyperspectral machine learning

self-supervised algorithms in a unified system to map minerals on a mine face
without the need for human-annotated training data. The pipeline is evaluated
with a hyperspectral image dataset of an open-cut mine face comprising mineral

a superior map to its constituent algorithms, and the consistency of its

to the central question of whether clinically relevant insights can be attained
from FE analysis of atrioventricular valves without precise knowledge of tissue
properties. As such we investigated 1) the influence of tissue extensibility
and 2) the effects of constitutive model parameters and leaflet thickness on
simulated valve function and mechanics. We compared metrics of valve function
(e.g., leaflet coaptation and regurgitant orifice area) and mechanics (e.g.,
stress and strain) across one normal and three regurgitant mitral valve (MV)
models with common mechanisms of regurgitation (annular dilation, leaflet
prolapse, leaflet tethering) of both moderate and severe degree. We developed a
novel fully-automated approach to accurately quantify regurgitant orifice areas

differential rotation period of a large-scale photospheric magnetic field, to
study its behavior over time and to find out whether there is a sectoral
structure of this field along the longitude. However, the choice of the
coordinate system in which to search for it is far from unambiguous. This is
closely related to the fact that the rotation of the Sun is differential in
latitude and varies with depth and over time. Based on the observational data
of the J. Wilcox Solar Observatory for three complete cycles of solar activity
21, 22 and 23, the period of rotation of the magnetic field at various

learning can be difficult due to challenges such as policy search in a large

facilitate efficient learning of complex multi-agent tasks, we propose an

trained to acquire sub-task-specific policies. The sub-teams are then merged

method which identifies situations in the target task where each agent can use
its sub-task-specific skills, and uses this information to modulate
hyperparameters for learning and exploration during the fine-tuning process. We
compare MEDoE to multi-agent reinforcement learning baselines that train from

reinforcement learning techniques for fine-tuning. We show that MEDoE
outperforms baselines which train from scratch or use na\""ive fine-tuning

decision-based material design to establish confidence in the models and
evaluate the fidelity of models. Uncertainty Propagation (UP) is a technique to
determine model output uncertainties based on the uncertainty in its input
variables. The most common and simplest approach to propagate the uncertainty
from a model inputs to its outputs is by feeding a large number of samples to
the model, known as Monte Carlo (MC) simulation which requires exhaustive
sampling from the input variable distributions. However, MC simulations are
impractical when models are computationally expensive. In this work, we
investigate the hypothesis that while all samples are useful on average, some
samples must be more useful than others. Thus, reordering MC samples and
propagating more useful samples can lead to enhanced convergence in statistics
of interest earlier and thus, reducing the computational burden of UP process.
Here, we introduce a methodology to adaptively reorder MC samples and show how
it results in reduction of computational expense of UP processes.

happening in the first few million years of a planetary system's life. Several
models predict the possibility, for these isolated planetary-mass objects, to
retain exomoons after their ejection. The tidal heating mechanism and the
presence of an atmosphere with a relatively high optical thickness may support
the formation and maintenance of oceans of liquid water on the surface of these
satellites. In order to study the timescales over which liquid water can be
maintained, we perform dynamical simulations of the ejection process and infer
the resulting statistics of the population of surviving exomoons around
free-floating planets. The subsequent tidal evolution of the moons' orbital
parameters is a pivotal step to determine when the orbits will circularize,
with a consequential decay of the tidal heating. We find that close-in ($a
\lesssim 25 $R$_{\rm J}$) Earth-mass moons with CO$_2$-dominated atmospheres
could retain liquid water on their surfaces for long timescales, depending on
the mass of the atmospheric envelope and the surface pressure assumed. Massive
atmospheres are needed to trap the heat produced by tidal friction that makes
these moons habitable. For Earth-like pressure conditions ($p_0$ = 1 bar),
satellites could sustain liquid water on their surfaces up to 52 Myr. For
higher surface pressures (10 and 100 bar), moons could be habitable up to 276
Myr and 1.6 Gyr, respectively. Close-in satellites experience habitable
conditions for long timescales, and during the ejection of the FFP remain bound
with the escaping planet, being less affected by the close encounter.

  Process starts with data collection in open-circuit wind tunnel experiment.
Furthermore, the pressure coefficient, as a comparative variable, has been used
with varying angle of attack (2, 4, 6 and 8 degrees) for both experiment and
LBM analysis. To numerically reproduce the experimental results, the LBM
coupled with the LES turbulence model, the generalized wall function (GWF) and

Also, a mesh independence study has been provided to ensure result congruence.
  The proposed LBM methodology is capable of highly accurate predictions when

is the possibility of experimental and CFD comparison for the same domain
dimensions.

and characterize maps that can push-forward efficiently a probability measure
onto another. Recent works have drawn inspiration from Brenier's theorem, which
states that when the ground cost is the squared-Euclidean distance, the
``best'' map to morph a continuous measure in $\mathcal{P}(\Rd)$ into another
must be the gradient of a convex function. To exploit that result, [Makkuva+
2020, Korotin+2020] consider maps $T=\nabla f_\theta$, where $f_\theta$ is an
input convex neural network (ICNN), as defined by Amos+2017, and fit $\theta$
with SGD using samples. Despite their mathematical elegance, fitting OT maps
with ICNNs raises many challenges, due notably to the many constraints imposed
on $\theta$; the need to approximate the conjugate of $f_\theta$; or the
limitation that they only work for the squared-Euclidean cost. More generally,
we question the relevance of using Brenier's result, which only applies to
densities, to constrain the architecture of candidate maps fitted on samples.
Motivated by these limitations, we propose a radically different approach to
estimating OT maps: Given a cost $c$ and a reference measure $\rho$, we
introduce a regularizer, the Monge gap $\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}(T)$ of a map $T$.
That gap quantifies how far a map $T$ deviates from the ideal properties we
expect from a $c$-OT map. In practice, we drop all architecture requirements
for $T$ and simply minimize a distance (e.g., the Sinkhorn divergence) between
$T\sharp\mu$ and $\nu$, regularized by $\mathcal{M}^c_\rho(T)$. We study
$\mathcal{M}^c_{\rho}$, and show how our simple pipeline outperforms
significantly other baselines in practice.

observations constrain the speed, mass-loss rate, and extent of the progenitor
wind shortly before explosion. A narrow P Cygni absorption component reveals a
progenitor wind speed of $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$. As observed in previous SNe
IIn, the intermediate-width H$\alpha$ emission became progressively more
asymmetric and blueshifted, suggesting either an asymmetric CSM, an asymmetric
explosion, or increasing selective extinction from dust within the post-shock
shell or SN ejecta. Based on the CSM radius and speed, we find that the
progenitor suffered extreme eruptive mass loss on the order of 0.1-1 M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ during the $\sim$12 years immediately preceding its death, imparting
$\sim$ 8 $\times$ 10$^{47}$ erg of kinetic energy to the CSM. Integrating its
light curve over the first 200 days after discovery, we find that ASASSN-15ua
radiated at least 3.1$\times$10$^{50}$ erg in visual light alone, giving a
lower limit to the total radiated energy that may have approached 10$^{51}$
erg. ASASSN-15ua exhibits many similarities to two well-studied superluminous

approach to quantum cosmology. The scalar field potential is assumed to have a
maximum at $\phi=0$ and can be approximated in its vicinity as $V(\phi)\approx
3H^{2}-\frac{1}{2}m^{2}\phi^{2}$. Using the instanton method, we find that for

homogeneous, spherical de Sitter space. For larger values of $m/H$, the most
probable tunneling is to an inhomogeneous closed universe with a domain wall
wrapped around its equator. We determine the quantum state of the field $\phi$
in the nucleated universe by solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation with tunneling

a novel communication-efficient federated hypergradient estimator via

show that the proposed AggITD-based algorithm achieves the same sample
complexity as existing approximate implicit differentiation (AID)-based
approaches with much fewer communication rounds in the presence of data
heterogeneity. Our results also shed light on the great advantage of ITD over
AID in the federated/distributed hypergradient estimation. This differs from
the comparison in the non-distributed bilevel optimization, where ITD is less
efficient than AID. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the great
effectiveness and communication efficiency of the proposed method.

surrogates predictive of the response from multiple local sites to assist the
training with labeled data and largely improve statistical efficiency. It first
extracts a preliminary supervised estimator to realize convex training of a
regularized single index model for the surrogate at each local site and then
aggregates the fitted local models for accurate learning of the target outcome
model. It protects individual-level information from the local sites through
summary-statistics-based data aggregation. We show that under mild conditions,
our method attains substantially lower estimation error rates than the

non-radial motion of outflowing structures close to the Sun (<3.0 Rs). In this
work, we describe a method to mitigate these challenges by generating
non-radial Height-Time profiles of outflows by using advanced image processing
techniques. The North and South boundaries of a large equatorial streamer
during the 2008 solar minimum were identified in STEREO/SECCHI solar images,
using two different methodologies based on thresholds of brightness and
piece-wise polynomial function fitting. To address line-of-sight issues, we
used tomographic reconstruction of the 3D distribution of the coronal electron
density based on SECCHI/COR2 images. Spectral analysis of the time series of
the position angle of the streamer boundary revealed its oscillatory nature at
some heights at 36-48 hours and 10.5-14.6 hours. Dividing the distance between
the North and South streamer boundaries in equal parts at each height, we
obtained non-radial Height-Time paths from which we generated non-radial

uninterruptedly from the Sun in EUVI, through COR1 and into COR2. Finally, we

necessary? We study the use of different amounts of text data, both for
creating a lexicon that constrains ASR decoding to possible words (e.g. *dogz

probable word sequences (e.g. too dogs vs. two dogs). We perform experiments
using 10 minutes of transcribed speech from English (for replicating prior
work) and two additional pairs of languages differing in the availability of
supplemental text data: Gronings and Frisian (~7.5M token corpora available),
and Besemah and Nasal (only small lexica available). For all languages, we
found that using only a lexicon did not appreciably improve ASR performance.
For Gronings and Frisian, we found that lexica and language models derived from
'novel-length' 80k token subcorpora reduced the word error rate (WER) to 39% on
average. Our findings suggest that where a text corpus in the upper tens of
thousands of tokens or more is available, fine-tuning a transformer model with

backdoor attacks remain largely a hypothetical threat, state-of-the-art
defenses require massive changes to the existing ML pipelines and are too

  In this paper, we take a pragmatic view and investigate natural resistance of
ML pipelines to backdoor attacks, i.e., resistance that can be achieved without

Mithridates, a new method that helps practitioners answer two actionable

(2) how can I increase its resistance without changing the training pipeline?
Mithridates leverages hyperparameter search $\unicode{x2013}$ a tool that ML
developers already extensively use $\unicode{x2013}$ to balance the model's
accuracy and resistance to backdoor learning, without disruptive changes to the

When mid-infrared light is used for driving and the period of light field is
comparable to the scattering time in metals, unique light-driven states and
nonlinear optical responses associated with the scattering process are expected
to occur. Here, we use high-harmonics spectroscopy to investigate the effect of
electron-electron scattering on the electron dynamics in thin film 2H-NbSe$_2$
driven by a mid-infrared field. We observed odd-order high harmonics up to 9th
order as well as a broadband emission from hot electrons in the energy range
from 1.5 to 4.0 eV. The electron-electron scattering time in NbSe$_2$ was
estimated from the broadband emission to be almost the same as the period of
the mid-infrared light field. A comparison between experimental results and a
numerical calculation reveals that a kind of resonance between scattering and
driving enhances the non-perturbative behavior of high harmonics in metals,
causing a highly non-equilibrium electronic state corresponding to several
thousand Kelvin.

small hitting set of all its maximum stable sets.
  More generally, let us say a class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs is $\eta$-bounded

$\eta(G)\leq h(\omega(G))$ for every graph $G\in \mathcal{C}$, where $\eta(G)$

to be polynomially $\eta$-bounded if in addition $h$ can be chosen to be a
polynomial.
  We introduce $\eta$-boundedness inspired by a question of Alon and motivated
by a number of meaningful similarities to $\chi$-boundedness. In particular, we
propose an analogue of the Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s-Sumner conjecture, that the class of
all $H$-free graphs is $\eta$-bounded if (and only if) $H$ is a forest. Like
$\chi$-boundedness, the case where $H$ is a star is easy to verify, and we
prove two non-trivial extensions of this: $H$-free graphs are $\eta$-bounded if
(1) $H$ has a vertex incident with all edges of $H$, or (2) $H$ can be obtained
from a star by subdividing at most one edge, exactly once.
  Unlike $\chi$-boundedness, the case where $H$ is a path is surprisingly hard.
Our main result mentioned at the beginning shows that $P_5$-free graphs are
$\eta$-bounded. The proof is rather involved compared to the classical
``Gy\'{a}rf\'{a}s path'' argument which establishes, for all $t$, the
$\chi$-boundedness of $P_t$-free graphs. It remains open whether $P_t$-free
graphs are $\eta$-bounded for $t\geq 6$. It also remains open whether
$P_5$-free graphs are polynomially $\eta$-bounded, which, if true, would imply
the Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal conjecture for $P_5$-free graphs. But we prove that
$H$-free graphs are polynomially $\eta$-bounded if $H$ is a proper induced

methods, such as BFGS, SR-1, are well-known for their impressive practical
performance. However, they may be slower than gradient descent for general
convex functions, with the best theoretical rate of $O(k^{-1/3})$. This gap
between impressive practical performance and poor theoretical guarantees was an
open question for a long period of time. In this paper, we make a significant
step to close this gap. We improve upon the existing rate and propose the Cubic
Regularized Quasi-Newton Method with a convergence rate of $O(k^{-1})$. The key
to achieving this improvement is to use the Cubic Regularized Newton Method
over the Damped Newton Method as an outer method, where the Quasi-Newton update
is an inexact Hessian approximation. Using this approach, we propose the first
Accelerated Quasi-Newton method with a global convergence rate of $O(k^{-2})$

precision of the approximation, we achieve a global convergence rate of
$O(k^{-3})$, which is faster than any first-order method. To make these methods
practical, we introduce the Adaptive Inexact Cubic Regularized Newton Method

Several tools exist for simulating and tracing pollutant transport throughout

can be computationally intensive, require significant amounts of data to be
developed, and require expert knowledge for their use (ultimately limiting
application scope). In this work, we present a graph modeling framework --

capturing connectivity and for identifying upstream pollutant sources and for
tracing downstream impacts within small and large hydrological systems.
Moreover, the graph representation can facilitate the use of advanced

proximity-induced mutual coupling between close-by RIS elements; ii)
reverberation-induced long-range coupling between all RIS elements.
Mathematically, this ""structural"" non-linearity originates from the inversion

Simulations show that the proposed DRL algorithms give the UAV with strong
resistance against jamming and that the TD3 algorithm exhibits faster and
smoother convergence than the DDPG algorithm, and suits better for larger RISs.
This DRL-based approach eliminates the need for knowledge of the channels

parameterization is crucial in enabling efficient shape optimization as it
allows for optimizing complex shapes using only a few design variables. Recent
approaches often utilize CAD data in conjunction with spline-based methods
where the spline's control points serve as design variables. Consequently,
these approaches rely on the same design variables as specified by the human
designer. While this choice is convenient, it either restricts the design to
small modifications of given, initial design features - effectively prohibiting
topological changes - or yields undesirably many design variables. In this
work, we step away from CAD and spline-based approaches and construct an

relied on liquids, foams or cellular structures, whereas its applicability has
yet to be explored in nano-scale solid films. Here, we observed a variant
Plateau law in networks of atomically thin domes made of solid two-dimensional
(2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Discrete layer-dependent van der
Waals (vdWs) interaction energies were experimentally and theoretically
obtained for domes protruding in different TMD layers. Significant surface
tension differences from layer-dependent vdWs interaction energies manifest in
a variant of this fundamental law. Meanwhile, the remarkable mechanical
properties, gas impermeability and interlayer vdWs interaction energy of TMD
films enable domes and the networks to sustain high gas pressure and exist in a
fundamentally variant nature for several years. Our findings pave the way
towards exploring variant discretised states with applications in
opto-electro-mechanical devices.

successfully quantify the amount of carbon dioxide removed by ERW at scale, MRV

mass-balance-based method where metal analysis on soil samples is used to track
the extent of in-situ alkaline mineral weathering. We show that signal-to-noise
issues of in-situ soil analysis can be mitigated by using isotope-dilution mass
spectrometry to reduce analytical error. We implement a proof of concept
experiment demonstrating the method in controlled mesocosms. In our experiment,
basalt feedstock is added to soil columns containing the cereal crop Sorghum
bicolor at a rate equivalent to 50 t ha-1. Using our approach, we calculate an
average initial CDR value of 1.47 +- 1.09 tCO2eq ha-1 from our experiments

conventional elemental budgeting of reaction products. Our method provides a
robust time-integrated estimate of initial CDR, to feed into models that track

modelling the distribution of observed cluster mass for a given true mass to be
log-normal and adopting a selection threshold in the observed mass $M_{200m}
\geq 0.836 \times 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, we find about $4.1 \times 10^{5}$
clusters in the redshift range $0 \leq z \leq 1.5$ can be detected by the CSST.
We construct the Fisher matrix for the cluster number counts from CSST, and
forecast constraints on dark energy parameters for models with constant
($w_0$CDM) and time dependent ($w_0w_a$CDM) equation of state. In the
self-calibration scheme, the dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$ of
$w_0$CDM model can be constrained to $\Delta w_0 = 0.036$. If $w_a$ is added as
a free parameter, we obtain $\Delta w_0 = 0.077$ and $\Delta w_a = 0.39$ for
the $w_0w_a$CDM model, with a Figure of Merit for ($w_0,w_a$) to be 68.99.
Should we had perfect knowledge of the observable-mass scaling relation
(``known SR"" scheme), we would obtain $\Delta w_0 = 0.012$ for $w_0$CDM model,
$\Delta w_0 = 0.062$ and $\Delta w_a = 0.24$ for $w_0w_a$CDM model. The dark
energy Figure of Merit of ($w_0,w_a$) increases to 343.25. By extending the
maximum redshift of the clusters from $z_{max} \sim 1.5$ to $z_{max} \sim 2$,
the dark energy Figure of Merit for ($w_0,w_a$) increases to 89.72
(self-calibration scheme) and 610.97 (``known SR"" scheme), improved by a factor
of $\sim 1.30$ and $\sim 1.78$, respectively. We find that the impact of
clusters' redshift uncertainty on the dark energy constraints is negligible as
long as the redshift error of clusters is smaller than 0.01, achievable by
CSST. We also find that the bias in logarithm mass must be calibrated to be
$0.30$ or better to avoid significant dark energy parameter bias.

shapes of the background of an object can improve the recognition accuracy of
the object in the scene. Semantic context (e.g. a keyboard on an empty desk vs.
a keyboard next to a desktop computer ) will improve accuracy and exclude

the time or location of an images captured, can also help to decide whether
certain event or action should occur. Other types of context (e.g. 3D structure
of a building) will also provide additional information to improve the

we study an $L^1$ based mixed DG method for second-order elliptic equations in

linearization of fully nonlinear PDEs. Due to the nature of the equations,
classical finite element methods based on variational forms can not be employed

Convergence analysis in both energy norm and $L^{\infty}$ norm are obtained

therefore invalidate traditional gradient methods. Therefore all existing
gradient based solvers are no longer feasible under this setting. To overcome
this difficulty, we characterize solutions of $L^1$ optimization as
fixed-points of proximity equations and utilize matrix splitting technique to
obtain a class of fixed-point proximity algorithms with convergence analysis.
Various numerical examples are displayed to illustrate the numerical solution

exploit the time series shapelets to extract prominent local patterns and
perform interpretable sequence discretization to distill the whole-series

into short and discrete token sequences, where both local patterns and global
contexts are well preserved. Moreover, to alleviate the label sparsity issue, a
multi-scale transformation strategy is adaptively designed to augment data and

square, in the presence of the magnetic field, will become negative somewhere
outside the horizon for either sign of the coupling constant $\alpha$, thus
triggering the tachyonic instability and leading to spontaneous scalarization

the Hessian estimation procedure from the Hessian Eigenmaps algorithm to
approximate the spline loss when the true manifold is unknown. This yields a

quasars (FSRQs), BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), gamma-ray Narrow-line Seyfert 1

(1) The slope indices of the relation between $P_{\rm jet}$ and $L^{\rm int}$
are $0.85\pm0.01$ for the whole sample, $0.70\pm0.02$ for the FSRQs,
$0.83\pm0.03$ for the BL Lacs, $0.68\pm0.11$ for the $\gamma$NLS1s, and
$0.93\pm0.09$ for the radio galaxies, respectively. The jets in $\gamma$NLS1s

$0.92\pm0.18$ for the $\gamma$NLS1s, respectively. The $\gamma$NLS1s and radio
galaxies almost also follow the $L^{\rm int}$-$L_{\rm disk}$ correlation
derived for Fermi blazars. (3) The jet power is larger than the luminosity of
accretion disks for almost all jetted AGN. Jet power depends on both the
Eddington ratio and black hole mass. We obtain $\log P_{\rm

(FOV) from some images captured from different viewing positions. To solve the
problem of fusion ghosting in the stitched image, seam-driven methods avoid the
misalignment area to fuse images by predicting the best seam. Currently, as
standard tools of the OpenCV library, dynamic programming (DP) and GraphCut
(GC) are still the only commonly used seam prediction methods despite the fact
that they were both proposed two decades ago. However, GC can get excellent
seam quality but poor real-time performance while DP method has good efficiency
but poor seam quality. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based seam
prediction method (DSeam) for the sake of high seam quality with high
efficiency. To overcome the difficulty of the seam description in network and
no GroundTruth for training we design a selective consistency loss combining
the seam shape constraint and seam quality constraint to supervise the network
learning. By the constraint of the selection of consistency loss, we implicitly
defined the mask boundaries as seams and transform seam prediction into mask
prediction. To our knowledge, the proposed DSeam is the first deep learning
based seam prediction method for image stitching. Extensive experimental
results well demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed Dseam method
which is 15 times faster than the classic GC seam prediction method in OpenCV

Therefore, the existing MTL models designed for RS suffer from negative
transfer to different degrees, which will injure optimization in MTL. We find
that the root cause of negative transfer is feature redundancy that features
learned for different tasks interfere with each other. To alleviate the issue
of negative transfer, we propose a novel multi-task learning method termed
Feature Decomposition Network (FDN). The key idea of the proposed FDN is
reducing the phenomenon of feature redundancy by explicitly decomposing
features into task-specific features and task-shared features with carefully
designed constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method
on two datasets, a synthetic dataset and a public datasets (i.e., Ali-CCP).
Experimental results show that our proposed FDN can outperform the

bimodality in the mass distribution of our classified S0s, from which we find
two separate S0s populations: high-mass S0s, which are mostly red and
quiescent; and low-mass S0s, which are generally bluer and include both passive

motions. The motion is predicted so that it accomplishes a task from the
initial state observed in the given image. While our method evaluates the task
achievability by the Energy-Based Model (EBM), previous EBMs are not designed
for evaluating the consistency between different domains (i.e., image and
motion in our method). Our method seamlessly integrates the image and motion
data into the image feature domain by spatially-aligned temporal encoding so
that features are extracted along the motion trajectory projected onto the
image. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a data-driven motion optimization
method, Deep Motion Optimizer (DMO), that works with EBM for motion prediction.
Different from previous gradient-based optimizers, our self-supervised DMO
alleviates the difficulty of hyper-parameter tuning to avoid local minima. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with a variety of
experiments with similar SOTA methods.

calculations by $N^{-1}$ extrapolations over correlation energy calculations of
different system sizes ($N$), where the $N^{-1}$ scaling comes from the total
energy. However, previous studies in the quantum Monte Carlo community suggest
an exchange-energy-like power law of $N^{-2/3}$ is also be present in the
correlation energy when using the conventional Coulomb interaction. The
rationale for this is that the total energy goes as $N^{-1}$ and the exchange
energy as $N^{-2/3}$; so, the correlation energy should be a combination of the
two power laws. Further, in coupled cluster theory, these power laws are
related to the low $G$ scaling of the transition structure factor, $S(G)$,
which is a property of the coupled cluster wavefunction calculated from the
amplitudes. We show that data from coupled cluster doubles calculations on the
uniform electron gas(UEG) fit a function with a low $G$ behavior of $S(G)$~$G$.
The pre-factor for this linear term is derived from the exchange energy to be
consistent with an $N^{-2/3}$ power law at large $N$. Incorporating the
exchange structure factor into the transition structure factor results in a
combined structure factor of $S(G)$~$G^2$, consistent with an $N^{-1}$ scaling
of the exchange-correlation energy. We then look for the presence of an
$N^{-2/3}$ power law in the energy. First, we develop a plane-wave cutoff
scheme with less noise than the traditional basis set used for the UEG. Then,
we collect data from a wide range of electron numbers and densities to
systematically test 5 methods using $N^{-1}$ scaling, $N^{-2/3}$ scaling, or
combinations of both scaling behaviors. We find that power laws that
incorporate both $N^{-1}$ and $N^{-2/3}$ scaling perform better than either
alone, especially when the pre-factor for $N^{-2/3}$ scaling can be found from
exchange energy calculations.

machine learning. Recently, there have been several efforts to study if, and
how, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) acting in the absence of hardware noise can
be overparametrized. In particular, it has been proposed that a QNN can be
defined as overparametrized if it has enough parameters to explore all
available directions in state space. That is, if the rank of the Quantum Fisher
Information Matrix (QFIM) for the QNN's output state is saturated. Here, we
explore how the presence of noise affects the overparametrization phenomenon.
Our results show that noise can ""turn on"" previously-zero eigenvalues of the
QFIM. This enables the parametrized state to explore directions that were
otherwise inaccessible, thus potentially turning an overparametrized QNN into
an underparametrized one. For small noise levels, the QNN is
quasi-overparametrized, as large eigenvalues coexists with small ones. Then, we
prove that as the magnitude of noise increases all the eigenvalues of the QFIM
become exponentially suppressed, indicating that the state becomes insensitive
to any change in the parameters. As such, there is a pull-and-tug effect where
noise can enable new directions, but also suppress the sensitivity to parameter
updates. Finally, our results imply that current QNN capacity measures are
ill-defined when hardware noise is present.

Despite the potential benefits, the generation and detection of these particles

method for producing high-energy vortex electrons and $\gamma$-photons by
colliding relativistic electrons with circularly polarized laser pulses in the
radiation-dominated quantum electrodynamics (QED) regime. We use the
laser-dressed vortex state to develop a nonlinear scattering theory, which
allows us to understand the transfer of spin angular momenta (SAM) to intrinsic
OAM in the highly nonlinear multi-photon process. The theory shows that
electrons in the vortex state carry higher intrinsic OAM when
radiation-reaction becomes significant, with the central OAM number
proportional to the amount of energy taken by the $\gamma$-photon. This study
provides an effective approach to generating high-energy vortex electron beams
using laser intensities that are currently achievable. Additionally, the
emission spectra of energetic electrons in vortex states are found to exhibit
multi-peaks, which sets them apart from plane-wave electrons and makes them

To bridge the performance gap between our different capacities models, we
meticulously design the mask decay, which transforms the large model's

regularization loss is proposed to mitigate shortcomings of $L_p$
regularization. Our algorithm significantly narrows the performance gap by 50%

scalable encoder for neural image compression. The encoding complexity is
dynamic to meet different latency requirements. We propose decaying the large

challenging and has never been addressed due to its prohibitively large and
complex solution space. Our framework decouples the AUA from the power control
and RIS beamforming (PCRB) based on the different natures of their variables,
hence reducing the solution space. A new position-adaptive binary particle
swarm optimization (PABPSO) method is designed for the AUA. Two twin-delayed
deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) models with new and refined state
pre-processing layers are developed for the PCRB. Another important aspect is
that a DT is leveraged to train the learning framework with its replay of
channel estimates stored. The AUA, power control, and RIS beamforming are only
tested in the physical environment at the end of selected epochs. Simulations
show that using RISs contributes to considerable increases in the sum-rate of
UCCF systems, and the DT dramatically reduces overhead with marginal
performance loss. The proposed framework is superior to its alternatives in

transition. Focusing on this point, we extend the study of adiabatic flames,
which assumes zero temperature gradient at the burned-side edge of a flame
front, to the case of non-zero temperature gradient by introducing compression
zone behind the front. Such a treatment has been performed in the previous work
based on the ignition temperature approximation. In that case, the effect of
gas compression on flames was described by asymptotic solutions with respect to
small squared Mach numbers: for example, in the compression zone, inner
solutions are expressed by use of Lambert $W$ function. However, due to the aim
of obtaining analytical solutions inside a flame front, the temperature
dependence of reaction term was ignored and, as a result, the cold boundary
difficulty was not treated seriously. This issue is resolved in this study by
use of large activation energy asymptotics with the reaction term expressed by
the Arrhenius type. The temperature distribution is computed numerically in the
reaction zone and calculated analytically in the compression zone. The
burning-rate eigenvalue problem is also considered to derive a formula of
laminar flame speed, which is coupled with differential equation for
temperature in the reaction zone. Then, the dependence of laminar flame speed
on thermal-diffusive parameters, accompanied with hydrodynamic properties
brought by the compression effect, becomes clear. The non-zero gradient
condition of temperature on the burned side of a flame front is obtained for
non-zero values of Mach number.

highlighting the essential role of molecular chirality in inducing
unconventional superconductivity. The robust half-flux quantum phase shift

under opposite supercurrent, with a relative phase difference approaching the
unity of {\pi} at below 0.5 K, further supporting topologically non-trivial

LT-PLL, suffers from a fundamental dilemma: LT methods build upon a given class

fact that the constant rebalancing in LT is harsh to the label disambiguation

method constructs a dynamic adjustment that is benign to the label

  learning","18 pages, 14 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work aims at finding optimal navigation policies for thin, deformable
microswimmers that progress in a viscous fluid by propagating a sinusoidal
undulation along their slender body. These active filaments are embedded in a
prescribed, non-homogeneous flow, in which their swimming undulations have to
compete with the drifts, strains, and deformations inflicted by the outer
velocity field. Such an intricate situation, where swimming and navigation are
tightly bonded, is addressed using various methods of reinforcement learning.
Each swimmer has only access to restricted information on its configuration and
has to select accordingly an action among a limited set. The optimisation
problem then consists in finding the policy leading to the most efficient
displacement in a given direction. It is found that usual methods do not
converge and this pitfall is interpreted as a combined consequence of the
non-Markovianity of the decision process, together with the highly chaotic
nature of the dynamics, which is responsible for high variability in learning
efficiencies. Still, we provide an alternative method to construct efficient
policies, which is based on running several independent realisations of
Q-learning. This allows the construction of a set of admissible policies whose
properties can be studied in detail and compared to assess their efficiency and
robustness.

handle various graph-related tasks. It has attracted considerable research
interest to study deep GCNs, due to their potential superior performance
compared with shallow ones. However, simply increasing network depth will, on
the contrary, hurt the performance due to the over-smoothing problem. Adding
residual connection is proved to be effective for learning deep convolutional
neural networks (deep CNNs), it is not trivial when applied to deep GCNs.
Recent works proposed an initial residual mechanism that did alleviate the
over-smoothing problem in deep GCNs. However, according to our study, their
algorithms are quite sensitive to different datasets. In their setting, the
personalization (dynamic) and correlation (evolving) of how residual applies
are ignored. To this end, we propose a novel model called Dynamic evolving
initial Residual Graph Convolutional Network (DRGCN). Firstly, we use a dynamic
block for each node to adaptively fetch information from the initial
representation. Secondly, we use an evolving block to model the residual
evolving pattern between layers. Our experimental results show that our model
effectively relieves the problem of over-smoothing in deep GCNs and outperforms
the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on various benchmark datasets. Moreover, we
develop a mini-batch version of DRGCN which can be applied to large-scale data.
Coupling with several fair training techniques, our model reaches new SOTA
results on the large-scale ogbn-arxiv dataset of Open Graph Benchmark (OGB).

non-trivial structure beyond nearest-neighbor distances. Recent observations
have upended this view and demonstrated that the microstructure in liquids is
surprisingly rich and plays a critical role in numerous physical, biological,
and industrial processes. However, approaches to uncover this structure are
either system-specific or yield results that are not physically intuitive.
Here, through single-particle resolved three-dimensional confocal microscope
imaging and the use of a recently introduced four-point correlation function,
we show that bidisperse colloidal liquids have a highly non-trivial structure
comprising alternating layers with icosahedral and dodecahedral order, which
extends well-beyond nearest-neighbor distances and grows with supercooling. By
quantifying the dynamics of the system on the particle level, we establish that
it is this intermediate-range order, and not the short-range order, which has a
one-to-one correlation with dynamical heterogeneities, a property directly
related to the relaxation dynamics of glassy liquids. Our experimental findings
provide a direct and much sought-after link between the structure and dynamics
of liquids and pave the way for probing the consequences of this
intermediate-range order in other liquid state processes.

system reliability, and thereby, automated troubleshooting is crucial.
Effective root cause localization after anomaly detection is crucial for
ensuring the reliability of microservice systems. However, two significant
issues rest in existing approaches: (1) Microservices generate traces, system
logs, and key performance indicators (KPIs), but existing approaches usually
consider traces only, failing to understand the system fully as traces cannot
depict all anomalies; (2) Troubleshooting microservices generally contains two
main phases, i.e., anomaly detection and root cause localization. Existing
studies regard these two phases as independent, ignoring their close
correlation. Even worse, inaccurate detection results can deeply affect
localization effectiveness. To overcome these limitations, we propose Eadro,
the first end-to-end framework to integrate anomaly detection and root cause
localization based on multi-source data for troubleshooting large-scale
microservices. The key insights of Eadro are the anomaly manifestations on
different data sources and the close connection between detection and
localization. Thus, Eadro models intra-service behaviors and inter-service
dependencies from traces, logs, and KPIs, all the while leveraging the shared
knowledge of the two phases via multi-task learning. Experiments on two
widely-used benchmark microservices demonstrate that Eadro outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin. The results also show the
usefulness of integrating multi-source data. We also release our code and data

fusion network with 3D convolution (named AFCF3D-Net) is proposed in this
article. First, through the inner fusion property of 3D convolution, we design
a new feature fusion way that can simultaneously extract and fuse the feature

between low-level features and high-level features, we propose an
adjacent-level feature cross-fusion (AFCF) module to aggregate complementary

contribution to this work is twofold. First, we propose domain diversification,
which diversifies the limited training data using different audio data
augmentation methods. We then propose the concept of maximally diversity-aware
cascaded augmentations and optimize the augmentation fold-factor for effective
diversification of the training data. Second, we introduce the idea of domain
generalization considering the augmentation methods as pseudo-domains. Towards
this, we investigate both domain-invariant and domain-aware approaches. Our LID
system is based on the state-of-the-art emphasized channel attention,
propagation, and aggregation based time delay neural network (ECAPA-TDNN)
architecture. We have conducted extensive experiments with three widely used
corpora for Indian LID research. In addition, we conduct a final blind
evaluation of our proposed methods on the Indian subset of VoxLingua107 corpus
collected in the wild. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed domain
diversification is more promising over commonly used simple augmentation
methods. The study also reveals that domain generalization is a more effective
solution than domain diversification. We also notice that domain-aware learning
performs better for same-corpora LID, whereas domain-invariant learning is more
suitable for cross-corpora generalization. Compared to basic ECAPA-TDNN, its
proposed domain-invariant extensions improve the cross-corpora EER up to 5.23%.
In contrast, the proposed domain-aware extensions also improve performance for
same-corpora test scenarios.

find that the coupling to collective modes, i.e., the phonon, dramatically
alters the electrons self-energy and renormalizes the Fermi velocity of the

the low-energy dispersion and electron dynamics highly nonequivalent along the

issue in such a field is that the existing gradient-type scheme can easily get

initializing the algorithm and finally degraded positioning performance if the
starting point is inappropriately selected. In this paper, we develop a
collaborative gradient projection (GP) algorithm in order to globally solve the
highly nonconvex QP-based TDOA HF localization problem. The metaheuristic of
particle swarm optimization (PSO) is exploited for information sharing among
multiple GP models, each of which is guaranteed to work out a critical point
solution to the simplified maximum likelihood formulation. Random mutations are
incorporated to avoid the early convergence of PSO. Rather than treating the
geolocation of HF transmitter as a pure optimization problem, we further
provide workarounds for addressing the possible impairments and challenges when
the proposed technique is applied in practice. Numerical results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our PSO-assisted re-initialization strategy in achieving
the global optimality, and the superiority of our method over its competitor in

if $\delta T > 0$ and $f =-1$ if $\delta T < 0$, where $\delta T$ stands for
the fluctuation of $T$. Then, it is assumed that behind the appearance of these

Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequalities are proved for these fluctuation
temperatures measured by COBE in the different sky directions. The calculation
of these inequalities from the actual temperature measurements shows that these
inequalities are not violated. This result cannot be anticipated by calculating
the commutators of the cosmic density quantum operators. This must be remarked
here since, in the case of a system of two entangled spin ${\textstyle{1 \over
2}}$ particles, its CHSH inequalities violation can be inferred from the
nonvanishing value of the corresponding spin measurement commutators. The above
nonviolation of the observed cosmic CHSH inequalities is compatible with the
existence of local realism behind the cosmic measurement results. Nevertheless,
assuming again local realism, some new cosmic CHSH inequalities can be derived
for the case of the WMAP measurements whose accuracy is better than the one of
the above considered COBE measurements. More specifically, in the WMAP case,
some significant cross correlations between the temperature and polarization
maps are detected, and the new cosmic CHSH inequalities are the ones built with
these cross correlations. Now, the occasional violation of these CHSH
inequalities would mean the failure of the assumed local realism in accordance
with the quantum origin of the primordial temperature and polarization
fluctuations in the framework of standard inflation.

planning. We find that LLMs are able to leverage commonsense knowledge and
reasoning to furnish missing details from under-specified goals (as is often
the case in natural language). However, our experiments also reveal that LLMs
can fail to generate goals in tasks that involve numerical or physical (e.g.,
spatial) reasoning, and that LLMs are sensitive to the prompts used. As such,
these models are promising for translation to structured planning languages,

  optimization: A continuous perspective",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-material design optimization problems can, after discretization, be
solved by the iterative solution of simpler sub-problems which approximate the
original problem at an expansion point to first order. In particular, models
constructed from convex separable first order approximations have a long and
successful tradition in the design optimization community and have led to
powerful optimization tools like the prominently used method of moving
asymptotes (MMA). In this paper, we introduce several new separable
approximations to a model problem and examine them in terms of accuracy and
fast evaluation. The models can, in general, be nonconvex and are based on the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix identity on the one hand, and on the
mathematical concept of topological derivatives on the other hand. We show a
surprising relation between two models originating from these two -- at a first
sight -- very different concepts.
  Numerical experiments show a high level of accuracy for two of our proposed
models while also their evaluation can be performed efficiently once enough
data has been precomputed in an offline phase. Additionally it is demonstrated
that suboptimal decisions can be avoided using our most accurate models.

them into glasses is a long-standing question of condensed-matter. Most popular
theories posit that the dynamics becomes cooperative as the temperature
decreases: many events must occur in a coordinated fashion on a growing length
scale for relaxation to occur. Instead, other approaches consider that local
barriers associated with the elementary rearrangement of a few particles or
`excitations' govern the dynamics. Here we resolve this conundrum by
introducing a new algorithm, SEER, that can systematically extract hundreds of
excitations and their energy from any given configuration. Remarkably, we find
at low temperatures that the excitation density of states is essentially
shifted to higher energy under cooling. This observation directly predicts how
local barriers slow down the dynamics, assuming no cooperative effects. We test
this prediction in numerical super-cooled liquids using swap algorithms,
allowing us to measure the relaxation time up to milliseconds. The agreement is
quantitative, revealing that cooperative effects are absent and leading to new
perspectives on the glass transition.

proposed. This method leverages the theoretical strengths of unsupervised
learning and the data availability of both normal and abnormal classes. The AD
is often formulated as an unsupervised task motivated by the frequent
imbalanced nature of the datasets, as well as the challenge of capturing the
entirety of the abnormal class. Such methods only rely on normal images during
training, which are devoted to be reconstructed through an autoencoder
architecture for instance. However, the information contained in the abnormal
data is also valuable for this reconstruction. Indeed, the model would be able
to identify its weaknesses by better learning how to transform an abnormal (or
normal) image into a normal (or abnormal) image. Each of these tasks could help
the entire model to learn with higher precision than a single normal to normal
reconstruction. To address this challenge, the proposed method utilizes
Cycle-Generative Adversarial Networks (Cycle-GANs) for abnormal-to-normal
translation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
Cycle-GANs have been studied for this purpose. After an input image has been
reconstructed by the normal generator, an anomaly score describes the
differences between the input and reconstructed images. Based on a threshold
set with a business quality constraint, the input image is then flagged as
normal or not. The proposed method is evaluated on industrial and medical
images, including cases with balanced datasets and others with as few as 30
abnormal images. The results demonstrate accurate performance and good
generalization for all kinds of anomalies, specifically for texture-shaped
images where the method reaches an average accuracy of 97.2% (85.4% with an
additional zero false negative constraint).

adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified
batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which
calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than
using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e.,
conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch
statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift.
However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on
impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn
from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show
critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify
that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time
normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the
importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of
each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains
across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation
scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that
rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that
adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art
performance in various standard benchmarks.

potential depends explicitly on time to efficiently approximate the transient

transient dynamics regime to learn the proposed model parameters. In
particular, we parameterize the coarse-grained potential both with respect to
the pair distance of the CG particles and the time, and we obtain an evolution
model that is explicitly time-dependent. Moreover, we follow a data-driven
approach to estimate the friction kernel, given by appropriate correlation
functions directly from the underlying all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.
To explore and validate the proposed methodology we study a benchmark system of
a moving particle in a box. We examine the suggested model's effectiveness in
terms of the system's correlation time and find that the model can approximate
well the transient time regime of the system, depending on the correlation time
of the system. As a result, in the less correlated case, it can represent the
dynamics for a longer time interval. We present an extensive study of our
approach to a realistic high-dimensional water molecular system. Posing the
water system initially out of thermal equilibrium we collect trajectories of
all-atom data for the, empirically estimated, transient time regime. Then, we
infer the suggested model and strengthen the model's validity by comparing it

any other heuristic modeling assumptions. A growing, adaptively refined mesh
accurately captures all details of the laser beam motion. Critically, the fine
spatial resolution required for resolved scan tracks in combination with the
high scan velocities underlying these processes mandates the use of
comparatively small time steps to resolve the underlying physics. Explicit time
integration schemes are well-suited for this setting, while unconditionally
stable implicit time integration schemes are employed for the interlayer cool
down phase governed by significantly larger time scales. These two schemes are
combined and implemented in an efficient fast operator evaluation framework
providing significant performance gains and optimization opportunities. The
capabilities of the novel framework are demonstrated through realistic AM
examples on the centimeter scale including the first scan-resolved simulation
of the entire NIST AM Benchmark cantilever specimen, with a computation time of
less than one day. Apart from physical insights gained through these simulation
examples, also numerical aspects are thoroughly studied on basis of weak and
strong parallel scaling tests. As potential applications, the proposed thermal
PBF simulation framework can serve as a basis for microstructure and
thermo-mechanical predictions on the part-scale, but also to assess the
influence of scan pattern and part geometry on melt pool shape and temperature,
which are important indicators for well-known process instabilities.

models with broken symmetry in the inflation Lagrangian. A cluster consists of
the most massive central black hole surrounded by many smaller black holes.
Similar to single primordial black holes, clusters can form gravitationally
bounded pairs and merge during their orbital evolution. The replacement of
single black holes by such clusters significantly changes the entire merger
process and the final rate of gravitational wave bursts in some parameter
ranges (with sufficiently large cluster radii). A new important factor is the
tidal gravitational interaction of the clusters. It leads to an additional
dissipation of the orbital energy, which is transferred into the internal
energy of the clusters or carried away by black holes flying out of the
clusters. Comparison with the data of gravitational-wave telescopes allows one
to constrain the fractions of primordial black holes in clusters, depending on
their mass and compactness. Even the primordial black hole fraction in the
composition of dark matter $\simeq1$ turns out to be compatible with LIGO/Virgo
observational data, if the black holes are in clusters.

  This paper proposes an appropriate probability model for the Bell experiment.
This model has only two simultaneously observable detector settings per

with both quantum mechanics and experiments. In this model the expectation for
a particular pair of observations is partial to the selected detector settings.
This leads to a slightly different variant of the Bell inequality, one that is
consistent with both quantum mechanics and measurements. In this model there is
no Bell contradiction.

distribution (or more generally a non-negative vector) and its variants have

To sample a random element $i$ in proportion to its positive weight $v_i$, the
Gumbel-Max Trick first computes a Gumbel random variable $g_i$ for each
positive weight element $i$, and then samples the element $i$ with the largest
value of $g_i+\ln v_i$. Recently, applications including similarity estimation
and weighted cardinality estimation require to generate $k$ independent
Gumbel-Max variables from high dimensional vectors. However, it is
computationally expensive for a large $k$ (e.g., hundreds or even thousands)
when using the traditional Gumbel-Max Trick. To solve this problem, we propose
a novel algorithm, FastGM, which reduces the time complexity from $O(kn^+)$ to
$O(k \ln k + n^+)$, where $n^+$ is the number of positive elements in the
vector of interest. FastGM stops the procedure of Gumbel random variables
computing for many elements, especially for those with small weights. We
perform experiments on a variety of real-world datasets and the experimental
results demonstrate that FastGM is orders of magnitude faster than

breathing disorder. It is caused by an increased upper airway resistance during
sleep, which determines episodes of partial or complete interruption of
airflow. The detection and treatment of OSAS is particularly important in
stroke patients, because the presence of severe OSAS is associated with higher
mortality, worse neurological deficits, worse functional outcome after
rehabilitation, and a higher likelihood of uncontrolled hypertension. The gold
standard test for diagnosing OSAS is polysomnography (PSG). Unfortunately,
performing a PSG in an electrically hostile environment, like a stroke unit, on
neurologically impaired patients is a difficult task; also, the number of
strokes per day outnumbers the availability of polysomnographs and dedicated
healthcare professionals. Thus, a simple and automated recognition system to
identify OSAS among acute stroke patients, relying on routinely recorded vital
signs, is desirable. The majority of the work done so far focuses on data
recorded in ideal conditions and highly selected patients, and thus it is
hardly exploitable in real-life settings, where it would be of actual use. In
this paper, we propose a convolutional deep learning architecture able to
reduce the temporal resolution of raw waveform data, like physiological
signals, extracting key features that can be used for further processing. We
exploit models based on such an architecture to detect OSAS events in stroke
unit recordings obtained from the monitoring of unselected patients. Unlike
existing approaches, annotations are performed at one-second granularity,
allowing physicians to better interpret the model outcome. Results are
considered to be satisfactory by the domain experts. Moreover, based on a

Temperature Scale of 1990; laboratory observations of a proxy steel plate were
made; initial measurement of nuclear material storage containers were made;
then a deployment to an inactive store was demonstrated. For this technique to
be feasible, uncertainties less than 10$^\circ$C would be required.
  During the laboratory calibration of an uncooled and cooled thermal imager

Geometric Algebra (CGA) to represent rotations and translations with a single
mathematical object, the motor, for camera pose regression. We do so starting
from PoseNet, which successfully predicts camera poses from small datasets of
RGB frames. State-of-the-art methods, however, require expensive tuning to
balance the orientational and translational components of the camera pose.This
is usually done through complex, ad-hoc loss function to be minimized, and in
some cases also requires 3D points as well as images. Our approach has the
advantage of unifying the camera position and orientation through the motor.
Consequently, the network searches for a single object which lives in a
well-behaved 4D space with a Euclidean signature. This means that we can
address the case of image-only datasets and work efficiently with a simple loss
function, namely the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and ground
truth motors. We show that it is possible to achieve high accuracy camera pose
regression with a significantly simpler problem formulation. This 1D-Up

resolution increases the computational effort. Here, we present the SpArta
method for rigorous optimization of regionally resolved energy systems by
Spatial Aggregation and decomposition. SpArta significantly reduces
computational effort while maintaining the full spatial resolution of
sector-coupled energy systems. SpArta first reduces problem size by spatially
aggregating the energy system using clustering. The aggregated problem is then
relaxed and restricted to obtain a lower and an upper bound. The spatial
resolution is iteratively increased until the difference between upper and
lower bound satisfies a predefined optimality gap. Finally, each cluster of the
aggregated problem is redesigned at full resolution. For this purpose, SpArta
decomposes the original synthesis problem into subproblems for each cluster.
Combining the redesigned cluster solutions yields an optimal feasible solution
of the full-scale problem within a predefined optimality gap. SpArta thus
optimizes large-scale energy systems rigorously with significant reductions in
computational effort. We apply SpArta to a case study of the sector-coupled
German energy system, reducing the computational time by a factor of 7.5,
compared to the optimization of the same problem at full spatial resolution. As
SpArta shows a linear increase in computational time with problem size, SpArta
enables computing larger problems allowing to resolve energy system designs
with improved accuracy.

  configurations","18 pages, 13 figures, submitted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  LiteBIRD is a planned JAXA-led CMB B-mode satellite experiment aiming for
launch in the late 2020s, with a primary goal of detecting the imprint of
primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Its current baseline focal-plane
configuration includes 15 frequency bands between 40 and 402 GHz, fulfilling
the mission requirements to detect the amplitude of gravitational waves with
the total uncertainty on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $\delta r$, down to
$\delta r<0.001$. A key aspect of this performance is accurate astrophysical
component separation, and the ability to remove polarized thermal dust emission
is particularly important. In this paper we note that the CMB frequency
spectrum falls off nearly exponentially above 300 GHz relative to the thermal
dust SED, and a relatively minor high frequency extension can therefore result
in even lower uncertainties and better model reconstructions. Specifically, we
compare the baseline design with five extended configurations, while varying
the underlying dust modeling, in each of which the HFT (High-Frequency
Telescope) frequency range is shifted logarithmically towards higher
frequencies, with an upper cutoff ranging between 400 and 600 GHz. In each
case, we measure the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ uncertainty and bias using both
parametric and minimum-variance component-separation algorithms. When the
thermal dust sky model includes a spatially varying spectral index and
temperature, we find that the statistical uncertainty on $r$ after foreground
cleaning may be reduced by as much as 30--50 % by extending the upper limit of
the frequency range from 400 to 600 GHz, with most of the improvement already
gained at 500 GHz. We also note that a broader frequency range leads to better
ability to discriminate between models through higher $\chi^2$ sensitivity.

characterizing free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs). FFPs could have
exomoons rotating them. In this work, we study the probability of realizing
these systems (i.e., free-floating moon-planet ones) through microlensing
observations. These systems make mostly close caustic configurations with a
considerable finite-source effect. We investigate finite-source microlensing
light curves owing to free-floating moon-planet systems. We conclude that
crossing planetary caustics causes an extensive extra peak at light curves'
wing that only changes its width if the source star does not cross the central
caustic. If the source trajectory is normal to the moon-planet axis, the
moon-induced perturbation has a symmetric shape with respect to the
magnification peak, and its light curve is similar to a single-lens one with a
higher finite-source effect. We evaluate the \wfirst~efficiency for realizing
moon-induced perturbations, which is $\left[0.002-0.094\right]\%$ by assuming a
log-uniform distribution for moon-planet mass ratio in the range
$\in\left[-9,~-2\right]$. The highest detection efficiency (i.e., $\simeq
0.094\%$) happens for Saturn-mass planets when moon-planet distance is $\sim 43
R_{\rm p}$, where $R_{\rm p}$ is the Saturn radius. Enhancing planetary mass
extends the event's time scale and decreases the finite-source effect, but it
reduces the projected moon-planet distance normalized to the Einstein radius
$s(R_{\rm E})$ which in turn decreases the size of planetary caustics and takes
them away from the host planet's position in close caustic configurations.

states with high probability. The robot motion is modeled as a Markov Decision

robotic task is specified as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas over these

Furthermore, to tackle the computational complexity, we propose a hierarchical

abstraction with constrained optimization. It synthesizes simultaneously two
dependent motion policies: the outbound policy minimizes the overall cost of
satisfying the task with a high probability, while the return policy ensures
the safe-return constraints. The problem formulation is versatile regarding the
robot model, task specifications and safety constraints. The proposed
hierarchical algorithm is more efficient and can solve much larger problems

oscillatory integrals. We show that in the regime $a\ll k^{-1}\ll L$, where $a$
denotes the size of cavity, $k$ is the compressional wavenumber $\kp$ or shear
wavenumber $\ks$, and $L$ is the minimal distance between the cavities, each
cavity gives rise to five significant eigenvalues and the corresponding
eigenfunction generates an incident wave focusing selectively on that cavity.
Numerical experiments are given to verify the theoretical result.

topography. Two different regimes exist which are studied separately using the
surface quasi-geostrophic equations. First, when the modon propagates in the
opposite direction to topographic Rossby waves, steady solutions exist and a
semi-analytical method is presented for calculating these solutions. Second,
when the modon propagates in the same direction of the Rossby waves, a wave
wake is generated. This wake removes energy from the modon causing it to decay
slowly. Asymptotic predictions are presented for this decay and found to agree
closely with numerical simulations. Over long times, decaying vortices are
found to break down due to an asymmetry resulting from the generation of waves
inside the vortex. A monopolar vortex moving along a wall is shown to behave in
a similar way to a dipole, though the presence of the wall is found to
stabilise the vortex and prevent the long-time breakdown. The problem is
mathematically equivalent to a dipolar vortex moving along a density front
hence our results apply directly to this case.

solar energy. Since most of the produced energy from distributed renewable
sources arises as electricity, electrification of energy consumers and
producers, called prosumers, expands. In this context, multi-modal distribution
grids make use of the storage capabilities of other energy sectors like heat,
and abolish the supply-dependency and uncertainty of the feed-in of
decentralized generators. This provides flexibility in the energy system, which
increases security of supply and at the same time ensures economical energy
provision. The subject of this paper is to exploit the flexibility of such a
multi-modal energy system for operation in an optimal way. The cellular
approach serves here as the energy system architecture. Aim is to provide
flexibility with a cell by optimally distributing a flexibility request to
subordinate prosumers changing their active and reactive power. The load change
is hereby to be optimally dispatched to the different components of the
prosumers under consideration of technical restrictions and dynamic behavior of
components, the grids and economical aspects. For dynamic modelling and
simulation the open-source modelling language Modelica is used. Using a
low-voltage benchmark model expanded by multi-modal technologies, the proposed

neutrino (with eV-scale mass) on the determination of cosmological parameters.
If it is detected, it will be necessary to include it into the $\Lambda \rm
CDM$ model with the fixed values of its mass $m_{\rm s}$ and mixing angle
$\theta_{s}$, which is the main method used through this paper. Apart from
that, the seesaw mechanism requires there to be at least two sterile states,
one of them being much heavier than the active ones. The heavier sterile state
($m_{s}\sim1$ keV) would decay and increase the effective number of active
neutrinos. Therefore, the influence of a change in the effective number of
relativistic neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ was studied as well, which could be
caused by, for example, the decay processes of the above-mentioned sterile
neutrinos, as well as processes leading to an increase in the temperature of
relic neutrinos $T_{\rm C\nu B}$. The effects studied in this work lead to a
significant change in the estimates of the cosmological parameters, including
the value of $H_{0}$. It has been discovered that the accounting of the sterile
neutrino with masses $m=1$ and $2.7$ eV leads to a decrease in the estimate of
the current Hubble parameter value $H_{0}$ and, therefore, exacerbates the
``$H_{0}$-tension'' problem. An increase in the value of the effective number
of relativistic neutrino species leads, on the contrary, to an increase in the
$H_{0}$ estimate, resolving the above-mentioned problem at $N_{\rm
eff}=3.0+0.9$, which is equivalent to an increase of the neutrino temperature
up to $T ^{\,0}_{\rm C\nu B}=1.95+0.14\,\rm K$. At the same time, the rest of
the cosmological parameters do not change significantly, leaving us within the
framework of the standard $\Lambda \rm CDM$ model.

luminosity (H$\beta$ $R_{\rm BLR}\unicode{x2013}L$) provides a practical
alternative yet is subject to large scatter and systematic bias. Based on the
relation between the continuum emitting region size and luminosity ($R_{\rm

estimator via continuum RM (CRM) by comparing $R_{\rm CER}$ and $R_{\rm BLR}$,
assuming that the continuum lags are dominated by the diffuse continuum
emission. Using a sample of 21 AGNs, we find a tight $R_{\rm

$R_{\rm BLR}$ is larger than $R_{\rm CER}$ at 5100 \r{A} by an average factor

the existing H$\beta$ $R_{\rm BLR}\unicode{x2013}L$ relation well and the
estimated CRM BH masses are consistent with the RM/single-epoch BH masses using

bulk Pb (7.22 K) and higher than that of MgB$_2$ (39 K). The high $T_c$ can be
attributed to the strong electron-phonon coupling (EPC) strength of 2.45, which
arises from hydrogen implantation in lead that induces several high-frequency
optical phonon modes with a relatively large phonon linewidth resulting from H
atom vibration. The metallic-bonding in perovskite Pb$_4$H not only improves
the structural stability but also guarantees better ductility than the widely

Statistical methods are often used to compensate for this disadvantage. Yet,
their ability for local explanations, and in particular for global

Restructuring is due to a preference for boundaries to shift their tilt axis
across the (1-10) plane towards [112] and ultimately to form low energy [112]
core shifted boundaries (CSBs). However, the observed geometry of these
emergent boundaries is not reproduced by atomic calculations and the driving
force is still controversial due to inconsistencies between the computational
continuum analysis and atomic calculations. Here, using atomic calculations
that involve a methodical shift of the dislocation core, we confirmed the core
shift of emergent boundaries observed in experiment and reconciled the atomic
calculations with the elastic analysis through the inclusion of a straight

offers the ability to understand the algorithm in detail, and modify or extend

sedimentary environments and processes, including alluvial, fluvial,
turbiditic, carbonatic, deep-sea clastic, wave action, vertical tectonics and
sea-level changes. These processes can be run concurrently. Furthermore, the
effect of some processes can be made to affect others (for example wave action
can affect carbonate growth, while also causing erosion and redistribution of
the deposits). The algorithms are fully deterministic. As most forward models
of natural environments, the results cannot be readily conditioned to data.
However, the model is much faster than similar commercial packages of the same

center-stable manifold is a small divisor in a quadratic source term of the
perturbation equation. This singularity is due to the threshold resonance of
the linearized operator and the absence of null structure in the nonlinearity.
The threshold resonance of the linearized operator produces a one-dimensional
space of slowly decaying Klein-Gordon waves, relative to local norms. In
contrast, the closely related perturbation equation for the sine-Gordon kink
does exhibit null structure, which makes the corresponding quadratic source
term amenable to normal forms [74].
  The main result of this work establishes decay estimates up to exponential

information for tens of millions of galaxies over $15\,000$ deg$^2$ of the sky
in the redshift range $0.9\leq z<1.8$. We do this using simulated measurements
obtained from the Flagship mock catalogue, the official Euclid mock that
closely matches the expected properties of the spectroscopic data set. To
mitigate anisotropic selection-bias effects, we use a velocity field
reconstruction method to remove large-scale redshift-space distortions from the
galaxy field before void-finding. This allows us to accurately model
contributions to the observed anisotropy of the cross-correlation function
arising from galaxy velocities around voids as well as from the
Alcock-Paczynski effect, and we study the dependence of constraints on the
efficiency of reconstruction. We find that Euclid voids will be able to
constrain the ratio of the transverse comoving distance $D_{\rm M}$ and Hubble
distance $D_{\rm H}$ to a relative precision of about $0.3\%$, and the growth
rate $f\sigma_8$ to a precision of between $5\%$ and $8\%$ in each of four

model, this translates to a statistical uncertainty
$\Delta\Omega_\mathrm{m}=\pm0.0028$ on the matter density parameter from voids,

changes across disorders. While the field is progressing towards large-scale

the single-subject risk assessment capability essential for clinical
application. In order to enable the clinical use of brain-age as a biomarker,
we here combine uncertainty-aware deep Neural Networks with conformal
prediction theory. This approach provides statistical guarantees with respect
to single-subject uncertainty estimates and allows for the calculation of an
individual's probability for accelerated brain-aging. Building on this, we show
empirically in a sample of N=16,794 participants that 1. a lower or comparable
error as state-of-the-art, large-scale brain-age models, 2. the statistical
guarantees regarding single-subject uncertainty estimation indeed hold for
every participant, and 3. that the higher individual probabilities of
accelerated brain-aging derived from our model are associated with Alzheimer's

as they might provide a viable path towards solving fluid dynamics problems on
quantum computers once this emerging compute technology has matured and
fault-tolerant many-qubit systems become available. The major challenge in
developing a start-to-end quantum algorithm for the Boltzmann equation consists
in encoding relevant data efficiently in quantum bits (qubits) and formulating
the streaming, collision and reflection steps as one comprehensive unitary
operation. The current literature on quantum Boltzmann methods mostly proposes
data encodings and quantum primitives for individual phases of the pipeline
assuming that they can be combined to a full algorithm.
  In this paper we disprove this assumption by showing that for encodings
commonly discussed in literature either the collision or the streaming step
cannot be unitary. Building on this landmark result we propose a novel encoding
in which the number of qubits used to encode the velocity depends on the number
of time steps one wishes to simulate, with the upper bound depending on the
total number of grid points.
  In light of the non-unitarity result established for existing encodings, our
encoding method is to the best of our knowledge the only one currently known
that can be used for a start-to-end quantum Boltzmann solver where both the
collision and the streaming step are implemented as a unitary operation.
Furthermore our theoretical unitarity result can serve as a guideline on which
types of encodings to consider or whether a `stop-and-go' method with repeated
measurements and re-initializations is the method of choice.

approach, which we call TurboTLS, the initial client-to-server and
server-to-client flows of the TLS handshake are sent over UDP rather than TCP.
At the same time, in the same flights, the three-way TCP handshake is carried
out. Once the TCP connection is established, the client and server can complete
the final flight of the TLS handshake over the TCP connection and continue
using it for application data. No changes are made to the contents of the TLS
handshake protocol, only its delivery mechanism. We avoid problems with UDP
fragmentation by using request-based fragmentation, in which the client sends
in advance enough UDP requests to provide sufficient room for the server to fit
its response with one response packet per request packet. Clients can detect
which servers support this without an additional round trip, if the server
advertises its support in a DNS HTTPS resource record. Experiments using our
software implementation show substantial latency improvements. On reliable
connections, we effectively eliminate a round trip without any noticeable cost.
To ensure adequate performance on unreliable connections, we use lightweight
packet ordering and buffering; we can have a client wait a very small time to
receive a potentially lost packet (e.g., a fraction of the RTT observed for the
first fragment) before falling back to TCP without any further delay, since the
TCP connection was already in the process of being established. This approach
offers substantial performance improvements with low complexity, even in
heterogeneous network environments with poorly configured middleboxes.

substrates and catalysts are well mixed (WM) throughout the system. Although
this is often applicable to test-tube experimental conditions, it is not
realistic in cellular environments, where biomolecules can undergo
liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and form condensates, leading to
important functional outcomes, including the modulation of catalytic action.
Similar processes may also play a role in protocellular systems, like primitive
coacervates, or in membrane-assisted prebiotic pathways. Here we explore
whether the de-mixing of catalysts could lead to the formation of
micro-environments that influence the kinetics of a linear (multi-step)
reaction pathway, as compared to a WM system. We implemented a general lattice
model to simulate LLPS of an ensemble of different catalysts and extended it to
include diffusion and a sequence of reactions of small substrates. We carried
out a quantitative analysis of how the phase separation of the catalysts
affects reaction times depending on the affinity between substrates and
catalysts, the length of the reaction pathway, the system size, and the degree
of homogeneity of the condensate. A key aspect underlying the differences
reported between the two scenarios is that the scale invariance observed in the
WM system is broken by condensation processes. The main theoretical
implications of our results for mean-field chemistry are drawn, extending the
mass action kinetics scheme to include substrate initial hitting times to reach
the catalysts condensate. We finally test this approach by considering open
non-linear conditions, where we successfully predict, through microscopic
simulations, that phase separation inhibits chemical oscillatory behaviour,
providing a possible explanation for the marginal role that this complex
dynamic behaviour plays in real metabolisms.

along two important axes: (i) security hardening, which aims to enhance LMs'
reliability in generating secure code, and (ii) adversarial testing, which
seeks to evaluate LMs' security at an adversarial standpoint. We address both
of these by formulating a new security task called controlled code generation.
The task is parametric and takes as input a binary property to guide the LM to
generate secure or unsafe code, while preserving the LM's capability of
generating functionally correct code. We propose a novel learning-based
approach called SVEN to solve this task. SVEN leverages property-specific
continuous vectors to guide program generation towards the given property,
without modifying the LM's weights. Our training procedure optimizes these
continuous vectors by enforcing specialized loss terms on different regions of
code, using a high-quality dataset carefully curated by us. Our extensive

generates secure code for 59.1% of the time. When we employ SVEN to perform

propose a hybrid learning-based framework for generating target-cordial robotic
motion to approach a person, consisting of a learning-from-demonstration module

severe performance drops due to popularity distribution shifts, where these
changes are ubiquitous and inevitable in real-world scenarios. Unfortunately,
most leading popularity debiasing strategies, rather than tackling the
vulnerability of CF models to varying popularity distributions, require prior
knowledge of the test distribution to identify the degree of bias and further
learn the popularity-entangled representations to mitigate the bias.
Consequently, these models result in significant performance benefits in the
target test set, while dramatically deviating the recommendation from users'
true interests without knowing the popularity distribution in advance. In this
work, we propose a novel learning framework, Invariant Collaborative Filtering
(InvCF), to discover disentangled representations that faithfully reveal the
latent preference and popularity semantics without making any assumption about
the popularity distribution. At its core is the distillation of unbiased
preference representations (i.e., user preference on item property), which are
invariant to the change of popularity semantics, while filtering out the
popularity feature that is unstable or outdated. Extensive experiments on five
benchmark datasets and four evaluation settings (i.e., synthetic long-tail,
unbiased, temporal split, and out-of-distribution evaluations) demonstrate that
InvCF outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of popularity
generalization ability on real recommendations. Visualization studies shed
light on the advantages of InvCF for disentangled representation learning. Our
codes are available at https://github.com/anzhang314/InvCF.

predefined codebooks, codeword-to-class assignments are traditionally
overlooked, and codewords are implicitly assigned to classes arbitrarily. Our
paper shows that these assignments play a major role in the performance of ECC.
Specifically, we examine similarity-preserving assignments, where similar
codewords are assigned to similar classes. Addressing a controversy in existing
literature, our extensive experiments confirm that similarity-preserving
assignments induce easier subproblems and are superior to other assignment

We study the ultrafast charge carrier dynamics in Cs3Bi2I9 nanosheets using a

pump energies higher than their bandgap, and the results are interpreted in
terms of hot carrier generation (<1 ps), thermalization with local phonons (~1

facilitate exquisite measurements of cosmological expansion history, but
improvements in accuracy and precision are hindered by observational biases. Of
particular concern is the apparent difference in the corrected brightnesses of
SNe Ia in different host galaxy environments. SNe Ia in more massive, passive,
older environments appear brighter after having been standardized by their
light-curve properties. The luminosity difference commonly takes the form of a
step function. Recent works imply that environmental characteristics that trace
the age of the stellar population in the vicinity of SNe show the largest
steps. Here we use simulations of SN Ia populations to test the impact of using
different tracers and investigate promising new models of the step. We test
models with a total-to-selective dust extinction ratio $R_V$ that changes
between young and old SN Ia host galaxies, as well as an intrinsic luminosity
difference between SNe from young and old progenitors. The data are well
replicated by a model driven by a galaxy-age varying $R_V$ and no intrinsic SN
luminosity difference, and we find that specific star-formation rate measured
locally to the SN is a relatively pure tracer of this galaxy age difference. We
cannot rule out an intrinsic difference causing part of the observed step and
show that if luminosity differences are caused by multiple drivers then no
single environmental measurement is able to accurately trace them. We encourage
the use of multiple tracers in luminosity corrections to negate this issue.

(syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine) chronic gastritis (CG) and Cold/Hot

Background: CG is a common inflammatory disease and the diagnosis of CG in TCM
can be classified into Cold ZHENG (Asthenic Cold) and Hot ZHENG (Excess Hot).
However, the molecular features of Cold/Hot ZHENG in CG and the mechanism of
Cold/Hot herbs in formulae for CG remained unclear. Methods: Based on data of
35 patients of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG and 3 scRNA-seq CG samples, we conduct
analysis with transcriptomics datasets and algorithms, to discover biomarkers
for Cold/Hot ZHENG CG. And we collected 25 formulae (with traditional effects
related to Cold/Hot ZHENG) for CG and corresponding 89 Cold/Hot herbs
(including Warm/Cool herbs) to discover features and construct target networks
of Cold/Hot herbs on the basis of network target and enrichment analysis.
Results: Biomarkers of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG represented by CCL2 and LEP suggested
that Hot ZHENG CG might be characterized by over-inflammation and exuberant
metabolism, and Cold ZHENG CG showed a trend of suppression in immune
regulation and energy metabolism. And biomarkers of Cold/Hot ZHENG showed also
significant changes in the progression of gastric cancer. And biomarkers and
pathways of Hot herbs intend to regulate immune responses and energy
metabolism, while those of Cold herbs were likely to participate in
anti-inflammation effect. Conclusion: In this study, we found that the
biomarkers and mechanism of Cold/Hot ZHENG CG and those of Cold/Hot herbs were
closely related to the regulation of immune and metabolisms. These findings may
reflect the mechanism, build bridges between multiple views of Cold/Hot ZHENG
and Cold/Hot herbs, and provide a research paradigm for further achieving
precision TCM.

accurate diagnosis possible for a process plant criticality is somehow
intrinsic in its functioning. Continuous monitoring is a possible way for early
detection. However, it is somehow fundamental to be able to actually simulate
failures. Reproducing the issues remotely allows to quantify in advance their
consequences, causing literally no real damage. Within this context, signed
directed graphs have played an essential role within the years, managing to
model with a relatively simple theory diverse elements of an industrial
network, as well as the logic relations between them.\\ In this work we present
a quantitative approach, employing directed graphs to the simulation and
automatic reconfiguration of a fault in a network. To model the typical
operation of industrial plants, we propose several additions with respect to
the standard graphs: 1. a quantitative measure to control the overall residual
capacity, 2. nodes of different categories - and then different behaviors - and
3. a fault propagation procedure based on the predecessors and the redundancy
of the system. The obtained graph is able to mimic the behaviour of the real
target plant when one or more faults occur. Additionally, we also implement a
generative approach capable to activate a particular category of nodes in order
to contain the issue propagation, equipping the network with the capability of
reconfigure itself and resulting then in a mathematical tool useful not only
for simulating and monitoring, but also to design and optimize complex plants.
The final asset of the system is provided in output with its complete
diagnostics, and a detailed description of the steps that have been carried out
to obtain the final realization.

unification allows us to identify a single full-stack paradigm, involving
Thermodynamic AI hardware, that could accelerate such algorithms. We contrast
Thermodynamic AI hardware with quantum computing where noise is a roadblock
rather than a resource. Thermodynamic AI hardware can be viewed as a novel form
of computing, since it uses a novel fundamental building block. We identify
stochastic bits (s-bits) and stochastic modes (s-modes) as the respective
building blocks for discrete and continuous Thermodynamic AI hardware. In
addition to these stochastic units, Thermodynamic AI hardware employs a
Maxwell's demon device that guides the system to produce non-trivial states. We

  The explicit dependence of the electronic dynamic structure factor (DSF) on
temperature and density is studied in a broad realm of variation of the
dimensionless parameters ($2\leq r_s\leq 36$ and $1\leq \theta \leq 8$). When
the coupling is strong ($r_s\geq 16$) we clearly observe a bi-modal structure
of the excitation spectrum with a lower-energy mode possessing a well
pronounced roton-like feature ($\theta \leq 2$) and an additional high-energy
branch within the roton region which evolves into the strongly overdamped
high-frequency shoulder when the coupling decreases ($r_s\leq 10$). We are not
aware of any reconstruction of the DSF at these conditions with the effects of
dynamical correlations, included here via the intermediate scattering and the
dynamical Nevanlinna parameter functions. The standard static-local-field

systems. As a vital capability evolutionary survival, it has been extensively

robotics due to its close relationship with collision detection and navigation.
Visual cues such as angular size, angular velocity, and expansion have been
widely studied for looming detection by means of optic flow or elementary
neural computing research. However, a critical visual motion cue has been long
neglected because it is so easy to be confused with expansion, that is
radial-opponent-motion (ROM). Recent research on the discovery of LPLC2, a
ROM-sensitive neuron in Drosophila, has revealed its ultra-selectivity because
it only responds to stimuli with focal, outward movement. This characteristic
of ROM-sensitivity is consistent with the demand for collision detection
because it is strongly associated with danger looming that is moving towards
the center of the observer. Thus, we hope to extend the well-studied neural
model of the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) with ROM-sensibility in
order to enhance robustness and accuracy at the same time. In this paper, we
investigate the potential to extend an image velocity-based looming detector,
the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD), with ROM-sensibility. To achieve
this, we propose the mathematical definition of ROM and its main property, the
radial motion opponency (RMO). Then, a synaptic neuropile that analogizes the
synaptic processing of LPLC2 is proposed in the form of lateral inhibition and
attention. Thus, our proposed model is the first to perform both image velocity

various durations of time-series data observed from driving behaviors. First,
we segment the driving time-series data into two road types, namely, arterial

naturally represented as ego graphs. However, most existing recommendation
methods collect these ego graphs from all users to compose a global graph to
obtain high-order collaborative information between users and items, and these
centralized CF recommendation methods inevitably lead to a high risk of user
privacy leakage. Although recently proposed federated recommendation systems
can mitigate the privacy problem, they either restrict the on-device local
training to an isolated ego graph or rely on an additional third-party server
to access other ego graphs resulting in a cumbersome pipeline, which is hard to
work in practice. In addition, existing federated recommendation systems
require resource-limited devices to maintain the entire embedding tables
resulting in high communication costs.
  In light of this, we propose a semi-decentralized federated ego graph

introduces new device-to-device collaborations to improve scalability and
reduce communication costs and innovatively utilizes predicted interacted item

mechanism to reach homochirality has not been shown to this date. The
chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect has established a strong coupling

for breaking the chiral molecular symmetry by spin-selective processes.
Magnetic surfaces can act as chiral agents due to the CISS effect and they can
be templates for the enantioselective crystallization of chiral molecules. Here
we studied the spin-selective crystallization of racemic ribo aminooxazoline

self-amplification by conglomerate crystallization of RAO. Our results
demonstrate a prebiotically plausible way of achieving systems level
homochirality from completely racemic starting materials.

  Vaca","Bayesian Optimization of ESG Financial Investments",,,,,"q-fin.PM cs.AI math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Financial experts and analysts seek to predict the variability of financial
markets. In particular, the correct prediction of this variability ensures
investors successful investments. However, there has been a big trend in
finance in the last years, which are the ESG criteria. Concretely, ESG
(Economic, Social and Governance) criteria have become more significant in
finance due to the growing importance of investments being socially
responsible, and because of the financial impact companies suffer when not
complying with them. Consequently, creating a stock portfolio should not only
take into account its performance but compliance with ESG criteria. Hence, this
paper combines mathematical modelling, with ESG and finance. In more detail, we
use Bayesian optimization (BO), a sequential state-of-the-art design strategy
to optimize black-boxes with unknown analytical and costly-to compute
expressions, to maximize the performance of a stock portfolio under the
presence of ESG criteria soft constraints incorporated to the objective
function. In an illustrative experiment, we use the Sharpe ratio, that takes
into consideration the portfolio returns and its variance, in other words, it
balances the trade-off between maximizing returns and minimizing risks. In the
present work, ESG criteria have been divided into fourteen independent
categories used in a linear combination to estimate a firm total ESG score.
Most importantly, our presented approach would scale to alternative black-box
methods of estimating the performance and ESG compliance of the stock
portfolio. In particular, this research has opened the door to many new
research lines, as it has proved that a portfolio can be optimized using a BO
that takes into consideration financial performance and the accomplishment of
ESG criteria.

  Resources",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support cybersecurity operations
is now a consolidated practice, e.g., to detect malicious code or configure
traffic filtering policies. The recent surge of AI, generative techniques and
frameworks with efficient natural language processing capabilities dramatically
magnifies the number of possible applications aimed at increasing the security
of the Internet. Specifically, the ability of ChatGPT to produce textual
contents while mimicking realistic human interactions can be used to mitigate
the plague of emails containing scams. Therefore, this paper investigates the
use of AI to engage scammers in automatized and pointless communications, with
the goal of wasting both their time and resources. Preliminary results showcase
that ChatGPT is able to decoy scammers, thus confirming that AI is an effective
tool to counteract threats delivered via mail. In addition, we highlight the
multitude of implications and open research questions to be addressed in the
perspective of the ubiquitous adoption of AI.

  accepted",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Our topic is performance differences between using random and chaos for
particle swarm optimization (PSO). We take random sequences with different
probability distributions and compare them to chaotic sequences with different
but also with same density functions. This enables us to differentiate between
differences in the origin of the sequences (random number generator or chaotic
nonlinear system) and statistical differences expressed by the underlying
distributions. Our findings (obtained by evaluating the PSO performance for
various benchmark problems using statistical hypothesis testing) cast
considerable doubt on previous results which compared random to chaos and
suggested that the choice leads to intrinsic differences in performance.

  Options",,,,,"q-fin.PR cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Liquidations in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) are both a blessing and a curse
-- whereas liquidations prevent lenders from capital loss, they simultaneously
lead to liquidation spirals and system-wide failures. Since most lending and
borrowing protocols assume liquidations are indispensable, there is an
increased interest in alternative constructions that prevent immediate
systemic-failure under uncertain circumstances.
  In this work, we introduce reversible call options, a novel financial
primitive that enables the seller of a call option to terminate it before
maturity. We apply reversible call options to lending in DeFi and devise
Miqado, a protocol for lending platforms to replace the liquidation mechanisms.
To the best of our knowledge, Miqado is the first protocol that actively
mitigates liquidations to reduce the risk of liquidation spirals. Instead of
selling collateral, Miqado incentivizes external entities, so-called
supporters, to top-up a borrowing position and grant the borrower additional
time to rescue the debt. Our simulation shows that Miqado reduces the amount of
liquidated collateral by 89.82% in a worst-case scenario.

  Discussion Paper",,,,"physics.soc-ph stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Criteria for a good voting system have been given particularly careful
scrutiny in recent years, with general agreement that the core values are fair
results, voter power and choice, and local representation.
  This paper reexamines the basic ideas of three widely used voting systems,
the Single Transferable Vote, List-PR, and Mixed Member Proportional (MMP); and
evaluates their performance in terms of both principles and practice.
  It looks particularly closely at proportionality, examining three aspects:n
linearity, the threshold for representation and the threshold for gaining a
majority.
  As regards local representation, an important question is how to design
multi-member constituencies. It will be argued that using constituencies based
on natural demographic boundaries (such as local government areas) can combine
better local representation with stability over time and better
proportionality.
  STV is unsurprisingly best for voter empowerment and choice, as those are
parts of its basic idea.
  Broad conclusions are summarised within the Summary on page 1 of the paper.
  The paper makes use of recent public availability of large preferential
voting data sets for STV elections, making possible new analyses of how STV
functions in practice, and of voter behaviour, particularly examining how
voters' second preferences relate to their first preferences.

  decompositions of mixtures",,,,,"cs.PL cs.CL cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes an unsupervised classification method that partitions a
set of files into non-overlapping dialects based upon their behaviors,
determined by messages produced by a collection of programs that consume them.
The pattern of messages can be used as the signature of a particular kind of
behavior, with the understanding that some messages are likely to co-occur,
while others are not. Patterns of messages can be used to classify files into
dialects. A dialect is defined by a subset of messages, called the required
messages. Once files are conditioned upon dialect and its required messages,
the remaining messages are statistically independent.
  With this definition of dialect in hand, we present a greedy algorithm that
deduces candidate dialects from a dataset consisting of a matrix of
file-message data, demonstrate its performance on several file formats, and
prove conditions under which it is optimal. We show that an analyst needs to
consider fewer dialects than distinct message patterns, which reduces their
cognitive load when studying a complex format.
